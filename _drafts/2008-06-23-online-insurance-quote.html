The events that are covered and the extent of coverage for each event are defined in the contract.</p><p>Thus, there are three parties to any insurance contract – the policyholder, the insured, and the insurance company. In most cases, the insured and the policyholder are the same. The event(s) covered by the insurance contract will largely define what kind of insurance  it is.
