 With a little bit of effort and a microphone, you can use podcasting to talk with millions of people. They key is creating something that is worth listening to.<br /></p><br /></p>The term "Podcasting" surfaced in 2004 when early-adopters combined the words "iPod" and "broadcasting." Podcast listeners typically download audio files in MP3 format onto a computer and transfer the files to their MP3 player. The advantage of podcasting over streaming media is its portability. <br /></p><br /></p>Podcasting enables independent content producers to create self-published, syndicated "radio shows" on virtually any topic and make them available to millions of potential “on-demand” listeners. Podcasts are subscription based, allowing users to automatically download new episodes as they become available. <br /></p><br /></p>A recent phone survey of adults over the age of 18 by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, found that more than 22 million American adults own iPods or MP3 players. 29% of them (almost 6.5 million) have downloaded podcasts from the Web so that they could listen to audio files at a time of their choosing.<br /></p><br /></p>According to the survey: 13% of men have MP3 players, compared to 9% of women; 19% of those ages 18-28 have MP3 players;14% of those ages 29-40 have them; 14% of internet users have MP3 players, compared to 3% of non-internet users. The survey showed that there is no notable gap between those who have broadband access and dial-up users when it comes to podcasting.<br /></p><br /></p>In 2004, podcasting was viewed as an “independent” media source.  In 2005, it’s mainstream. National Public Radio has recently jumped into podcasting, introducing a directory with 130 public radio podcasts. The service is in beta, but already represents a strong commitment toward podcasting. Featured podcasts include Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know?, NPR's daily news summaries, and topical podcasts on books, health and science and music. <br /></p><br /></p>Since podcasting features are built into Apple’s I-tunes software, independent podcasts now appear in the Apple Music store next to podcasts from Major ESPN, Disney, Fox and others.  <br /></p><br /></p>If you’re interested in podcasting your own content, There are several web sites that can teach you the basic mechanics of recording and distributing a podcast. However, be aware that a good podcast is harder to maintain than a blog. And, like blogs, they are prone to abandonment, obscurity, and failure. <br /></p><br /></p> To ensure success, consider these recommendations:<br /></p><br /></p><B>Be Prepared</b><br /></p>Podcasting can be done on a shoestring. That doesn’t mean it should be done without preparation. Get a good microphone and headset and some decent audio editing software such as Garage Band (Mac) or Sound Forge (PC). A good microphone and headset will reduce ambient, environmental noise. Good editing software will allow you to record the program in segments and mix them together with audio from other sources.<br /></p><br /></p><B>Be Passionate</B><br /></p>Podcasting an active medium.  Individuals select the podcasts they want to listen to based on their interests. They expect podcasts to be on-topic and podcasting hosts to be passionate about the topics they discuss. If you choose to podcast, select a topic that interests you and that is likely to attract listeners with the same interest.<br /></p><br /></p><B>Be Personal</b><br /></p>Podcasting engages listeners on a one-to-one level. Listeners  imagine what podcasters are talking about throughout the podcast. Radio broadcasters call this “the theatre of the mind.” Take advantage of your one-on-one relationship by challenging listeners to interact with you on a personal level.  Some of the most popular independent podcasts achieved their fame by inviting listeners to participate by email or telephone.<br /></p><br /></p><B>Be Consistent</b><br /></p>The content, duration and format your podcast needs to be consistent.  Although these vary greatly from show to show.  Listeners expect that a podcast they subscribed to will be the same from show to show. And, that shows will be added at regular intervals.<br /></p><br /></p>Wisconsin Podcaster Chuck Tomasi recommends that podcasters record 5-6 shows and listen to them first before going public. It usually takes that long, he said, for prodcasters to establish their broadcast format, personality and rhythm.  <br /></p><br /></p>Tomasi  encourages businesses to explore opportunities where podcasting integrates naturally into their business: as a companion to the corporate newsletter, a tool for customer support, or a means of demonstrating consulting expertise. <br /></p><br /></p>“Find something that you’re interested in -- passionate about -- and have some expertise and go with it,” Tomasi said. He and his co-host Kreg Steppe use their podcast entitled <a href="http://www.chuckchat.com/" target=link>Technorama</a> to discuss recent events and stories in the tech world.<br /></p>
