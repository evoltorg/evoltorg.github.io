<b>Part 1. About MOD and TOD files</b><br /></p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3324/3505703167_e6ab9a2268_o.png" /></p>    <p>MOD and TOD are informal names of tapeless video formats used by JVC (MOD and TOD), Panasonic (MOD only) and Canon (MOD only) in some models of digital camcorders. Format names correspond to extensions of video files. Both MOD and TOD are file-based formats that are stored on a random-access media. Directory structure and naming convention are identical except for extensions of media files.</p> </p>    <p>Standard definition video is stored in MPEG-2 program stream container files with MOD extension; in most other systems these files have extension MPG or MPEG. High definition video is stored in MPEG-2 transport stream container files with TOD extension; in most other systems these files have M2T extension. Transport stream files can be converted into more common program stream files without recompressing the video itself.</p> </p><br /></p><p><b>Part 2.

How to play MOD/TOD files on Mac?</b></p>    <p>MOD/TOD video files are nothing but MPEG-2 files with AC3 (MPEG-1 layer2 for TOD files) audio. So .MOD and .TOD files can be easily renamed into .MV2 or .MPG files and then be read easily by most video playback tools.</p></p>    <p>You can use <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html">VLC Media Player</a> or <a href="http://mplayerosx.sourceforge.net/">MPlayer OS X</a> to play MOD files on Mac. They are all free.</p></p>    <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3312/3444124340_307537867d.jpg" /></p><br /></p><p><b>Part 4. MOD/TOD Video Files Conversion Issues</b></p>    <p>But those videos, renamed with other extension directly, may be not compatible with your player or editor completely. You may lose some segments unexpectedly. And those crude footages are uncomfortable for viewing without editing and rearrangement. Re-encode your video with a video converter for mac, you can view them smoothly on QuickTime, iPod, iPhone, Apple TV or edit them to be a real movie with iMovie or Final Cut Pro.</p></p>    <p>The best free way is change video extension and convert renamed videos with <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/19769/isquint">iSquint</a> - an easy to use and totally free video converter for Mac.
