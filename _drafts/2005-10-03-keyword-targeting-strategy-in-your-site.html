Once the keywords have been decided for the site one has to come up with a strategy to target those keywords across the site. Here is a primer on that.</p><p>Keywords Targeting Strategy for Keyword of Single word:</p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Keyword of Single word is useful to attract general audience and helps in getting high rank ,if the web site is new. Keywords Targeting Strategy for Keyword of Single word is that they should be more used in the root level pages or top level domain pages. This is because these pages are the ones that attract the general traffic & are generally the pages which do not specify specifics. Hence single word keywords based on themes can be targeted for on these pages. </p><p>Keywords Targeting Strategy for Keyword of Multiple words:</p>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Keyword of Multiple words are useful for attract targeted audience therefore should be used topic wise for each page according to subject of that web page. Relevant set of Keywords should be use in Title tag, Header Tag, Meta tag, Body tag, Alt tag, Anchor tag, Comment tag and in the url (uniform resource locator) of that specific web page. Use underscore or hyphen to differentiate Keywords. These keywords are normally targeted upon in deeper level or sub directory level pages.</p><p>Keywords Targeting Strategy for Keyword based on Theme:</p>------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Keyword based on theme is useful to attract targeted audience therefore they are strongly recommended to be used. Typically, although it is not a hard and fast rule but in theme based keyword we use general keywords in root level and uses specific keyword in directory level.</p><p>Overall one can safely say that in keyword targeting one uses a dart board strategy. Wherein the smallest circle attracts your core audience & hence should have theme oriented multiple word keywords. As we move up on the theme (dartboard) the circle ( traffic) tends to get larger & the keywords tends to get simpler( singular) even though they are theme based.   </p><p>KEYWORDS and KEYPHRASES usage in Domain Name: </p>--------------------------------------------</p><p>Keywords and keyphrases use in Domain Name & urls of directory pages is also a  factor in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) as well as it helps to inform targeted audience, about the sites content . Therefore, special care should be exercised in choosing a domain name. All the search engines start reading each web page with its respective domain name. </p><p>Having said that, let me add that there is a raging debate amongst the seo community to determine the exact importance of keywords in the domain name. One camp believes that it is hugely important to have keywords in domain whereas the other maintains that brand building domain name is more important than keywords incorporating one. </p><p>Whether keyword is a factor or not is debateble however it has been observed that domain name extensions do definitely play a part in rankings. Search engines ( specially google) have a predilection for sites having extension  .gov,.edu,.mil in domain name. Search engines believe that information available at these domains would have a greater likelihood of being authentic as no commercial interest is served here. </p><p>Domain Name can be classifieds into two categories: </p><p>1. Keyword Specific </p><p>2. Brand Name Specific</p><p>Keyword Specific Domain Name </p>----------------------------</p><p>When Keywords and Keyphrases are used in a Domain name then its called Keyword specific Domain name. </p><p>Keyword in the domain name to my mind has two advantages. </p><p>One It is better to have a keyword domain name for it is worth remembering that most of the people link to you using your URL. If your URL has the keyword or the keyphrase then you are automatically using the keyword in the very important anchor tag. </p><p>Secondly, though marginally, in a ranking scenario with every other parameter remaining equal, the Keyword Specific Domain Name will enjoy a slight edge over the other web site. However remember Keyword used in Domain name should be primary and generic. Specific keywords can be used in the sub domains. Read about the use of subdomains. </p><p>Keywords and Keyphrases uses with hyphen/underscore in Domain name are said to preferred as they are read by search engines as separate words. So the domain name can have a search phrase incorporated into it. However the flip side of it is that domain names with hyphen or underscore  are inconvenient to carry. </p><p>Brand Name Specific Domain Name </p>-------------------------------</p><p>When company or organizations’ name is used in Domain Name to brand it  then it’s called as Brand Name Specific Domain name. </p><p>Brand Name Specific Domain Name does not help online searches at all. However they are very powerful tools for company identification in the mind of users. In the anonymous online world a brand spells loyalty, trust & value. So if you choose to go for building your brand rather than deep rooted optimization, one way of incorporating keywords is through your directories & pages names. </p><p>KEYWORD DENSITY </p>---------------</p><p>Keyword Density is a proportion of the searched term ( Keyword or Keyphrase) against the whole words written on a given page. The ideal Keyword Density is 6%-8% though various search engines have various  tolerance levels before their spam filters get activated. Higher Keyword Density does help to boost a pages’ ranking. </p><p>Keyword Density can be increased by using target keywords repeatedly in Title tag, Header tag, Body tag, Comment tag, Alt tag, Anchor tag, Paragraph Tag , Domain name and in diretory/page names. </p><p>However one disadvantage of trying to hike the keyword density is that the  visible text on the page starts to look spammy if it is not carefully crafted. That makes for a bad copy.
