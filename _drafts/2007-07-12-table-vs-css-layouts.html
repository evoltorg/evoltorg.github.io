<h2>The Future If Presenting Data</h2></p><p><p>The future of the Web will revolve around using full CSS web layouts rather than table-based Web design.</p>The difference is in positioning DIV areas with CSS, rather than using tables to hold the content together,</p>which should be reserved for presenting data.</p></p><p><h3>Why Table-Based Web Design is Bad Form</h3></p><p><p>Tables are designed to display tabular data; not for creative Web page layouts. However, that doesn't mean</p>we should get rid of, or ignore, tables completely in our markup. Tables are still a vital part of HTML,</p>as they retain their usefulness in marking up tabular data such as calendars.</p></p><p><p>Here are a few reasons that table-based design has become bad form in Web design:</p></p><ul></p><li>In table-based design, a website's content and markup are combined in one document, making page file sizes</p>unnecessarily large. This forces site visitors to download presentational table data for every page they visit on a site.</li></p><p><li>Table-based design can make it hard to maintain visual consistency throughout a site.</li></p><p><li>It's much more difficult to design a table-based Web layout that complies with accessibility</p>laws and standards for the disabled or those accessing the Web via cell phones and PDAs.</p>For example, an audio browser will typically read the contents of a table from left to right and top to bottom.</p>If a designer uses tables to layout a site's content in a vertical fashion (with the intention to read content down the first column,</p>then to the top of the second column, etc.), the screen reader will be reading content out of order, causing confusion to the listener.</li></p><p><li>Markup language isn't intended to define display elements of a document, despite the fact</p>that display and structural elements are oftenintimately connected.</li></p></ul></p><p><h3>Benefits of Using CSS in Web Design</h3></p><p><p><strong>Semantic Mark-up</strong> - It's easier to achieve a semantic mark-up (strongly recommended by w3c) using CSS design.</p>What this means is that code should be meaningful as well as syntactically correct. In order to have semantic meaning,</p>your DIVs should be assigned descriptive IDs (eg., Assign &lt;div id="content"&gt; to your main content area,</p>wrap headings in &lt;h1&gt; tags, subheadings in &lt;h2&gt; tags, paragraphs in &lt;p&gt; tags, etc.</p>It also means using &lt;strong&gt; tags as opposed to &lt;b&gt; tags for bold text and &lt;em&gt;</p>tags instead of &lt;i&gt; tags for italicized or emphasized text.)</p>Essentially, the descriptive IDs allow your markup to convey meaning to the reader.</p></p><p><p><strong>Less Bandwidth Usage</strong> - When using CSS design techniques, a site's actual HTML files are separate from your CSS markup,</p>with both files being caches separately in the browser. This saves bandwidth, because the CSS file detailing design elements</p>only has to be downloaded by the visitor once, as opposed to table-based designs, where the full layout must be downloaded</p>with every page load. By converting a table-based Web design into a CSS design, you can often decrease the page size by 50-60%.</p></p><p><p><strong>Better SEO</strong> - CSS designs are better for your search engine optimization efforts, because CSS allows you to separate the page's</p>structure from its presentation elements.  This improves your code to content ratio (under the concept that the more text versus</p>code is present in your page, the better your site will rank in search engines because of relevancy factors).</p></p><p><img src="http://www.redflymarketing.com/media/rfm.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:10px" /></p><p><em>Image Credit: <a href="http://www.redflymarketing.com">www.RedFlyMarketing.com</a></em></p></p><p><em>The RedFly Marketing homepage demonstrates the SEO benefit of content positioning in a CSS Web layout. If this design were</p>created in a table-based layout, search engines would read the left column's content (less important) before the main content</p>area in the center of the page (most important for SEO purposes to determine relevancy of keywords in a page).</em></p></p><p><p>This can also aid in displaying more relevant contextual ads when using contextual advertising networks such as</p>Google Adsense or the Yahoo! Publisher Network, which can lead to increased conversions and income. By minimizing</p>the amount of code as compared to content, you're also making it easier for search engines to spider your site,</p>due to the fact that the code is more structured and simplified.</p></p><p><p>Yet another SEO benefit of CSS design is that a designer has the ability to manipulate the order of data as</p>it will be presented to search engines. This means that the most important areas of a site (such as the main content block)</p>can be placed earlier in the site's code than a less important element (such as a sidebar navigational menu).</p></p><p><p><strong>Easier Design Changes</strong> - CSS design makes it much easier to make small changes to design elements sitewide</p>(such as content fonts or colors), because a single value changed in a single stylesheet can instantly change</p>the appearance of an element across an entire website, where all pages are referencing the same CSS file.</p>Even complete site redesigns are much easier, because the complete layout of the site is controlled through one external CSS file.</p></p><p><p><strong>Better Accessibility</strong> - Accessibility is greatly enhanced with the use of CSS. CSS-based layouts allow multiple</p>Web-enabled devices (such as PDAs, cell phones, and TV-based browsers) to draw on the same source pages, all while</p>being displayed in entirely different styles.  The same is true of "printer-friendly" pages, where using a simple</p>alternative CSS file will remove images and navigation for a printable display of content. Essentially, one page serves all purposes.</p></p><p><p><em>Image Credits: <a href="http://www.redflystudios.com">www.RedFlyStudios.com</a></em></p></p><p><p><em>The following images display how one Web page can be displayed in a Web-friendly format as well as a printer-friendly format</p>using a single CSS file. Both images below are from the RedFly Studios homepage. Figure 1 illustrates the homepage as displayed</p>on the Web, while Figure 2 illustrates the same page displayed in its printer-friendly format (minus the large header graphic).</em></p></p><p><p><strong>Figure 1 Web Display</strong><br /></p><img src="http://www.redflymarketing.com/media/rfs-layout.jpg" /></p></p>   </p><p><p><strong>Figure 2: Print Display</strong><br /></p><img src="http://www.redflymarketing.com/media/rfs-print.jpg" /></p></p> </p><h3>Potential Challenges of CSS Layouts</h3></p><p><p><strong>Browser Compatibility</strong> - While the latest browser versions have little problem with displaying CSS-based Web designs,</p>older browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4.x and Internet Explorer 4.x and earlier can only display very basic CSS commands,</p>whereas more complex stylesheets can cause display problems.</p></p><p><p><strong>Difficulty in Switching from Tables to CSS</strong> - Using CSS for Web layouts requires a different line of thinking than using tables.</p>This means that some designers may have trouble adapting from a table-based design method that they've used for years to CSS-based design.</p></p><p><h3>Layout Examples - A Simple 3-Column Fixed Width Layout</h3></p><p><h4>1.) Table-Based Layout</h4></p><code></p><table width="760"  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"></p>  <tr></p>    <td colspan="3">HEADER</td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr></p>    <td width="180">LEFT</td></p>    <td>CONTENT</td></p>    <td width="180">RIGHT</td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr></p>    <td colspan="3">FOOTER</td></p>  </tr></p></table></p></code></p><p><h4>2.) CSS Layout</h4></p><p><p><strong>The CSS</strong></p></p><code></p>body {</p>	text-align:center; /*required for centering the page in IE */</p>	}</p>#wrapper {</p>	text-align: left;</p>	margin: 0px auto; /* centering the page */</p>	padding: 0px;</p>	border:0;</p>	width: 760px; /* width of the page */</p>}</p>#header {</p>	margin: 0 0 15px 0;</p>	height: 50px;</p>}</p>#left {</p>	float: left;</p>	width: 180px;</p>}</p>#right {</p>	float: right;</p>	width: 180px;</p>}</p>#content { </p>	float: left;</p>	width: 400px;</p>}</p>#footer {</p>	clear: both;</p>	height: 30px;</p>}</p></code></p><br /></p><p><strong>The HTML</strong></p></p><code></p><div id="wrapper"></p>	<div id="header">HEADER</div></p>	<div id="container"></p>		<div id="left">LEFT</div></p>		<div id="content">CONTENT</div></p>		<div id="right">RIGHT</div></p>	</div></p>	<div id="footer">FOOTER</div></p></div></p></code></p><p>When it comes to professional Web design, using CSS and semantic HTML is the only way to go moving forward.</p>If you are a beginner, hopefully the above example will give you a good starting point, in demonstrating the simplification of code in CSS design.</p></p></p>There are plenty of resources on the Internet that can help you learn more about CSS and semantic HTML, so stick with it and learn</p>how you can make the Web a better place!</p></p><br /></p><p><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/synd/2002/03/01/css_layout.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/synd/2002/03/01/css_layout.html</a></p></p><p><p><a href="http://newsletter.refinery.com/e_article000166191.cfm">http://newsletter.refinery.com/e_article000166191.cfm</a></p></p><p><p><a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2003/02/21/tables-vs-css">http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2003/02/21/tables-vs-css</a></p></p>
