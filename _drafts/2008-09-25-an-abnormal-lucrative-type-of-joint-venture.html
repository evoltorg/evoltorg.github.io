Joint-Venturing doesn't end on asking a Guru to endorse your stuff. But that's what the majority of people in the Internet marketing world focus on. </p><p>Here's an unusual & insanely profitable kind of JV: </p><p>Co-author with a Guru. </p><p>Yes, you better know what your stuff. And no – it’s not for you if you aren’t damn serious. Because it takes a lot of work & brings in a lot of cash. Not for the easy-goers. </p><p>But why would the guru want to do this? </p>Because it saves them time & gets them easy bucks! </p><p>Every guru has at least a dozen product ideas that they doesn't have time for. If you offer </p>to do all the work & still give them 60% or more - there's no way they're going to miss it! </p><p>You can also make a product specifically FOR one guru's viewers. But that's another story. </p><p>Here's a tip: Ask the guru for an incomplete product. </p><p>Many gurus start a product but for some reason it's pushed aside half-way down. They want that product to see the light of the day but they don't have time for it or maybe they've just moved on. </p><p>But if you offer to complete that product, they will love you for it! </p><p>Take all the work on yourself. From finishing the product to writing the sales copy & auto-responder messages. Save them the headache, their time, energy & money - & they'll be happy to co-author with you. </p><p>What’s in it for you? (as if you need to ask!) </p><p>Because just one product can launch you to stardom. When people see you co-authored an ebook with a victorious guru - you get instant credibility. And of course the money comes rolling in faster than you can count - because the guru obviously has a loyal following. </p><p>And then people will be contacting YOU for joint-ventures! The integrity, the money, and the contacts - it's all worth it. </p><p>There are many examples of people who launched their online this way. Here are 3 case-studies: </p><p>I can't say if he launched his online career this way. But this guy has authored at least half a dozen books with the top guns in this industry. </p><p>The one that gave him the first real boost was "How to write an ebook in 7 days or less” that he co-authored with Joe Vitale. </p><p>The story is - Jim Edwards asked Joe Vitale to give him any old document of him that he could turn into an ebook. After constant request - Joe gave him a book he authored long ago - on how to write a book in a record time. </p><p>Jim edited it a bit & then turned it into "How to write an ebook in 7 days or less". It became an instant best seller & gave Jim his first shot of fame. </p><p>Since then - Jim has co-authored with more Gurus than I can count. And today he's a big Guru himself! Smart, eh? </p><p>His story is so simple - it'd be hard to believe. </p><p>Larry wrote a swipe file of rhythmic words & phrases. Then he wrote to Joe Vitale that since 'hypnotic' is his brand - Joe can review it & if he wants - add some hypnotic phrases himself & they'll co-author it. </p><p>Joe agreed & yes magnetic swipe file' sold like crazy. Today Larry got 4-6 other soothing ebooks co-authored with Joe. </p><p>Nitro marketing that multi-million-dollar IM company promotes 90% of Joe Vitale's products including the ones he co-authored with Larry. </p><p>So Larry’s is promoted by nitro-marketing & he’ll keep getting royalty from them for decades to come. </p><p>Last year - Joe said he hasn't seen, met or even heard Larry’s voice! I doubt if they've even met now - yet the story & success is surprising. </p><p>Tell man is an NLP expert. I don't know how he got his start online but his first few products where - 'Think like' series. </p><p>He did it Chip Traver, Shawn Casey, Joe Vitale & probably others. The one that got famous was ‘Think like Joe Vitale'. </p><p>Another product he did was 'Nitro Mindset' with the nitro marketing guys. Then he started "List Crusade" where he interviewed (& still does) gurus every week. </p><p>These are all different kinds of JVs. Not the usual milking-the-big-guru please-endorse-me type of ones. I can't say if this way is harder or easier but one thing is for sure - they 10x more profitable. </p><p><a href="http://www.joint-venture-guide.com">www.joint-venture-guide.com</a></p><a href="http://www.jointventure.infozabout.com">www.jointventure.infozabout.com</a></p><p>
