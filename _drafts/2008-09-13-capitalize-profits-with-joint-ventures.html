There are many dissimilar ways to find joint venture partners. In this article I will show you several. Also some more targeted strategies you could use to get other marketers to promote your niche products and web site. </p><p>A joint venture is where you contact a marketer in your niche market that has an email list of subscribers who may have an interest in your product. These are the backbone of your business. Just five decent joint venture partners who promote your ebook to their email list in replace for a commission can put your current income through the roof. Read this newsletter and go out and take action. I assure you your results can be life changing. </p><p>Know Your change Rate </p><p>The first oversight beginners make is to start contacting JV partners left right and centre before they've even made a sale of their ebook themselves. This is wrong. Very wrong. You need to be able to contact a potential JV partner and be able to tell them how your sites converting. </p><p>Site edition is simple. It's the amount of visitors to the amount of visitors who buy. So for example if one hundred people visited your site and two bought your conversion is two percent. You want to get at least one thousand visitors before you know your conversion. </p><p>To work out how your sites converting download the software from one of the many statistics sites. Don't worry it won't cost you a penny. </p><p>Offer Large Commissions </p><p>Once you know how well your sites converting (if no one's buying don't even bother contacting marketers. You have to work to improve your sales letter, maybe change your headline, really whatever you have to do to see results) before you can start contacting JV partners. You should offer your JV partners a larger incentive than your usual affiliates. If you offer your affiliates fifty percent commission, offer your JV partners seventy five percent. </p><p>OK, I can almost hear you thinking "whoa up, hang on there‚Äù wait a sec. those commissions are huge? I won't make any money myself". This is where so many go wrong. If people are sending you tons of visitors you can build your email list and offer them other products in email promotions, and you can also make money selling back end products. </p><p>Return The Favour </p><p>Offering high commissions is not enough. Tell them that you'll add a message into your auto responder set up so that you'll market their products via an affiliate link in your back end. Explain that you'll be setting up joint ventures with other marketers in the niche so that they'll get visitors to their site without expenditure a dime. </p><p>Using Clickbank </p><p>Please, please understand one thing. If you're selling an ebook on fitness don't start contacting marketers who sell gardening products. That's just ridiculous. Only contact marketers who sell products aimed at your niche market and therefore have an email or customer list of people who may have an interest in your ebook. </p><p>From the home page you would find the list of products in your niche by clicking on "promote products" then searching the marketplace"promote products" on the home page and then search the marketplace for products in your niche. Contact the product owners and try setting up a JV. </p><p>Google "Ezine" Trick </p><p>This is a great way to find marketers with ready made email lists they can send a promotion to and sell tons of copies of your ebook virtually overnight. </p><p>Go to Google and type in "(niche) ezine". So for example if you were selling a bass fishing related ebook you'd type in "bass fishing ezine". What you'll get is a huge list of results of web sites in which people have a bass fishing email newsletter (or ezine). Obviously they won't all have one, often you'll get millions of results, but you can spend a few hours going through the results and get more JV contacts than you could ever hope for! </p><p>Google "Allintitle" Trick </p><p>Here's another cracker. Do you think web sites that have your niche market keyword in their domain name might be great potential JV partners? Of course! Go to google and type in "allintitle: (niche)" So for example if you were selling an ebook on song writing you'd type "allintitle:song writing" into google. Go through the results contacting marketers and setting up hugely gainful joint ventures. </p><p>Leverage Results </p><p>Once you set up one lucrative JV use the results to start setting up even more joint ventures. You can say things like "Joe blogs from domain X amount of sales and earned X amount from just one mailing to his list". This really is powerful because it shows people that you know what you're doing. </p><p>Now go and take action. You really can set up joint ventures with any niche markets top guns if you go and actually do it.
