Here are some of the features in this Login System that weren't included in the initial tutorial:</p><p>    * Better Security - Passwords are not stored in cookies, randomly generated ids take their place.</p>    * Member Levels - Now users can be differentiated by what level they are (user, admin, etc.)</p>    * Admin Center - As an admin, you have full control over registered users. You can view user info, upgrade/demote user levels, delete users, delete inactive users, and ban users.</p>    * Visitor Tracking - You can now tell how many guests and users are actively viewing your site, and who those users are. You also know how many total members your site has.</p>    * Account Info - Users can now view their own information, and edit it as well. They can also see the information of other users.</p>    * Form Helper - No more ugly error pages! Now users are redirected to the form they filled out and the errors that have occurred are displayed.</p>    * Forgot Password - Users who forget their password can have a new one generated for them and sent to their email address.</p>    * Email - Now emails can be sent to newly registered users.</p>    * Miscellaneous - Much better code design, smooth page transitions, and MORE!
