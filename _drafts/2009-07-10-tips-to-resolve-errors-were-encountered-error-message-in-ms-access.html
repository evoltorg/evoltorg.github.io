Tables in MS Access database are the primary storage components to save maximum amount of data. Data in tables is stored in the form of rows and columns. Being a technical component, tables are highly vulnerable to corruption due to file system corruption, simultaneous execution of more than two employees, MS Office malfunctioning, virus infection and more. Once the table gets corrupted due to any of the above reasons, then the data stored in it either shows wrong records or you encounter an error message. To overcome these hazards, an ideal solution is to restore the data from an updated backup. However, if no backup is available or backup fails to restore the required data, then you will need to use effective <a href="http://www.repair-access-file.com/">access repair</a> application.</p><p>As a practical instance, you encounter the below error message when you attempt to close the table after making some changes in the Employee table:</p><p>“Errors were encountered during the save operation.”</p><p>Data stored in the employees table gets corrupted after the above error message appears. In addition, you view incorrect values when you try to view the records of the Employee table.</p><p>Cause:</p><p>Three main causes for the occurrence of the above error message are discussed below:</p><p>	File corruption</p>	MaxLocksPerFile value that is too low </p>	Table has an internal column count that is too high.</p><p>Resolution:</p>For complete repair of Employee table, you will need to use an inbuilt repair utility known as “Compact and Repair.” To use the utility, you will need to follow the below steps:</p><p>1.	Firstly, you will need to go to the Tools menu and select Database Utilities and then click Compact and Repair Database.</p>2.	Next, locate and then click the database in the ‘Database to Compact From’ dialog box, and then click Compact.</p>3.	Finally, you will need to select an appropriate folder location for the new file in the ‘Compact Database Into’ dialog box, type a unique name for the file and then click on Save.</p><p>In most cases, the inbuilt repair utility repairs your table. However, the utility fails to repair if the table is of large size or has been corrupted badly. To repair the table in such situations, you will need to opt for efficient Access Repair application. Such Access Database Repair applications employ advanced scanning algorithms to scan and repair the corrupted database components. </p><p>Stellar Phoenix <a href="http://www.access-recovery-software.com/">access recovery</a> is a feature rich Access Database Repair tool.
