<p>Mimesis is a php4 flat file database class library.</p></p><p><p>Mimesis mimics the behavior of a standard SQL database but without using SQL. Instead, using php's object oriented programming features Mimesis functions as a distinct class with various database manipulation methods.</p></p><p><p>Mimesis also attempts to guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably by ensuring the following:</p></p><p><ul></p><li>Atomicity</li></p><li>Consistency</li></p><li>Isolation</li></p><li>Durability</li></p></ul></p><p><p>Mimesis stands out from the rest because it uses standard php files to store all the contents of the database. This means the only file permissions that need be worried about are those which allow your script to read, write, and execute php scripts locally on your server. No hassle involved if your server doesn't empirically respect file permissions.</p></p><p><p>Mimesis also implements a code-based file-locking mechanism rather than relying on php's native (and situationally unreliable) flock function.</p>
