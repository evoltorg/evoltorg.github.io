It is the goal of every website to be on the top of the search engine page results. The driving force behind this goal is the fact that search engines are the number 1 provider of website traffic – not just traffic but targeted site traffic. The websites that are currently on the top of SERPs are those with higher ranks and quality content. </p><p>Why do these websites rank high on the search engines? They are on the position they are in right now because they have utilized web marketing strategies aside from their original content. If you want to have the same fate as these sites, then don’t you think it’s time to start working on web marketing strategies too? After working on changes to your site, you must first wait until the changes have been indexed by the search engines. It is only until that time will you be able to evaluate whether the change you have made creates positive or negative results.</p><p>How can you make sure that your web marketing efforts will not be put in vain? What guarantee can you give your site that your strategies will have a constructive result? Here are the steps you need to increase your site’s rank the guaranteed ways:</p><p><b>•	Quit tricking the search engines.</b><br><br></p><p>Search engines can identify whether you are playing tricks on them. Be legitimate in the strategies you are using. Search engines are most likely to penalize your site for tricking them. What do you need to avoid? There are a number of tricks to avoid including keyword stuffing, hidden text, search engine cloaking, duplicate sites and link farms.</p><p><b>•	Page Title Optimization.</b><br><br></p><p>What is a page title? It is the heading of the page that usually appears at the top of the browser’s window. The page title should be relevant to the page itself. Each of the pages of a website must have a unique page title. Unique page titles will increase the chance for each of the pages to be indexed properly. There are cases where the search engines refrain from indexing the pages of a particular site thinking that the pages are just the same because they have the same page title. This is the reason why you should provide each page a unique page title.</p><p><b>•	Meta Tags Optimization.</b><br><br></p><p>What are Meta Tags? Meta Tags are the data you place in the HTML header of a web page. The Meta Tags provide information to the search engines. The information it provides is visible to the search engines but invisible to online users. To rank well on the search engines, optimize the Meta tags specifically the keyword and description tags. As much as you need unique page titles, you also need unique Meta Tags for your site’s pages.</p><p><b>•	Search Engine Friendly Internal Links.</b><br><br></p><p>It is important that you establish internal links that are search engine friendly. In doing so, remember that the search engines can read html links easily compared to any other type of files. To allow better indexing of all the pages of your site, include a site map page. This will help the search engine crawlers and spiders to crawl every page of the website.</p><p>How long have you been asking for steps that guarantee higher ranks and better listing on the search engine result pages? Well, here they are. Follow these steps and see your site jump from one rank to the next until it reaches the top position!</p>
