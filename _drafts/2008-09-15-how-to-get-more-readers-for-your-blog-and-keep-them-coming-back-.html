While in the beginning blogs were created more for personal use, as the internet and businesses develop more and more companies are using blogs to help promote their business, but the basics remain the same.</p><p>Whether you have a business blog or a personal one you no doubt want as many people to view it and hopefully interact with it, and you, as possible. There are a few key things to remember when both primarily creating your blog and then promoting it to others. </p><p>First and foremost keep your readers in mind; even if you have a blog that is full of nothing more than your personal rants, if you want people to keep coming back you need to make it easy to read and understand. Remember that in this day and age people using the internet will often spend a lot of time just skimming over pages so you need to capture and then keep their interest, the best way to do this is to keep your writing clear and concise, while it doesn’t need to be grammatically ideal (at least for a personal blog) it should at least make sense. </p><p>Try to provide useful and important information for your readers, no matter what subject your blog is about if you can give the viewers the information they want or find helpful they will keep coming back for more. </p><p>You don’t need to use every technical gadget you come across on your blog; while they all have their individual places a business blog for example may lose some of its professionalism if the readers are subjected to heavy metal music the minute they open the page. </p><p>While you are working on your readership base, and trying to gain readers, you are going to find that commenting on blogs that are relevant to yours will surely help. Find a blog that is on the same topic to yours, or close to it and leave comments. You can also make a track back with your blog postings to comment on your own blog. Doing so will probably more than likely give someone else the urge to track back to your blog. This will be good for it as well. Commenting on blogs that get many comments will make your blog seen by those involved in that market. You will gain traffic and readers that way, and it is easy as well as free.</p><p>Make your blog as interactive as possible; give your readers the chance to leave comments or feedback, the more reason you can give them to interact with you the more often they will come back; on that note you can also give your viewers the chance to subscribe to your blog so they receive emails when your blog has been updated etc. </p><p>Finally, where possible, keep your individual posts in related categories etc. that makes it a lot easier for first time and casual readers to find what it is they may be looking for. </p>http://www.building-blog-empire.com</p>http://www.blogging.infozabout.com</p>Remember though, whether it is business or personal, blogs can be great fun and a great way to express your thoughts, get your creative juices flowing or promote your online or offline work.</p>
