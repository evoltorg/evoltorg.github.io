Dr. Mani Menon:-</p><p>                         Dr. Mani Menon is one of the foremost urologists in the united states (U.S). Dr. Menon (born July 09,1948), in Trichur , India, is an American surgeon and the director of Vattikuti Urology Institute at the Henry Ford. He graduated from JIPMER Pondicherry and did his residency in urology at the Brady Urological Institute at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland , USA with Dr.Walsh,          Dr. Menon developed a technique to measure androgen receptors in the human prostate , the first such measurement . Later he moved to Washington university in St. Louis , where he quickly established himself as a surgeon -Scientist , performing complex reconstructive surgery , while establishing his own research laboratories .</p><p> 		The techniques involved in nerve-sparing , radical prostatectomy were being developed by Dr. Walsh when Dr. Menon was at  Johns Hopkins .This enabled him to become one of the first surgeons in the world to perform this delicate operation. </p><p>		At the age of 34, he became the youngest chairman of urology in the U.S.A.  In 1997 , Dr. Menon was recruited to Henry Ford Hospital to invigorate the prostate cancer programs there. At Henry Ford Hospital , Dr. Menon and his team developed techniques for robotic surgery in general and robotic prostatectomy . The operation was redesigned to take advantage of the features of the robot.</p><p>		The robotic approach that Dr. Menon has developed , Vattikuti Institute Prostatectomy or VIP , has become the gold standard for the surgical treatment of prostate  cancer . </p>Dr. Menon has published more than 250 papers , primarily in the field of robotic surgery , renal transplantation and urolithiasis Dr. Menon is profiled in the best doctors of America and the International Who's Who in biology and Medicine .He has been a visiting professor at various institutions not only inside the USA, but also all across the globe , where he has lectured and performed </p>robotic surgery .</p><p>		In 2008, the president of India awarded him the B.C.Roy National award for Eminence in medicine recognizing his key role in developing the field of robotic surgery.</p><p>		Dr. Menon's early interest were in reconstructive surgery for complex renal stones, while his search interests were in cell-crystal interactions as they relate to renal stones.</p>		At Henry Ford Hospital,  Dr. Menon and his team developed techniques for robotic surgery in general prostatectomy .The robotic that Menon has developed, Vattikuti Institute Prostatectomy or VIP, has become the gold standard for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer.</p><p></p>Clinical and Special Medical Interests:-</p><p>-Prostate Cancer</p>-Urologic oncology</p>-Reconstructive urology</p>-Laparascopic prostatectomy.</p><p></p><p>AWARDS AND HONORS:-</p><p>Castle-Connolly's Best Doctors in America</p>Hour Magazine's Top Docs</p>Crains Detroit – American Dreamers</p>Top Indian Doctors in America – Little India Magazine</p>International Who's Who in Biology and Medicine</p>Gold Cystoscope Award-American Urology Association </p>Shusruta Award Of  Distinction in Urology – Indian American Urological Association.</p>Marquis' Who's Who in America</p>Marquis' Who's Who in the World.</p><p></p>RECENT PUBLICATIONS:-</p><p>Cancer Control and the preservation of neurovascular tissue : how to meet competing goals during robotic radical prostatectomy, British Journal of Urology International,  April 2008.Optimizing robotic renal surgery : The lateral camera port placement technique and current results: Journal of Endourology , March 2008 Evolution of robotic prostatectomy : Assessment after 2766 procedure , Cancer , November 2007</p>Concurrent upper and lower urinary tract robotic surgery: Strategies for success, British Journal of Urology, November  2007</p><p>LOCATIONS:-</p><p>Vattikuti Urology Institute</p>Henry Ford Hospital</p>2799 West Grand Blvd.</p>Detroit MI 48202</p>1-888-881-1117</p><p>New York University Medical Center</p>150 East 32nd  St. New York, NY 10016</p>1-646-744-1519.
