Everybody has a different reason for wanting to earn an income from home. For some of us, it’s the freedom of not having to answer to a boss. For others, it’s to make some for me it was because I lost my job and didn’t see any other way around the problem. But whatever your reason is, there’s still that one nagging question that a lot of home business owners don’t want to ask them because they’re afraid of the answer they’re going to get. Are you prepared to run a business? I’ll be the first to admit, I didn’t have a clue what was involved in running a home based business. I figured you just had to throw up a web site and the customers would come flocking by the thousands. I quickly learned that it’s not quite that easy. </p>There’s a lot of work involved, including advertising, customer service and so on. Some of the days can be very long. But it’s more than just the actual work involved. There’s the discipline factor that a lot of people don’t even give a second thought. See, when you’re working for a boss, you’re being told what to do every minute of every day. You don’t have to think about what has to be done. Every decision is made for you. But when you’re running your own business, you have to force yourself to get up every morning and make your way to that computer. Nobody is going to make your schedule for you. You’re going to have to do that on your own. You’re going to have to make sure that the advertising gets done; that the product creation gets done; that the customer support emails get answered. In other words, you have to motivate yourself all on your own. Not everybody can do that. </p>And then there are things like finances and paying taxes. You need to make a budget and stick to it. You need to track what you’re spending and what you’re taking in. You need to keep accurate records for the government. You can’t just claim your business as a hobby unless it actually qualifies as one. And you won’t know that unless you research the laws. Yes, you need to understand some basics business tax law. If you don’t, you’ll need to hire yourself a good accountant…especially if the money starts pouring in. And the above items only scratch the surface. Point is, running a home based business takes a lot of work and discipline. And not everybody is cut out for it. So, are you prepared to run a business? It might help to know the answer to that question BEFORE you start.</p><a href="http://www.product-creation-innovation.com">www.product-creation-innovation.com </a></p>	</p><a href="http://www.product-creation-secrets.com">www.product-creation-secrets.com </a></p>
