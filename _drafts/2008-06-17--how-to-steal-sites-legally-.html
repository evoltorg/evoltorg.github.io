"HOW TO STEAL SITES, LEGALLY..."</p>(What the Gurus Do To Make Money Fast.)</p><p>It's The Biggest "Inside Job" In Internet Marketing History -</p>And Your Good Buddy Sal, The Site Stealer, Is Gonna</p>Personally Vouch For You - Ayy, FuggedAboutIt ... You're In!</p><p>Ayy -- How you's doin'?,</p><p>Now before you's guys get your panties in a bunch wonderin' who "Sal the Site Stealer" really is - or if I'm a real person - or who created dis here site -- AYYY FUGGEDABOUTIT - I'm just a character that a very well-known internet marketer dreamed up to make a point. He's not pretending to hide behind the character, nobody's gonna be mad at him, and this is all perfectly legal. Da guy's name is Harris Fellman and like I said, he created "Sal" to make a very important point:</p><p>"The Fastest Way To Make Money Online Is</p>To Steal Sites That Are Already Successful."</p><p>Let's go ahead and drop the character and talk to you one-on-one for the rest of this page. My name is Harris Fellman - I've shot up to become a well known internet marketer in just the last 18 months. And I'm always on the hunt to figure out the 'short cut' to success. Site "Stealing" is point-blank the short cut to the short cut and the fastest way that I've seen yet to make money online.</p><p>I call it "Site Stealing" because straight-up that's what it is. And now that I'm on the 'inside' of what many would perceive as 'guru inner circles', I know for a fact that just about all of the successful and super-successful internet marketing guys out there participate in this in one way shape or form. They steal parts of sites, they steal entire sites, sites are stolen from them - and nobody's getting angry with anyone else over it. Nobody's gettin' "whacked" as Sal would say. Everybody's happy - in fact, it's encouraged.</p><p>Alright, look - The truth is that what you have your hands on right now is one of internet marketing's dirty little secrets - but when the gurus need money fast - many of them just go out and "steal" a site from someone else. They may throw information at you about this or that - but they all know that this is the fastest way to make money online - and now it's time for YOU to find out how to do it, too...</p><p>I have uncovered the 5 different levels</p>of Site Stealin' and I'm gonna share them all with you right now. . .</p>	Level 1: The Easy Grab - More than 50% of your online business depends on this very small thing. It's easier than you think to just grab this 'one sentence' from super-successful sites, make a few changes, and BADA BING - BADA BOOM - you're in business! I even give you the 'lock pick' and show you how to 'pick the lock' in a matter of minutes</p>	Level 2: The Swipe and Run - Alright, forget just the one sentence - take the whole page! The site's making money, right? So why not take the most important page in the entire process, have it retrofitted for your own purposed and ... HELLO!!! You're done!</p>	Level 3: Knock Over the Whole Store - This one's a little bit more dangerous than the other two. But I'll show you how to just steal the entire store right out from under their noses. Just like my ol' Wayne Huizenga did over at Blockbuster Video - he looked at McDonald's and said "AYYY - FUGGEDABOUTIT - I'm gonna do the same thing with movie rentals"! But here's the truth: It's easier than ever to do this online.</p>	Level 4: Make 'em Give You The Keys - No strong-arming here. Nothing illegal. But this really is the best deal on the planet! Picture this - a site that's already converting like crazy, making the guy a few hundred bucks a day or more, and then you come along and say "well, well, well - lookie here" - and grab the whole thing for yourself!! (And no, I'm not talking about affiliate marketing, here, you get the entire site - 100% of the sale goes to you. As Sal would say "Fuggedabout it!")</p>	Level 5: Turn the Tables - This is where you become the boss yourself and let people think 'steal' from you - in the meantime - you get a piece of all the action. You can't just jump straight into this though - need to get the respect from the family first.</p>	BONUS!!! Viral Level 5: This is it! This is how you turn the tables, become the boss yourself, and keep getting paid for months and months after the initial day you release your site. If "Viral Level 5" doesn't completely blow you away, then pull the plug right away and get your money back now. You must be making all the money you need.</p><p>You'll be given all the details plus all the tools to do all of these different levels. You even get step-by-step videos that even a total newcomer can watch and figure out how to start "stealing" sites right away. (Now, look, if you are a total newcomer -  please don't expect to be making money in just 3 days - it may take you a week or so because you've got a bit of a learning curve and you'll need to catch up. But the guys who've set stuff up before could literally be making their first thousand bucks as quick as tomorrow. I usually make $5-10k in my first 2 days, but there's no doubt about it, I'm a special case - your results will vary. Guaranteed.)</p><p>There's No Reason That You Shouldn't Be Making At Least $10,000 This Month By "Stealing" Sites. And If You're Not Already Makin' That Kinda Money? What Are You Waiting For. . . Even THAT Is Chump Change !</p><p>Visit this site for more details..</p><a href="http://sitesteal.t35.com">thesitesteal</a></p><p></p>>>>>>
