If you have decided on designing your website, then there are a few important things you need to keep in mind to avoid making costly mistakes. </p><p>The ultimate outcome should be a great website that will showcase your business venture in a positive light. One of the first questions that you should ask is: What goal or result you want to achieve through your website. In this competitive market, it's not right to design a website just because everyone else seems to have a website. For more details go to www.thedesignbuild.com .Once you're done with your plan you'll know what you want to achieve with your website and when you've reach that goal. If you have a newly launched Internet Marketing Consultancy business, then generating awareness to attract more customers to your website through an aggressive designing policy should be your motto. Your clients should be able to easily get valuable information about your Marketing Services which will encourage them to visit your website. </p><p>On the other hand, you should also think about your target audience. Find out if you need to target it towards consumers, small businesses or medium-size organizations. You should also plan a professional and progressive layout for your website. The average visitors now expect a lot of logical navigation and relevant information regarding the various services that you offer. </p><p>The next step involved in designing your website is to structure your site correctly. By now you should be concentrating on the promotion of the exciting services that your business offers. When you're trying to market your services whether its copy writing, preparation of sales literature, product marketing, advertising, PR or other services, make sure to put the links related to them directly on your website's homepage. </p><p>'First impression is the last impression' </p><p>From the perspective of the website structure, try to visibly separate additional company and legal stuff from your services. Your website should cater to the clients and not YOU. Moreover, you should separate company information from products and services. This should be implemented through two types of commonly used navigation scroll bars: horizontal for links to company pages (about us, contact, legal etc.), and vertical for the major services. This is just one type of navigation; there are several others that will work fine. Finally, there should be a good byline that summarizes your core business activities in few words and a footer that should be displayed on all web pages, because it gives the sign off note to the website. This can be your USP - Unique Selling Position which will help you differentiate yourself and stand out in your market. </p><a href="http://www.handy-color-schemer.com">www.handy-color-schemer.com</a></p><p><a href="http://www.impacts-audio.com">www.impacts-audio.com</a></p><p></p>An accurately designed website creates the first online impression for your visitors. Therefore, you should do some qualitative research - involving your competitors - what works, what does not work and what your site aims for, before you start designing your website.</p><p>
