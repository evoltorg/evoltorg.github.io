<p>Following the quality model of the Dutch Web Guidelines is a Really Good Idea, but how do you sell it to your clients? Here is one hook: they make websites rank better in search engines.</p></p><!--break--></p><p>For those of you who are not familiar with the Dutch Web Guidelines: it is a set of 125 principles to follow in order to create a good website. This quality model is mandatory for all government websites in the Netherlands. They are designed however, to be applicable to ALL WEBSITES. Using web standards is only one of the 125 principles. The other 124 cover not only technology, but also, among others: production philosophy, permanent and unique urls, open standards, page structure, images and alternative text, links and navigation, use of colour, tables, frames, forms, client-side script and DOM, languages, character encoding, optimisation for search engines. The general benefits of the Guidelines are better reachability, better findability, better usability, increase in speed, lower costs for maintenance and hosting, and making the site well prepared for mobile phones and PDA devices. It's plain, simple, and thorough: Just Very Good Stuff!</p></p><p>This article however, is not meant to convince <i>you</i> to follow these principles; it is meant to convince your <i>clients</i>.</p></p><p></p><h2>Selling the way you work</h2></p><p>So how do you communicate this with clients? My point of departure is simple: clients want to earn money. That is why it's good to know that the Dutch Web Guidelines offer a solid foundation for Search Engine Optimization: that should interest 99% of all clients. You may simply tell them:</p></p><p><i>I do not only create an accessible, valid, fast, maintainable, and usable website, it also <b>create a solid foundation for ranking high in search engines</b>, therefore delivering more relevant visitors who will buy stuff at your site'.</i></p></p><p>Jackpot.</p></p><p>Dollarsigns appear in the eyes of your client, they sign your offer and you can buy drinks for all your friends at the local pub that evening... No, seriously, cutting costs by doing technical stuff your clients probably don't want to know about is harder to sell than saying that Google will like their website better. Life is unfair, I know, but that's the way it is. So now you talk the talk, but do you walk the walk? Do you know WHY the guidelines will help you to form a solid basis for SEO? I'll tell you why, just keep reading :)</p></p><p></p><h2>The guidelines and search engine optimization</h2></p><p>The guidelines as a whole form a solid foundation for search engine optimization. One chapter of the Guidelines is specifically dedicated to SEO. In it, you see some principles, such as 'do not use (i)frames', 'create friendly urls', 'make url's unique', etc. The nine guidelines stated within this chapter are not rocket science, and they shouldn't be. They are webdesign (and SEO) basics. Other prerequisites are found in the rest of the guidelines, you can even test some of them with their <a title="tool to check website with the 125 Dutch web guidelines" href="http://webrichtlijnen.overheid.nl/english/test/">nifty tool</a>. In fact, SEO has a lot to do with Just Good Webdesign!</p></p><p>The general idea however, is that a good website only wins half the battle. The other half is <b>letting the world know about it</b>, which is the domain of <a title="European Online Marketing firm that likes the Dutch Guidelines" href="http://www.onetomarket.com/">SEO and online marketing experts</a> like me ;). So, which SEO conditions are met in the guidelines as a whole? I've studied the guidelines and found a couple of principles that underlie it. I will explain them by example and say something about the relationship with optimizing a website for search engines.</p></p><p></p><h2>Validation and 'markup to content ratio'</h2></p><p>Websites that validate according to the W3C or HTMLtidy are better read by search engine spiders. Please note that this - unfortunately - says NOTHING about the way the contents of that page are appreciated and ranked; only that the search engine can read and understand it better. In this light, we talk about something called 'markup to content ratio'. See it in action here:</p></p><p>Example 1: code to content ratio: WRONG</p></p><code><div class="header1" style="background:#eee;color:#000;"></p><span style="font-size:16px;color:#000;text-decoration:none;</p>font-weight:bold;">Dutch Web Guidelines</script></div></span></code></p><p><br />Example 2: code to content ratio: RIGHT</p></p><code></p><h1>Dutch Web Guidelines</h1></p></code></p><p><br />Take a guess: which one of these codes will a search engine appreciate better when someone searches for 'Dutch Web Guidelines'? Which one will a search engine UNDERSTAND better? Right, thought so.</p></p><p></p><h2>Linkability</h2></p><p>Which url is easier to link to and says more about the content that can be found on that page. Which URL is probably the 'main' version of the webpage? Also, which URL will search engines probably trust more:</p></p><p>Example 3: NOT linkable url</p></p><code>http://www.somewebsite.com/?page=some-url.html&amp;userlang=04&amp;so=40</p>&amp;sourcenid=&amp;siteid=IHOM&amp;clientid=20071018115757-</p>82.93.214.4&amp;partnerid=400128&amp;partneridzu=&amp;ihnav=Y</p>&amp;catsrch=Y&amp;bskt=Y&amp;rqst=Y&amp;comtype=N&amp;</p>priceso=40&amp;regioncode=33&amp;countrycode=F</code></p><p><br />Example 4: linkable url</p></p><code></p>http://www.somewebsite.com/some-url.html</p></code></p><p><br />Linkability applies to several SEO-basics:</p></p><ul></p>  <li>every webpage should be reachable by only ONE url. This addresses a problem we call 'duplicate content'. When one webpage gets indexed through several URLs, the attention of the search engines is scattered/divided. That means wasting potential rankings for one URL</li></p>  <li>a URL should not only be human-readable, but also contain the right keywords. It makes it easier to link to, to type it in the address bar, to remember, etc. When it contains the proper keywords, it is more usable and search engines might just think that the subject of the page is about the words in the URL (am I being ironic now? :))</li></p></ul></p><p></p><h2>Spiderability and Semantics</h2></p><p>Examples 1 and 2 also offer some insight into the way a search engine looks at spiderability and semantics. It is MUCH easier for a spider to understand that the content in example 2 is about 'Dutch web Guidelines' because there is way less clutter, wrong code, javascript, etc. literally standing in the way. Also, in example 2, the text is embedded within &lt;h1&gt; tags, which give it some extra weight. Much more weight than a (wrongly closed) &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; could do.</p></p><p></p><h2>Some Further Reading</h2></p><ul></p>  <li>SEO chapter: <a title="SEO chapter within English version of Dutch Web Guidelines" href="http://webrichtlijnen.overheid.nl/english/guidelines/objectives/per-chapter/#search-engine-optimisation">http://webrichtlijnen.overheid.nl/english/guidelines/objectives/per-chapter/#search-engine-optimisation</a></li></p>  <li>General: <a title="General page of Dutch Wen Guidelines in English" href="http://www.webrichtlijnen.nl/english/">http://www.webrichtlijnen.nl/english/</a></li></p>  <li>Nifty tool: <a title="Tool to check if a website conforms to many of the guidelines" href="http://webrichtlijnen.overheid.nl/english/test/">http://webrichtlijnen.overheid.nl/english/test/</a></li></p>  <li>Quirksmode discussion: <a title="Quirksmode.org about the Dutch Guidelines" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2007/01/new_dutch_acces.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2007/01/new_dutch_acces.html</a></li></p>  <li>456Berea st. discussion: <a title="456berea st. discussion about the Dutch Guidelines" href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200702/the_dutch_accessibility_law_is_awesome/">http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200702/the_dutch_accessibility_law_is_awesome/</a></li></p></ul></p><p></p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>Following the 125 guidelines while building a website is a Good Idea. It will create a solid foundation for search engine optimisation. Why? Because it creates lightweight code that helps search engines understand the content better ('code to content ratio'). It creates unique, human-readable and keyword-rich URLs that are easy to link to and are better trusted. And lastly, good semantics offer extra navigational 'hints' for search engines to weigh which pieces of content are more important than others (text within a &lt;h1&gt; is more important than within a &lt;p&gt;).</p>
