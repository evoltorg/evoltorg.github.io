<p>If you could ask one question that would change the world, what would you ask?</p></p><p><p>Dropping Knowledge is an exciting new non-profit organization whose goal is to create collective wisdom for social change. Through interactive media, events, and a living library, we generate debate, enable people to participate in defining and prioritizing issues, and facilitate the exchange of solutions. Dropping Knowledge celebrates multiple viewpoints and insights from some of the most thoughtful leaders of our day.</p></p><p><p>Dropping Knowledge means dropping the assumption that we know all the answers. It means questioning the conventional wisdom. It means figuring out which questions are the most important to ask, sharing answers and then challenging those answers. We call this practice of asking questions and sharing wisdom “Dropping Knowledge.”</p></p><p><p>Dropping Knowledge is an unprecedented, novel opportunity for international dialogue. On September 9, 2006, we will host the Table of Free Voices event in Berlin, Germany, where 112 visionaries from around the world will come together to build the foundation for the Dropping Knowledge archive, the living library. Our collection of collective wisdom will grow as questions arise. And this process starts today, with you.</p></p><p><p><a href="http://www.droppingknowledge.org/bin/dkbin?ml=2" target="_blank">Take 2 minutes and ask your question.</a></p>
