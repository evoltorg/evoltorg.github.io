7 times out of 10, small business owners think that they do not need to invest in getting a professional company logo design. Read why this could be a costly mistake.</p><p>You are a small business owner and you think that investing in getting a professional logo design for your company would be a waste of your limited budget. We at Logo Design Works believe that could be a costly mistake.</p><p>In this modern day and age, there are 1000s of companies in any given market. All these companies are competing to capture the attention of the target audience and gain the all important sale.</p><p>On the other side of the coin, individuals or potential customers are exposed to a bewildering array of "brand noise" day in and day out. From the time they get up in the morning, till they go to bed they come in contact with 100s of brand identities. To cope with this "brand noise", people have now evolved to effectively filter it out. This means that you need to have an identity that stands out from the rest and goes beyond just "noise".</p><p>The starting point of any core identity is a good visual image of your company in the form of your company logo. This visual image or logo is like you hand shake to the world. You might have 4 seconds to grab your potential customer's attention and your company logo is the first point of contact. It can either create a positive or a negative impression on your customer.</p><p>Investing a little now in getting a decent professional company logo design would always more than pay for itself. Ignore it and you could be kicking yourself down the line.</p><p>Jeff Marsh is a lead designer with <a href="http://www.logodesignworks.com">Logo Design</a> Works.
