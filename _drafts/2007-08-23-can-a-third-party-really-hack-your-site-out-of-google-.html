I received an email today that was very disconcerting. I wanted to </p>post it for everyone who may be concerned about their rankings on Google.  </p><p>Here is the email/article:</p><p>Here's a very interesting blog post by Dan Thies. I thought you</p>guys could learn from what happened to Brad...</p><p>"Google Proxy Hacking: How A Third Party Can Remove Your Site From</p>Google SERPs" </p><p>In June of 2006, while working to resolve some indexing issues for</p>a client, I discovered a bug in Google's algorithm that allowed 3rd</p>parties to literally hack a web page out of Google's index and</p>search results. I notified a contact at Google soon after, once I</p>managed to confirm that what we thought we were seeing was really</p>happening.</p><p>The problem still exists today, so I am making this public in the</p>hope that it will spur some action.</p><p>I have sat on this information for more than a year now. A good</p>friend has allowed his reputation to suffer, rather than disclose</p>what we knew. I continue to see web sites that are affected by this</p>issue. After giving Google more than a year to resolve the issue, I</p>have decided that the only way to spur them to action is to publish</p>what I know.</p><p>Disclaimer: What you're about to read is as accurate as it can be,</p>given the fact that I do not work at Google, and have no access to</p>inside information. It's also potentially disruptive to the organic</p>results at Google, until they fix the problem. I hope that</p>publishing this information is for the greater good, but I can't</p>control what others do with it, or how Google responds.</p><p>I am also not the only person who knows about this hack.</p><p>    * Alan Perkins (who along with many others stayed quiet about</p>the 302 redirect bug for 2 years) knew about it the day after I</p>found it.</p><p>    * Danny Sullivan has known nearly as long, and I suspect that</p>his behind the scenes efforts are the reason why the major search</p>engines all decided to publish "how to validate our spider"</p>instructions after SES San Jose last year.</p><p>    * Bill Atchison knows, because he helped me figure out a</p>defensive strategy for my client's sites... and along with me danced</p>around this issue on the "Bot Obedience" panel at SES last year -</p>trying to warn people without telling them too much.</p><p>    * My (now former) client Brad Fallon knows... and he's been</p>subjected to a lot of unfair criticism that he could have easily</p>answered by making this public. It cost him a lot of money, and "a</p>lot of money" to Brad is a lot more than it is for most of us.</p><p>    * "Someone else" knows, because they were actively exploiting</p>this bug to knock one of Brad's sites off of Google's SERPs. I</p>suspect many other "black hats" know about it by now... because other</p>sites are being affected. I can't believe that they're all accidents.</p><p>This is going to be a long story, I'm afraid... but bear with me,</p>because you need to understand this, and how to defend yourself.</p><p>The story begins over a year ago...</p><p>My friend Brad Fallon had been having some troubles with Google,</p>and one of his web sites, My Wedding Favors. In June of 2006, after</p>exhausting all of his other options, Brad (who knows his way around</p>SEO) hired me to direct his search marketing efforts and, in simple</p>terms "figure out what the hell is going on with Google."</p><p>The first thing I discovered was that he wasn't "banned," but that</p>Google was indexing everything on his site except for the home</p>page. It took about two weeks of research and testing before I</p>developed a working theory. When we searched Google for phrases</p>that should have been completely unique to the My Wedding Favors</p>home page, we kept finding a particular kind of duplicate content:</p>proxies.</p><p>For those who don't know what a proxy is, it's a web server that's</p>set up to deliver the content from other web sites. Among other</p>things, proxies have been set up to allow people to surf the</p>internet "anonymously," since the requests come from the proxy</p>server's IP address and not their own. Some of them are set up to</p>allow people to get to content that is blocked by firewalls and URL</p>blocking on corporate, educational, and other networks...</p><p>There's more.</p><p>Click this link to read the rest of the story...</p><p>http://www.seofaststart.com/blog/google-proxy-hacking</p>
