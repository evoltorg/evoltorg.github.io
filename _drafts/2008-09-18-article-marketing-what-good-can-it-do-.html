When mentioning article marketing there are still many people who laugh and shake there head. Typical comments from these people are often "whet good can one article do"? You know, that person is actually very right when asking this question in a laughing matter because one article in itself will not do much good at all. Many articles on the other hand can move mountains. </p><p>Well, it might not move mountains literally but they sure can get traffic rolling to your website. How I found out about the power of article marketing was really not planned rather I had run out of money trying everybody's magic formula on how to drive traffic to my site. Needles to say I came to learn about article marketing as a last desperate attempt in making my website take of.</p><p>Sitting there with no money left, a website I had worked so hard to put together and a vision of it all come tumbling down made me realize I had to take some drastic measures. That was when I came across some articles about the power of article marketing and the best of all this wouldn't have to cost me any money. You know what I did, went straight to my computer and started writing.</p><p>Having never written an article before I must confess it took some trial and error before I finally got it right. From that day on I wrote several articles a day and submitted them to as many directories as I could possible find that did not charge me anything to submit my articles. Yes, I did do a lot of work and wrote a heck of a lot of articles but it didn't take very long before I started noticing traffic coming to my site.</p><p>If you for one minute think that I started slowing down on my article writing when seeing the traffic increasing, you are wrong. Seeing the results from what I had done just made me even more exited so I kept on writing. After a while I did slow down and wrote maybe 3 or 4 articles a week which seemed to keep a steady flow of traffic to my site. Now, over a year later, my site has gotten to the point where I really do not need to do much marketing for it at all but that is only because of the type of website this is.</p><p>Most people considering getting into article marketing need to realize that any type of marketing needs to be done on a consistent basis in order to keep the traffic coming. Out of all the different types of internet marketing strategies I have tried out so far, none has worked as good and been as effective as article marketing.</p>
