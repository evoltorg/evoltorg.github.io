<a href="http://www.syntacticsinc.com">Web Development</a> entails complicated and complex details, and before you could create a website; concepts, contents, maintenance, design should be well-thought of and well-planned. You have to have a proactive relationship and collaborate with your web developers, so that there would be no miscommunication and the concepts and designs will be as you specified. However what involves web development? Before anything else, web development is essential for those who want to be seen and heard all over the world particularly for businesses, because having a website would enable you to reach those customers without delays, and be available for 24 hours and seven days a week. The possibilities of the profits that you could gain just by having a web site are limitless. However, creating, updating and maintaining a website is not a walk in the park. For a simple web site it could be developed and maintained by a single individual, most businesses especially a large scale corporation however would prefer a reliable and credible web development team because creating and maintaining a website needs a group of people that are reliable, knowledgeable and proactive as well, and the advantage of a web development team over a single developer is that there would be no hassles and worries on  your end if one of the team member is absent because it will be their responsibility and should be remedied as soon as they could.<br></p><p><br> </br>The number of members of a development team would depend on the extent and scope of the web development. A small scale web development team should have a web developer who is also known as the webmaster, he or she should have an above average skill with HTML and other tools that could be used for the web development. The web developer could also be the web designer but if there is a resident web designer then much better. There should also be a web analyst; he or she would serve as the project manager only if the project is not that sizable. However, if the project has a large scope and is extensive then there should be a project manager, web developer, web designer, two or more web analyst, application developer, and a system administrator. The project manager is the overseer of the project and team members. He or she is the representative of the team and is responsible not only for the project but also for the well being of his or her team. The Project manager also serves as the link between the web development team and the client. The project manager should have excellent intrapersonal and interpersonal skills, an above average verbal and written communication skills, have a technical knowledge regarding web development. Meanwhile, the web developer is the bridge between the project and the project manager. He or she should have an excellent knowledge of HTML and other related tools. Then the web designer’s task would be for the graphic designs, the presentation of images, colour schemes (if it was not specified by the client) for the website. Creativity and an extensive knowledge of multimedia tools like adobe Photoshop is a must. For the quality analysis of the web site, web analysts are the people for that. They will be the one to check if the client’s specifications have been met. Another important member is the web application developer. This web development member should have the expanse knowledge of JavaScript, AJAX, CSS, ColdFusion, for he or she is responsible for the functionality of the server side. The system administrator’s assignation then is for the maintenance and security of the web, servers for application and database.<br>           </p><p><br> </br>As I have mentioned earlier web development is not easy, so if you want your website to be marketable for the sake of your business then it is better to entrust it to the people who makes web development a walk in the park.</p>
