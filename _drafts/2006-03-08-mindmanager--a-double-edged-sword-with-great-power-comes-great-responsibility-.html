excerpt: "Ever since I began analyzing Super heroes when I was just a  punk kid, I knew I was right."
---
<p>I love watching UFC. Especially when both fighters start  getting into it and ripping each other&rsquo;s heads off. (The author shudders)  However, the best part of the fight is not the actual fight itself, but the  time leading up to the fight. The showdowns, news, reviews, hype, and  trash-talking&hellip;MAN&hellip;I love it. Fans start placing bets, commentators are  exchanging notes, products and services are advertised, people start buying the  channels and we are completely on the edge of a good time with anticipation,  hopes and stress.<br /></p>  For those of us who aren&rsquo;t in the UFC but love to watch, we  analyze the hell out of the fighters. Who&rsquo;s bigger, who's badder, and who&rsquo;s  fighting who? As men, we argue our points till were blue in the face. For me,  I&rsquo;m always right. Ever since I began analyzing Super heroes when I was just a  punk kid, I knew I was right. For days on end my friends and I would argue and  scream our little hearts out about who could be who. The classics- Superman vs.  Hulk, Batman vs. Daredevil, Wolverine vs. Sabertooth and my personal favorite,  Predator vs. Aliens. Now we all know that Superman would beat Hulk, Batman  would beat Daredevil, Wolverine would beat Sabertooth and that Predators would  ultimately destroy the Aliens. (Those mindless appetite driven things&hellip;.poor  souls) No matter the strengths and weaknesses, we all know something for sure,  there&rsquo;s a winner and a loser. But you&rsquo;ll always get those guys who say  something like &ldquo;But all Hulk has to do is throw Kryptonite at Superman and  Superman&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; Get real buddy! Where the hell is Hulk gonna find  Kryptonite?&nbsp; Kryptonite is found in one  place on the earth! Smallville! Hulk is way too stupid to figure that out.  Given with what we know based on comics, movies and television shows, Superman  would lead the fight to a remote or distant location away from his weaknesses  and away from people for fear of endangering them. The Hulk in his enraged  condition would be in a psychological state known as &lsquo;Target Fixation&rsquo;. Like a  mindless ogre he would chase Superman for the sole purpose of ripping him  apart. Now we know Superman is strong but that the Hulk&rsquo;s strength increasingly  gets stronger the more madder he gets. But Hulk also becomes more insane and  clumsy in this state. Besides, He can&rsquo;t rip Superman apart because Superman is  the Man of Steel. All Superman has to do is look at the Hulk and shoot lasers  from his eyes and smoke the Hulk to a crisp. No matter the advantages that the  Hulk has, it actually begins to work against him- and there can only be one  winner. MindManager.<br /></p>  MindManager Pro 6 from Mindjet is by far Hands-Down the best  software device for constructing information architects for the World Wide Web.  I will never forget the day I was introduced to this software. February 17 2006. <br /></p>  While at an interview with the Creative Director from dthree  (Alex De Paz), the topic of IA came up. We discussed techniques, methodologies,  workflows, taxonomies, processes and all the other buzzwords that are loosely  being thrown around these days. The position was for &lsquo;Sr. Information  Architect&rsquo;. It was my second interview with the company that day. After I left  the first interview, they called me back to meet Alex and make the same  presentation that I had made earlier on. Alex took me out for lunch and threw  the interview in the trash. We just talked. We spoke about everything from IA  to the continent of Africa. We just let loose. When the  topic of software came up, that&rsquo;s when things changed. I had read about all the  reviews and have used software like Omnigraffle, Visio, Storyspace, InDesign,  Net Diagrammer, Smartdraw blah, blah, blah, the list goes on. We discussed the  strengths and weaknesses of each ware and what made them stand apart from the  other. I then asked Alex what he uses. He smiled and said &ldquo;What do you use?&rdquo;-  turning the question around in an authoritative voice. I smiled back and said  &ldquo;Visio. What do you use?&rdquo; Alex went quite and just stared at me. After about  what seemed to be eternity, he replied &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to tell you&hellip;you might become  a Jedi.&rdquo; He had my attention. Alex continued eating. I just stared at him.  &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well what?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; After another forkful of Tai noodles with  spicy beef sauce he quietly whispered back &ldquo;With great power comes great  responsibility.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh give me a break! That&rsquo;s from the movie Spiderman!&rdquo; I  busted back. He then looked me square in the eye over his glasses and said  &ldquo;MindManager!&rdquo; &ldquo;Mindmanager?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes. MindManager!&rdquo; He went back to eating. &ldquo;Ok what's  Mindmanager?&rdquo; I demanded while trying to remember I was the one being  interviewed. Alex smiled, called the waitress over and paid the bill. The  interview was finished.<br /></p>  On the way home, the conversation kept replaying over and  over again in my head. I kept picturing Alex&rsquo;s face and his words &ldquo;With great  power comes great responsibility!&rdquo; I was very intrigued and what made it worst  was that he didn't even answer my question. Mindmanager&hellip;Mindmanager&hellip;what was  it?<br /></p>  After sending Alex a &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; email, I immediately  Googled &lsquo;Mindmanager&rsquo; I found out it&rsquo;s actually &lsquo;MindManager&rsquo; (with a capital  &lsquo;M&rsquo; in the middle.)<br /></p>  The company&rsquo;s name is Mindjet. I read the details. An  information management provider. Big Deal. There had to be more. I downloaded  the trial version and immediately took it for a test run. I was blown away.<br /></p>  Now for the big question and the big answer. Question- what  is MindManager? Answer- MindManager is the leading provider of software for  visualizing and managing information. Same description as before but with the  words &lsquo;leading&rsquo; and &lsquo;visualizing&rsquo; added in.<br /></p>  After mastering the software in 9 minutes, the light when  on. I started to construct the Death Star from Star Wars. I illustrated the  hierarchy of evil from the Emperor through Darth Vader all the way down to the  newest rookie Storm Trooper. Three weeks have passed by and I had constructed  IAs that are insanely bottomless with full definition, understanding,  attachments, relationships, structure and findability. What did I do? I used  the program. MindManager is in a league of its own. After using the &lsquo;Export to  Visio&rsquo; Feature, I damn near had a heart attack. What brilliancy! What  innovation! What management! After being in the company for almost a week, I  sat down with Alex and spoke to him about MindManager. &ldquo;I understand Alex! I  really understand&hellip;I&rsquo;m Neo from the Matrix...I&hellip;.I am a Jedi.&rdquo; Alex responded  with a smile of approval. After seeing my work in MindManager, he nodded  vigorously and pointed to the screen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about&hellip;that&rsquo;s  exactly what I'm talking about!&rdquo; <br /></p>  We went for lunch at a Sushi bar. Although I caught the revelation that  MindManager is not just software- it&rsquo;s the visual revelation of the blueprint  of actual &lsquo;Thought&rsquo;, I asked Alex why he simply just didn&rsquo;t tell me all the  features and how it worked. He responded &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my weapon&rdquo; He told me that ever  since he started leading people to this software, project managers, account  managers and designers all started to try their hand at crafting information  architecture. People started using it for other tasks in the office which is  fine, but when it came to IA everyone had an opinion. To record minutes or  structure a meeting or conduct any kind of business within your department with  MindManager is fine. The problem starts when people start constructing  architects when they have no idea what to take into consideration. Project  managers were attending meetings with laptops and constructing architects on  the fly in front of the clients. (which is what I do) But because the program  is so straight forward and encourages the user to continue branching off in any  direction, the strength of this program actually becomes its weakness. Like  Hulk getting stronger- but becoming increasingly insane. (Ha thought I was just  rambling in the beginning didn&rsquo;t you!) &nbsp;Because of its &lsquo;Fitting&rsquo; and &lsquo;Centering&rsquo;  abilities, MindManager actually gives the user the sensation of god-like  ownership. Every time I open this program I am flushed with the consciousness  of &lsquo;I am the Master of my Domain.&rdquo; This is not just a program- but rather a  canvass of the mind giving acute details to the many levels and avenues of the  brain. MindManager is a double-edged sword. I am an Information Architect. I am  the Keyholder. Leave the construction of architectural structure to the IAs,  Usability Designers, Librarians and Testers. Anyone can learn MindManager-  that&rsquo;s not what makes a Jedi. Only individuals who can stand on the outside of  logic instead of being logical can harness logic. When I construct architects,  logistics, categorizing, planning, classifying, conceptualizing, analyzing etc.,  these abilities are not something that is within my mind and being seen on a  screen. These skills are thoughts that I hold in my hand and shift around on a  monitor to reflect what I want to see&hellip;.the big picture. Because of Alex&rsquo;s  senior position and sway in the company, some departments (and even some  individuals) are completely restricted from MindManager. Those who are allowed  to use the software are completely restricted from constructing architects. You  have a suggestion? Great! Put it in the &lsquo;Suggestion Box.&rsquo;<br /></p>  In terms of this article&hellip;why have I spent more time writing  about heroes, comics, lunches and conversations then the actual program itself?  Because MindManager is a revelation. You either catch it or you don&rsquo;t. You  either see though it to the point where it doesn't even exist and it&rsquo;s just you,  your thoughts and the canvass, or, you simply click away and build stuff and say  &ldquo;This is a very good program!&rdquo; <br /></p>  Remember &ldquo;With great power comes great responsibility.&rdquo; You  have to search it out for yourself. MindManager is a double-edged sword. It&rsquo;s a  real blessing to me and others like me in the IA field.<br /></p>  My  challenge to you as the reader is this: After reading this article, go try  MindManager for yourself. I am so surprised that many IAs have not heard of  this program. After trying MindManager and only after you believe you  understand the revelation of the 'Thought Process', come back and read this  article in its entirety again. Then...and only then will you have the full  understanding of what I'm trying to convey. If I wanted to, I could explain it  all...but then it wouldn't be a revelation.<br /></p>  After lunch Alex and I went back to work. I paid the bill. </p>
