What does the word "Optimization" mean to you? Although our personal opinions may differ regarding what the term infers, knowing exactly how search engines interpret semantic relationships between words is a crucial component for improving organic website placement.</p><p>Latent semantic indexing is a process that determines the way search engines associate words. Understanding how to employ latent semantic indexing from a strategic point of view and using it in conjunction with organic long-tail search engine optimization, can provide hundreds of keywords for content, descriptions or titles for your web pages or blogs.</p><p>Instead of keyword stuffing (adding your keywords numerous times to inflate the importance of your pages) you can simply use alternative terms that describe the same concept and thereby strengthen your foothold for all related terms that fall under the umbrella of that keyword.</p><p>Essentially, within a few minutes time using Google and by adding one unique character before a term, you can strike keyword gold and find a variety of alternatives to enhance your rankings.</p><p>For example, applying keyword research for the word optimization Google highlighted the following associated words in bold on the displayed results.</p><p>The associated terms revealed through latent semantic indexing in Google for the seed word optimization were:</p><p>      analysis</p><p>      positioning</p><p>      performance</p><p>      placement</p><p>      submission</p><p>      speed</p><p>      optimizing</p><p>      optimize</p><p>The extent of the keywords you find are determined by how many search results you sift through using the numbers or arrows at the bottom of the page.</p><p>Now after identifying all of these various anchors that refer to the term optimization, you can incorporate them into a sentence and place the sentence strategically on your pages. If you start with the topic first and use this method to construct the content on your pages, you will most assuredly achieve stronger organic rankings for your keywords that you have clearly identified for that page.</p><p>For example, based on the keywords above one could compile a sentence that would rank well in search engines and augment the term “optimization”. In this example, every keyword is used in some form, but used tactfully. This is also a great way to find terms for your tags for blogs.</p><p>Example of Semantic Optimization: In order to optimize the performance of your website or blog’s position in search engines, analysis of the keywords you utilize can tremendously affect search engine placement.</p><p>Note how all the terms were used?</p><p>Using this method for developing your content is completely ethical and naturally strengthens the content and word density without resorting to spamming the engines or affecting usability for your visitors.</p><p>So what is the magical grapheme symbol we have been discussing? It is the tilde ~.</p><p>Place the tilde in front of a keyword / search term in Google then hit return, the words you see bolded in the search results determine other known indexed words that correspond to your keyword for that search engine.</p><p>In this case I used the word ~optimization to research alternative keywords.</p><p>So, the next time you get stumped with writer's block or are simply looking for alternative keywords for Google ad words, blogs, tags, titles, descriptions or content, Use the tilde before the search term and replacing the word optimization with the keyword you would like to research.
