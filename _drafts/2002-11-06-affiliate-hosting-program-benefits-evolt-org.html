In years past Marlene served as evolt.org\'s executive director and treasurer, though she\'s not much involved these days.

<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://evolt.org/help_support_evolt/">Help Support </p>  evolt.org</a> and via email on <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/index.cfm/a/listinfo">thelist</a>, </p>  a new supporter has stepped forward to help evolt.org.</p></p><p><p>When an evolt.org member </p>  chooses to host through NetWorth's affiliate hosting program, the hosting company </p>  donates 10% to evolt.org. </p></p><p><p>The information that follows describes how evolt.org and NetWorth Enterprises </p>  are affiliated, and provides more details about the hosting features.</p></p><p><p>For many years, <a href="http://www.nweinc.net/">NetWorth Enterprises, Inc.</a> </p>  has provided consulting and custom software to the mortgage banking industry, </p>  mostly for the top 10 mortgage companies. NetWorth enjoys a very good reputation </p>  in that industry, and began moving into Internet services 2-3 years ago.</p></p><p><p>Ron Dorman&#8212;a founding member of evolt.org&#8212;is the brother of NetWorth's </p>  founder. NetWorth is a re-seller for Ron's company, <a href="http://csi1st.net/">Computer </p>  Solutions &amp; Insights, Inc.</a> (CSI). CSI initially hosted evolt.org's mailing lists</p>  and now has taken over hosting and servicing of all our sites. The sites and </p>  listservs are running from the same data center where the affiliate hosting </p>  is provided.</p></p><p><p>CSI will be managing, supporting and servicing any hosting resulting from NetWorth's </p>  affiliate program (through their domain, <a href="http://ez-profits.com/">ez-profits.com</a>). </p>  Ron will be very involved in providing excellent service.</p></p><p>When affiliate hosting programs were mentioned during evolt.org's fund-raising </p>  discussions, Ron explained the idea and evolt.org's mission to his brother Randy </p>  at NetWorth. Impressed by evolt.org, NetWorth offered to provide the affiliate </p>  program, build the site to support on-line sign-ups and get things in place </p>  to provide funding for evolt.org.</p></p><p>NetWorth is providing the affiliate program under the domain &quot;<a href="http://ez-profits.com/">ez-profits.com</a>,&quot; </p>  but will eventually change the name (it will take a little time to get the security </p>  certificates reassigned to a different domain).</p></p><p><p>If you're interested in the affiliate hosting program, NetWorth and</p>CSI have built servers for Linux hosting with:</p></p><p><ul></p>  <li>CPanel web based site management software to allow each site secure management </p>    capability for name based and/or IP based hosting</li></p>  <li>email account management, forwarding, filtering, lists, and spamassassin</li></p>  <li>stats (3 packages available, capable of adding more on customer request)</li></p>  <li>sub-domain and parked domain support</li></p>  <li>web based file manager</li></p>  <li>web based management of file and directory access privileges</li></p>  <li>raw access log download</li></p>  <li>mysql database support with phpmyadmin</li></p>  <li>domain cron job set up and maintenance</li></p>  <li>3 shopping carts (Interchange and Agora - control panel install, phpShop </p>    - support staff install)</li></p>  <li>FrontPage 5 extensions</li></p>  <li>and several other site support features.</li></p></ul></p><p>They do not have any web based site management on Windows servers yet, but </p>  can host on Win 2000 servers.</p></p><p>For more information, please visit <a href="http://ez-profits.com/">ez-profits.com</a>. </p></p>
