Is your company ready to pounce on trends and shifts in your industry? When you spot those trends, will you be poised to make new connections with customers? With article marketing, you can quickly take advantage of changing market trends by simply adjusting the type of article you are writing. Adjusting to Changing Interest Your Companyâ€™s marketing focus can often take unexpected twists and turns. This is often the result of new interest from a segment of the market that you don't currently reach. When a product that was originally intended for one audience becomes a must-have idea to another, you've hit upon a unique marketing moment. This natural, organic expansion of your customer base is truly a significant market opportunity. This type of scenario often takes place with a major societal or environmental change. A service that was once used by a few suddenly becomes necessary for many. For instance, after a major flood, homeowners in other regions are suddenly more interested in purchasing flood insurance. An on-the-ball insurance company will be ready to answer their questions and concerns with well-written, informative articles on where and how to qualify for flood insurance programs.</p><p>Demand also shifts because of popular trends. Those wingtip shoes that are a staple for the executive set suddenly become cool for teenage girls after a major pop star is spotted wearing them on the red carpet. The savvy shoe company will adjust its marketing campaign and find ways to appeal to the younger generation. The Adaptive Marketing Plate beauty of article marketing, unlike traditional television and print advertising, is that marketing plans can be adjusted almost immediately. It's as simple as writing a new article. And with an unlimited subscription to an article distribution service such as Article Marketer, there is no additional cost. Let me repeat that -- no additional cost to target an entirely new market niche. By going with the ebb and flow of the market, a company is in a better position to take advantage of these unexpected marketing opportunities. This point is critical to making your company an effective trend marketing machine. Spot a trend, write an article, and capture that moment of perfect relevance. </p><p>This kind of "on the fly" marketing can fit in beautifully with your current article marketing plans. Experts recommend submitting two articles per category per week for maximum impact and greatest exposure. Keep a close ear to the heartbeat of popular trends in your particular industry, and be able to spot trends and identify potential changes at a moment's notice. If you see a new niche for your company, begin a new article marketing campaign. This plan may be used alongside or in place of your current plan, depending on the circumstances. Ideally, double your article writing efforts to cater to both groups! Always keep an open mind when it comes to your article marketing plan. The free market can be erratic and full of surprises. This is what makes owning a business so exciting! And, it's what makes article marketing such an effective, and affordable, way to keep on top of the market.For more details visit to my websites</p><a href="http://www.writing-fast-cash.com">www.writing-fast-cash.com </a>
