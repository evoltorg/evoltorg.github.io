<p>For  someone who is fairly new to web hosting, choosing the platform you  are going to use for your server can be a difficult and even  mind-boggling decision. Although there are several obscure choices  still available, the most widely used Operating Systems (OSs) are the  enterprise, or server, versions of Linux and Windows.</p></p><p>There  seems to be a limitless source of information regarding hosting, but  it seems that the waters have been muddied by many authors’  self-important personal opinions. This has resulted in some of the  issues becoming rather unclear to intermediate users. Some technology  bloggers have put quite a few hours, even years, into research on the  subject, only to conclude that it really does not matter what server  you decide to use. They claim that you should just make sure to  choose a really good web host, instead of worrying about the type of  server software they are running.</p></p><p>Are  they right? Does it matter what kind of server hosts your site? Why?  What is the difference between the two OSs, anyway?</p></p><p><strong>Cost  considerations</strong></p></p><p>Microsoft  manufactures and owns the rights to the entire Windows OS, from the  recently retired XP to various flavors of Vista. Linux, on the other  hand, is “open source” software and is usually free. What that  means is that it can be more costly to install and run a Windows  server, but this really would not affect you unless you are setting  up the server personally – and if your eyes are glued to this  article then it’s a safe assumption that you are not doing so.</p></p><p>What  this article will do for you is give you the rundown on how to make  the right decision about the web-hosting server you choose. The costs  inherent in running a server do not always affect the price of the  hosting package as you might suspect. The fact that a single Windows  server would be more costly to set up and run doesn’t apply to a  web-hosting firm that has installed several dozen or more. Getting  the Window hosting package is usually a bit more expensive than the  Linux hosting package, but not so much that you should disqualify it  on price alone.</p></p><p><strong>Make  no assumptions</strong></p></p><p>Individuals  often assume that just because their PC operates on Windows, they  should purchase a Windows hosting package. Not necessarily. Gaining  access to your web account will usually be done through FTP or a  control panel, and all servers support these methods. The most  important difference in administrative site access is that some FTP  commands are a bit different in Linux than in Windows and, of course,  the FTP programs will usually be created for only one or the other.</p></p><p>Think  about how you intend to put the server to use. Make your decision  based on those facts. The web features that will run just fine on  both platforms include PHP and the e-mail protocols, IMAP and POP. On  the other hand, using ASP, Frontpage, the .Net environment, Access,  Windows Streaming Media or other Microsoft technologies will likely  require a Windows host. Linux offers only limited support, or none at  all, when it comes to these technologies, meaning your “workaround  cost” will be quite high and may lack the features you need.</p></p><p><strong>Stability  and growth</strong></p></p><p>Different  server platforms’ reliability and stability records have been  raised in many discussions, some rather contentious. The focus of  many anti-MS rants has been that Windows is not a secure environment  and is only popular because it is the OS for the majority of  home-based PCs. As the most commonly used system, Windows has flaws  and people tend to spend a lot of time looking for them, as well as  exploiting them for harm.</p></p><p>However,  Linux may just be the most common server type out there and,  surprisingly, the success rate for hackers has been higher than  expected, although not as high as for Windows. After all is said and  done, the platforms and their security boil down to systems  administration and server company management. If security is the main  focus for you, then be sure to take the time to investigate the  company that is hosting your site. Make sure that they have a  reputation that is corroborated by other companies, not just their  own marketing materials. This way you will have fewer worries about  the server you are using.</p></p><p><strong>Too  close to call?</strong></p></p><p>When  it comes to the performance of the two servers, there is not a huge  difference. Linux has been known to perform faster than Windows on  some “cookie cutter” hosts that install Windows in its default,  “all in one” package. Linux distributors, using an open-source  application with more flexibility, can implement “extensible”  packages with greater customizability. In normal situations, the  performance of the two is comparable, but if system functionality is  most important to you, this may have an impact on your final  decision. Which direction that will send you depends on what you wish  to compare, as the OSs do have some different strengths and  weaknesses.</p></p><p>It  is arguably a better use of your time to look for a good host rather  than a good server model or OS. Linux and Windows developers are  always working on ways to improve both systems. At this point they  seem to be roughly equivalent when it comes to the security, features  and reliability expected by the average home and small business user.  This is not likely to change for some time. You must base your  decision on the factors most important to you and your business, and  in this neck-and-neck horse race, a clear winner is impossible to  call. Eventually you will just have to saddle up with one or the  other, and hit the track.</p>
