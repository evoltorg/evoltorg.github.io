  <p>There are  few things more important on the web than "usability," because the  Internet is an interactive space and not a one-way street. You want to improve  the visitor's experience, make choices simple, be pleasing to the eye and not  overuse the flashy add-on du jour. In addition, your site will tell visitors a  lot about your company just from the way it looks, loads and functions, before  they even read a single word. The importance of creating an attractive,  user-friendly website simply cannot be overstated.</p><br></p>  <p>For reasons  that are almost too numerous to list - marketing, sales, psychology, trust  building, perceived professionalism, etc. - the way your website is experienced  by users should be foremost in your mind. The following eight important  reminders will get you going in the right direction, but you're the one who  knows your customers (or should) so the finer points of personalization and  "character" are up to you.</p><br></p>  <p>1. The  importance of focus: You need to think like your visitors do. This is key to  your site's success. Your customers simply want to find what they need, make  the payment and get back to real life (jobs, family, tennis, whatever). If you  can make their lives a bit simpler and easier, they'll reward you for it. If,  on the other hand, you make their lives more complicated, they'll "surf  away" and stay away.</p> <br></p>  <p>2. The  importance of understanding the medium: You are not creating a slideshow, a  YouTube video, a TV commercial or a PowerPoint presentation. You are building a  website for commercial purposes. You need to provide easy, simple, clear  navigation on every page, since you never know how people will link to your  site and what they will see first. Visitors to your site, no matter how hard  you try, will not always go where you would like them to go, or do what you  want them to do. Remember that, and give them a few tools to move around the  site, like a sitemap and/or internal search engine.</p><br></p>  <p>3. The  importance of non-aggression: Most Internet users, especially experience ones,  like to stay in control of their movements. Research suggest that your  first-time visitors are "hunting," not "deciding," so do  not make unnecessary demands for clicking, scrolling, resizing windows or anything  else. Neither should you put up any roadblocks that will slow down their  hunting, like time-consuming "Flash and splash screens."</p><br></p>  <p>4. The  importance of reduced load times: Tied into #3 is the notion of your site's  real and perceived "speed." Carefully consider each page element and  make each one earn its place, based on functionality, not "wow"  value. Keep graphic file sizes small and do whatever else you need to do to  have a fast-loading, easy to use site.</p><br></p>  <p>5. The  importance of customer needs: Define all the kinds of people you expect to  visit your site and consider what they'll be looking for. Ensure that the  navigation design helps the greatest number of people to find the most popular  items in the least amount of time. Don't "bury" essential information  so that visitors have to dig down two or three levels to find it.</p><br></p> <p> 6. The  importance of simplicity: Flash is powerful tool, especially helpful in  demonstrating things that are difficult to describe in words, but it is so  pathetically overused that it has turned people off. It can be a huge  distraction, too, since animation and bright (moving) colors are exceptionally  hard for our eyes to ignore even when our brains want to.</p><br></p>  <p>7. The  importance of proportionality: Although Javascript is used on some sites to  display all the links to the other pages, there is really no reason to do this  when simple, straightforward, low-overhead HTML works fine. When you employ a  "new, improved" or more complex means of doing something - anything -  you have to take into account browser compatibilities, possible bugs and user  resistance. Don't use more technology than it takes to accomplish something  cleanly, clearly and consistently.</p><br></p>  <p>8. The  importance of avoiding surprises. You should use the expected, usual and  standard placements for expected, usual and standard site elements. Site  navigation is not something you want to be too creative with, as it needs to be  immediately understandable and usable. Such consistency across the World Wide  Web is actually a good thing, as it tends to make people's lives a bit easier  when they feel they are in "familiar territory." Generally speaking,  your various website components should look and work as people think they're  supposed to.</p><br></p>  <p>To borrow  from Oscar Wilde, consider also the importance of being earnest. More specifically,  you want to be seen as being earnest, meaning that you want every visitor to  understand, implicitly if possible but explicitly if necessary, that you are  doing everything possible to make their site visit a simple, straightforward  experience. "No muss, no fuss" is a great slogan to remember.</p><br></p>  <p>Therefore,  rather than get caught up in profound design metaphors or using your bandwidth  to display every possible website trick and/or treat, you should focus on  making your site into a solution for your customers. Make it easy for them to  do what they need to do and then get on with their lives. Perhaps the most  important thing you can give a site visitor, then, is respect and appreciation.</p></p><p><strong>About the  Author</strong></p></p>  <p>Gary Klingsheim is the Vice President of Moonrise Production.
