New improved thermal stability binder and innovative ultra fine magnetic particles are the unique technologies used in <a href="http://www.tape4backup.com/lto-4-tapes.php">Sony LTO4 tape</a> cartridges that boost its performance and reliability. Sony LTX800G LTO-4 tape media ensures efficient backup operations and outstanding data reliability. LTX800G ultrium tape cartridge is the 4th version of linear tape open format. The output level is stabilized and low error rate is ensured in Sony LTO4 ultrium tape as a result of the highly reliable and innovative coating process for tape surface. The advanced thin layer coating mechanism further strengthens the media of Sony LTX800G ultrium cartridge. These latest media coating technologies help the Sony LTX800G LTO4 tape to perform superior backup operations under enormous work loads.</p><p>Backward compatibility is the advantageous attribute offered by the <a href="http://www.tape4backup.com/ltx800g.php">Sony LTX-800G tape</a> media. Data from the LTO-3 data cartridges can easily be read and recorded by the Sony LTO-4 media technology. Recorded information from the LTO-2 tape cartridge can be read by LTO-4 technology but new data cannot be recorded onto the LTO2 tape media by LTO4 tape format. Sony LTX800G protects the userâ€™s investment and has more robust and efficient backup technology to satisfy the storage needs of the customers.</p><p>Hardware based encryption mechanism enables the Sony ultrium LTO-4 to offer unparalleled data protection features for the critical and valuable information. Massive 800GB information (native) can reside in a single ultrium LTX800G tape cartridge at an outstanding fast rate of 120 Mb/s, which helps it to support the data storage needs of enterprises.</p><p>Sony LTO4 LTX800G tape cartridges add another data security layer by working in conjunction with the LTO4 tape drives for supporting the 256 bit data encryption. Huge amount of information can be recorded in Sony LTX800G ultrium cartridge when it is compressed, therefore 1.6TB information can be recorded safely in Sony LTX800G data cartridge for longer time periods.</p><p>In compressed mode, the data is transferred in Sony LTO4 ultrium with speed of 240 Mb/s. Highest level of performance is ensured by the Sony LTX800G tape media in the product categories of LTO ultrium. Ultrasonically welded shell, advanced tracking stability and innovative A3MP technology, all these latest features ensure highest data level security and superior data reliability. WORM technology in LTO-4 further strengthens its data security features thus making Sony LTO 4 media format more reliable.</p><p>Exceptional performance and remarkable output levels are achieved in Sony LTO LTX800G LTO4 format by the highly precise servo control. Redundancy and fine placement control are ensured if the Sony LTO-4 tape cartridge gets damaged because dual servo tracks are utilized by the LTX800G ultrium tape technology. These servo tracks in linear tape media format are written accurately along the entire length of the tape reel and are comprised of 4 data bands.</p><p>High-quality servo signals improve the data reliability and enhance the data density of Sony LTX800G ultrium tape to ensure superior performance. Therefore the Sony LTX800G LTO-4 tape media assures error free and accurate recording every time the data is recorded onto the ultrium media.
