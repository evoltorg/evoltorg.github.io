I can show you how to get a joint venture with a successful production every time you try. </p><p>That's a pretty bold statement, isn't it? Well, I'll make a deal with you. </p><p>If I can't show you a way to get a joint venture with a successful entrepreneur every time you ask, I'll throw my computer out the window and never log onto the Internet again. </p><p>And for someone who spends as much time online as I do, that's not going to be easy. </p><p>All you have to do is ask a simple query to a specific group of online entrepreneurs who can offer you access to their customer base. There's no better way to make more money than to joint venture with someone who's already very successful and offer your </p>products and services to their existing customers. </p><p>You'll make more money. You'll be a huge success. And you'll finally get to quit your job and retire early. Sounds like fun, doesn't it? </p><p>So, what's the secret? </p><p>Joint venture with ezine/online newsletter owners. Ok, I know what you're probably thinking. You've already heard this before. But do you use this way? </p><p>It really works. I've generated traffic to my websites using this highly effective technique. All you've got to do is place an ad with an ezine </p>that accepts advertising. That's it. </p><p>Offline businesses do this all the time. They form partnerships to access each others' customer bases. </p><p>I was just at Kinko's a couple of days ago. If you don't have one in your area, Kinko's is a copy center. They have FedEx locations at their stores </p>now, so if you need to ship something, you can do it at Kinko's. </p><p>Both companies know that clients of either one often need shipping, as well as copying services on a regular basis. So why not offer everything in the </p>same store? </p><p>Ezine owners offer many different types of advertising. Sometimes, they can give you a free ad as well. If you can afford it, I recommend solo ads, where your ad is sent to the ezine owner's entire subscriber base entirely. You can get great results this way. </p><p>Make a list of all the ezines and ezine directories you can think of. If you can't afford solo ads, think about placing smaller ads or free ones in the publications. Do it consistently and you'll see results. Vary your ad copy, too, so subscribers </p>don't see the same thing over and over. </p><p>Most techniques to generate traffic online simply don't work. But ezine advertising is one that really does. So the next time you say that you just can't get a joint venture going with an established entrepreneur, place an ad in an ezine. </p><p>It works every time. Looks like I didn't have to throw my computer out the window after all.<a href="http://www.jointwebventures.com">www.jointwebventures.com</a></p><a href="http://www.jointventure.infozabout.com">www.jointventure.infozabout.com</a>
