I built a website for my sister. lindavachon.com. The first version she told me her daughter could not read on her mac. I used a fancy font. I have since changed the font but my sister still wants something fancier. I saw a list on a website builder that listed about 6 or 7 fonts that you could see on all computers. Am I missing something or do I not understand what a font is? For instance veranda,Ariel,comic sans. Are these all the same style or differant? </p><p>Please help.</p>lost in cyberspace
