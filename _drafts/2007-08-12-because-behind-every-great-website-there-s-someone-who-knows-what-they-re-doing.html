excerpt: "You've had the great idea, now you need a development team.  Here's a shopping list of who you'll need, and why you'll need them..."
---
<h2>The shopping list (in no particular order, quantities may vary depending on budget, individuals may fulfil multiple roles):</h2></p><p></p>1 x Director - often the founder, the risk taker, the big decision maker.  The frontman when success rolls in, but also the eggy faced one held ultimately responsible if it all goes wrong!</p></p></p><p></p>1 x Business developer/analyst - the MBA, the specialist, the one who knows just the guy.  Will ensure the business is heading in the right direction, and will try to persuade the Director they're crazy when venturing into new territory.</p></p></p><p></p>1 x Project manager/lead programmer - the captain, the team player.  Has management experience and knows how to get respect and motivation from the development team.  The one you can talk to when you've lost the plot.</p></p></p><p></p>1 x Systems Analyst - the requirements guy, the communicator, the middle man, the Visio expert.  Can listen to the Director spilling out the contents of their brain, capture it on paper, and turn it into something the programmers can understand.</p></p></p><p></p>1 x Programmer - the nerd, the one who answers yes/no but never maybe, but also the heart of the operation.  These guys take diagrams and turn them into web applications.</p></p></p><p></p>1 x Designer - the creative, the cool guy, casually late.  But without them, a GUI is just a sticky mess.  Often has usability, accessibility skills too, and a hell of a speach if anyone breaks the rules.</p></p></p><p></p>1 x Systems administrator - the UNIX jockey, Mr Uptime, the speed demon, the one who makes it go faster.  When the site goes down at 4am, this is the guy you want the auto-SMS notifier contacting.</p></p></p><p></p>1 x Database designer/administrator - the storage wizard, the perfectionist.  Anything more than a brochure site needs a database, and they're not so easy to design efficiently and scalably without the experience.  when they grow really big, you will need someone to distribute and maintain them around the clock.</p></p></p><p></p>1 x Marketer - The AdWord guru, the banner master, the feed creator, the viral magician, the one with a finger in every competitor's pie.  When you're ready for the big time, you let them out of their cage. </p></p></p><p></p>1 x Accountant - The number machine, the calculator, the sensible one.  trust me, the Director doesnt want to fill in tax returns all day, so you will need one, even if its on a pay-as-you-go basis!</p></p></p><p></p>There are more roles that could be mentioned such as Information Architect, Usability expert, Integration engineer etc.  But these roles can usually be fulfilled on a contractual basis.  Also, for small startups, you will almost certainly have individuals performing multiple roles (sometimes all of them!), until the project takes off and brings in some return.  Hope this helps. <ashton underscore king at hotmail dot com></p></p>
