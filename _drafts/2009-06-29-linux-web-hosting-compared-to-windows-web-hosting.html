<p><strong><a href="http://www.oneplacehostingshop.com/unix_linux_web_hosting.html">LINUX Web Hosting</a></strong> has been making the rounds of the web hosting circuit for quite some time now and that too very successfully. In fact, you will find it being the number one choice of people right now especially those who are just venturing into the online business world. Small and medium business houses who have less capital in their hands to invest are more likely to opt for<strong> LINUX Website Hosting</strong>.</p></p><p>With the rise of LINUX web hosting, there are bound to be comparison with the other most popular web hosting server i.e. Windows web hosting. Let me tell you one thing. Both of these web hosting servers although accomplished in their own right do have certain distinguishing features which make them one up over the other in a variety of fields. For example, if one goes by the scripting languages in which a website is designed. One would find that a website maintained in the PHP, MySQL and PERL format is best suited for LINUX website hosting and a website in ASP language is for <strong>Windows Web Hosting</strong>.</p></p><p>LINUX is preferred over the Windows web host server mostly for its affordability and being an open source product. It provides the highest up time and doesn&rsquo;t require frequent reboots like other operating system. Windows web hosting in comparison presents an expensive picture. It is very easy to locate <strong>Dedicated LINUX Web Hosting</strong> companies these days. You just have to access the web hosting directories and click on the relevant category and you are flooded down with such companies.</p></p><p><strong>LINUX Web Hosting</strong> provides a more secure, safer and reliable network of web host server for your website as compared to the Windows web hosting server. However, there might be some areas where <strong>LINUX Website Hosting</strong> lags behind the Windows server. It all comes down on to you. You can only decide which kind of web host server is best for your website depending upon its script, language, price, reliability and security. Only then can you make a correct decision regarding using LINUX web hosting!</p></p>
