Another big advantage is that Article Marketing can put you miles ahead of your competition, especially if you're selling resell rights products or promoting  links, two areas with the most direct competition online. By raising the profile, links to and search engine rankings for your affiliate pre-sell pages, squeeze pages or resell rights sales pages, you can start to see results not matched by any of your competition. Here's a real-world example of the power of Article Marketing: On April 23, 2008, I spent 15 minutes writing each of 3 articles - 45 minutes total. for help visit www.ezines-success.com I was careful to pick topics that are tightly targeted to the sites and products I have online, so they were on resell rights, article marketing and affiliate marketing. That's an important point about successful article marketing - the more tightly targeted your article is to your sites' target market, the better your results will be. With article marketing you're actually pre-qualifying your traffic because only those who were sufficiently interested in reading your original article will click the following link to your sites, and if the article was highly relevant then this targeted traffic arrives at your site already accepting you as an expert in the subject area and ready to see what more you have on it. </p>Back to our article marketing case study... After spending 45 minutes writing the three articles, I then fired my secret weapon - the real trick to doing article marketing quickly, efficiently and effectively. I logged into one of the most-professional article submission services online and uploaded my 3 articles A week later as I was about to start week two's article marketing activities, I logged back into the submission service to see what the situation was with the first 3 articles. How does 149 backlines in Google alone sound to you? Then you have to visit www.effective-contents.com to check the details. In just one week, the numbers were: 55 pages indexed and live in Google showing my resell rights article; 43 pages indexed and live in Google showing my Article Marketing article; and 51 pages indexed and live in Google showing my Affiliate Marketing article! </p>That's 149 more places for people to run into my name and solid info from me online, 149 more links back to my sites, each capable of attracting tightly-targeted traffic to my sales pages and affiliate marketing pre-sell pages. For one hour's work, total. That's the immediate benefit to article marketing - almost instant speeding by the search engines, and a number of new profit conduits set up aimed at your payment button or affiliate links. Assuming that was the average response rate, over the course of a year that would be about 150 articles you would write and submit, and the results would be almost 7,500 links to your sites, bogs and affiliate links - think that would help your marketing efforts? And even if you could find them, what do you think 7,500 one-way backlines to your sites would cost?</p>
