Social bookmarking is a technique for Internet users to store, organize, search, and manage bookmarks of web pages on the Internet with the help of metadata.</p>In a social bookmarking system, users save links to web pages that they want to remember and/or share. These bookmarks are usually public, and can be saved privately or shared only with specified people or groups, shared only inside certain networks, or another combination of public and private domains. The allowed people can more often than not view these bookmarks chronologically, by category or tags, or via a search engine. Many social bookmarking services provide web feeds for their lists of bookmarks, including lists organized by tags. This allows subscribers to become aware of new bookmarks as they are saved, shared, and tagged by other users.</p>It has happened many times with me that I forgot to bookmark a page and had to go back to the history button on my internet website browser to go back to it.  And then I was too busy to press the favorite button, to put it into the favorite list.  Thanks to bookmarks, I can get my favorite reads at my favorite places.</p>I am sure you heard over and over again how a great tool social bookmarks can be. To store your bookmarks online, that was original idea. But these day everybody in internet marketing and SEO seem to be using social bookmarks to get links, drive traffic to their site, promote their product etc… So submitting a page from your site to as many social bookmarks as you can is a good idea.
