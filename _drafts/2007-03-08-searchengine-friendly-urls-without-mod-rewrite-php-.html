excerpt: "How to make statical-looking URLs with PHP and .htaccess, but without the really hard to handle mod-rewrite."
---
First of all excuse me for my a little bit rusty english (i`m from germany) but i hope u will understand the facts. lets make it short and easy ... if u make a website with PHP u know this:</p><p>www.domain.com/index.php?thing=thingy</p><p>its not really enjoyable for searchengines they like much more statical URLs. k then lets give them what they want! in most cases we will work with mod-rewrite but on one hand its hard to handle and sometimes your provider don´t allow it, so what is to do?</p><p>the magic-words are "DirectoryIndex" and "FilesMatch".</p><p>in your .htaccess file u write for example:</p><p><code></p>DirectoryIndex eng.php</p></code></p><p>that says the server to use that file as index, so the server is not looking for an index.html anymore. now u need to add:</p><p><code></p>Options +Multiviews</p><FilesMatch "^eng$"></p>ForceType application/x-httpd-php</p></FilesMatch></p></code></p><p>this tell the server to search in the URL for "eng" and handle it as a PHP-File. "eng" is just an example u can use</p>any word what u want. so that means if we have the following URL:</p><p>www.domain.com/eng/thingy.html  (btw looks nice or? :-)</p><p>the server don`t search for "thingy.html" in the directory "eng", the server now</p>handle that URL as:</p><p>www.domain.com/eng.php...</p><p>k thats not bad but how can WE handle that with PHP? Nothing easier like that.</p>Add at least to your .htaccess ...</p><p><code></p>AcceptPathInfo On</p></code></p><p>... and now we are in the game! In our PHP-File (in this example with the name eng.php)</p>we get all informations we need with that:</p><p><code></p>$InfoArray = explode('/', ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']));</p></code></p><p>and now we have an array with informations like this:</p><p><code></p>$InfoArray[0] = "eng";</p>$InfoArray[1] = "thingy.html";</p></code></p><p>the first we don´t need but the second is interesting, just make a little "replace" like</p>this (the .html doesn`t matter u can name it what ever u want):</p><p><code></p>$InfoArray[1] = str_replace('.html', '', $InfoArray[1]);</p></code></p><p>now we have the information we want ... the name of the page:</p><p><code></p>$InfoArray[1] = "thingy";</p></code></p><p>and we can start working with that. we can make all kind of pages what we want and the</p>searchengines will love it and think its statical. so what it looking better?</p><p>this?</p>wwww.domain.com/index.php?thing=thingy</p><p>or this?</p>www.domain.com/eng/thingy.html</p><p>i think the searchengines give u the answer ;-)</p><p>thank u for your attantion. have a good time and enjoy your life.</p><p></p>
