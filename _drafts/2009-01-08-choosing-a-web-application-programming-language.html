<p>Among computer programming languages,  there is no single application that does all the different things, in  all the different ways, that programmers need. Because of the great  number and diversity of programming tasks, choosing a web application  programming language has become a critically important step.</p></p><p>Fortunately, there is continuing  development in the field, and today the number of capable  applications is expanding. Database-driven websites can now be built  with such varied scripting languages as PHP, ASP.NET, JSP, Perl and  Cold Fusion, which fall into two main groups – proprietary and  open-source. In the foregoing examples, all are open-source except  the proprietary Cold Fusion and ASP.NET.</p></p><p><strong>PHP pros and cons</strong></p></p><p>As an open-source application, PHP was  developed (and continues to be developed) by an active, engaged,  international community of users. This is a great example of strength  in numbers. Another strength of PHP, of course, is cost. It’s free.</p></p><p>Because it is free, open-source  software, PHP can be compiled and “tweaked” for most any  operating system. In fact, there are even pre-compiled versions  available for the majority of operating systems, both commercial and  freeware.</p></p><p>You can also relax a bit more with PHP,  as you can count on its being updated and improved more often than  other languages. In an open, collaborative and non-hierarchical  environment, suggested improvements can be adopted quickly. Again,  this is a strength that is derived from its open-source status.</p></p><p>PHP is a mature application, though  younger than Perl, for instance. However, it does have a few  weaknesses that may be minor annoyances to some, but deal-killers for  other programmers. Its lack of event-based error handling means that  your workflow may be interrupted by a sudden jump to a special  error-handling section. Finally, its lack of case sensitivity for its  function names will run afoul of many professionals’  long-established work habits.</p></p><p><strong>ASP.NET = flexibility</strong></p></p><p>ASP.NET is arguably the most flexible  of the programming tools, and “plays nice” with both scripted  languages (VBScript, Jscript, Perlscript, Python) and compiled ones  (VB, C, Cobol, Smalltalk, Lisp). This flexibility is also apparent in  the application’s compatibility with such development environments  as WebMatrix, VisualStudio.NET and Borland’s Delphi and C++  Builder.</p></p><p>On the downside, ASP.NET is a memory  hog and somewhat slower to execute than its competitors. For this  kind of application, that can be a serious weakness – on the  Internet, it may be called upon to scale to thousands of users per  second. Its memory usage can easily become problematic on your  server.</p></p><p><strong>JSP (Java Server Pages)</strong></p></p><p>JSP is an open-source scripting  language supported by Oracle, so developers can use Oracle JDeveloper  to create JSP pages. This can be accomplished without having to learn  the Java language first, relieving you of the task of writing Java  scriptlets. It is also extensible, allowing Java tag library  developers to outfit it with simple tag handlers that use a new,  simpler, cleaner tag extension Application Programming Interface  (API).</p></p><p>JSP has integrated the JavaServer Pages  Standard Tag Library (JSTL) expression language, and it now supports  functions. This greatly eases the creation and maintenance of JSP  pages.</p></p><p>The most significant disadvantage of  JSP is that there is no XML-compliant version of JSP comments,  forcing developers to use client-side, HTML/XML-style comments (or  embed Java comments). Depending, once again, on your particular  needs, this may or may not be sufficient reason to eschew the use of  JSP.</p></p><p><strong>A shiny Perl</strong></p></p><p>An open-source language that is both  mature and powerful, Perl offers web developers about every tool they  need to create dynamic web pages. Like other open-source languages,  it benefits tremendously from ongoing development, and the support  offered by its international community of users is second to none.</p></p><p>Perl is particularly good for creating  single websites quickly, cleanly and elegantly. If it has a major  identifiable weakness, it is that it may be unnecessarily  complicated. If you are not comfortable switching gears among a  variety of syntaxes, it may not be the best tool for you.</p></p><p><strong>The real ColdFusion</strong></p></p><p>Originally built by Allaire and then  purchased by Macromedia, ColdFusion is now owned by Adobe. It is very  easy to get started building websites with it, and you can deploy  powerful web applications and services with less training – and in  less time, using fewer lines of code –  than with PHP and JSP.</p></p><p>ColdFusion is now at version 8,  although many programmers are still using the various iterations of  ColdFusion MX, variously known as ColdFusion MX 6, ColdFusion MX 6.1,  ColdFusion MX 7, ColdFusion MX 7.0.1, ColdFusion MX 7.0.2, ColdFusion  7, ColdFusion 7.0.1 and ColdFusion 7.0.2. However, ColdFusion MX to  ColdFusion 8 is a valid upgrade path. In fact, upgrading to  ColdFusion 8 is supported for the two most recent previous major  releases of the program.</p></p><p>ColdFusion supports most major  databases, from Oracle and Sybase to Microsoft SQL Server and Access.  With its own markup language (CFML) and tags to connect to the  database, it is relatively easy to create forms and dynamic pages. It  also has all the benefits of CGI for today’s broadbased developers.  Its weaknesses are few, but expert users will caution that it is  probably the most difficult to maintain.</p></p><p><strong>Bottom line</strong></p></p><p>Secure and scalable web applications  are important to every business with an Internet presence (which is  every business today, isn’t it?) and can directly affect  productivity, sales, reputation and profits. If you want to develop a  web application and do not have the expertise in-house, any number of  reputable web development firms can help you determine the right  tools for your task.</p></p><p>Whether your application development  happens in-house or with outside assistance, it is important that  management understands the basics. You don’t have to become a  programmer, of course, but to make good business decisions you do  need to know what these powerful tools are all about. As long as you  learn enough to help make the appropriate decision, you can leave the  actual coding and compiling to the experts.</p></p><p><strong>About the Author</strong></p></p>Moonrise Productions is a <A HREF="http://www.moonrisedesign.com/">custom web design</A> company specializing in custom web  development and design.
