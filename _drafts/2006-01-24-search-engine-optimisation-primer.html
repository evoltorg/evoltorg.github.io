<h1>Search Engine Optimisation</h1></p><p><i>Search Engine Optimisation</i> (SEO, or Search marketing) is the process of optimising the content and structure of a web site to increase its ranking in search engines. Recently I've been exposed to a number of proven techniques, and I'll keep a note of them here.</p></p><h2>Planning</h2></p><p>The key to any SEO strategy is careful planning, and it's important that this takes place during the site design. If you spend weeks writing server-side code to output dynamic HTML with client-side javascript written on the fly, and give little thought to SEO, you may find yourself with no visitors! However, if you include search engine friendly design as part of your overall site layout, you'll find that a little effort goes a long way.</p></p><h3>Keywords</h3></p><p><p>Let's take your home page as an example. If it's a corporate site, you will likely have a number of products you want to sell, services you provide, and people you want to attract. The trick to a good keyword list is to think of what keywords you would use to search for your own site. Bear in mind that competition can be very high, so stick with 20-30 words or phrases particular to your audience. Place these, comma-separated, in a meta tag in the &lt;head&gt; section of your code.</p></p><h3>Design</h3></p><p>Bear in mind that search engine robots often index only the first few kilobytes of a web page. If you have lots of valuble content you'll want that to be in the index. Externalise CSS and Javascript, and use HTML (not javascript) links. If you're using XHTML and CSS (and why wouldn't you be?), structure the markup with the content at the top of the &lt;body&gt; section, then the navigation. That way your content is indexed first, then a handy, pared-down site map!</p></p><h3>Content</h3></p><p>Plan to add to your site regularly - search engines love new content. Your content should be keyword-rich: 4-6% of the total text should be from your keyword list. Place keywords in headers (properly marked-up using &lt;h1&gt; tags, not styled classes), bold and italic text, and towards the top of pages. Don't spam though - if it looks too obvious, it probably is.</p>  </p><p><p>Remember:</p></p><ul><li>Density - 4-6% keywords in your content</li></p><li>Placement - Keywords in marked-up headers and emphasised text</li></p><li>Position - towards the top of the page, where content is given a greater weighting</li></p></ul></p><p>Well-written, relevant content will appeal to your users, and will also encourage people to like to you - an added bonus!</p></p><h2>Implementation</h2></p><p>There are a number of things you should consider when implementing your Search marketing strategy. if you're out to sell something, you should look on SEO as part of your internet portfolio - along with Banner advertising, eMail marketing, and reciprocal linking. If that's the case, you should certainly consider Paid Search, such as Google Adwords.</p></p><p>Search Engine submission is your next step. Submit your website's URL to all the major Search Engines (start with Google, MSN, and Yahoo), using their online forms. If your site caters for a specific audience, consider submission to the Open Directory Project, too. If you're running an e-Commerce site, look at Froogle.</p></p><p><p>Next, look into some usage-tracking software. This will plug into your site's web server and track usage through your pages. Over the next few days, you'll want to look out for Search Engine robots as they index your site, then usage patters as traffic increases. Take note of what people are doing - what they read, what they use - and make the most of it when you come to add new content. Place prominent links on the home page to popular articles, and consider shifting the weight of they keyword ratio in your content.</p></p><h2>Finally</h2></p><p>Keep on top of new content. Remember the rules about keywords, and <i>stick to them</i> - they're important! Look at what your users are doing - they're teaching you a lesson about what they want. Tailor your content and the structure of your site to them, or you'll lose traffic. If something popular is hard to find, stick a great big link to it on your home page! There's nothing stopping you re-submitting your site to the major search engines every month or so, but <i>don't overdo it</i>.</p></p><p>I hope this has been helpful.
