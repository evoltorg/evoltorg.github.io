<p><em>Thanksgiving Day is coming! In the parlor, the Smiths are discussing how to make the precious <strong>Thanksgiving family reunion party </strong>nice, colorful and unforgettable? Sh…listen! What are they saying?</em><br /></p><strong>Father:</strong> Novel decorations?<br /></p></p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> Cute cookies?<br /></p></p><p><strong>Daughter,</strong> the high school student says mysteriously: Good ideas, but not best ones! What I suggest is - <strong>make DVD slideshow as background for our Thanksgiving family reunion party</strong>! <br /></p></p><p><strong>Father and Mother:</strong> wow!!!<br /></p><strong>Daughter (excitedly):</strong> Yes, make our own family DVD slideshow for<b> Thanksgiving party</b>! How happy is the moment when family members reunite together. At this moment a joyful party is what we expected so much! Novel decorations and cute cookies are good, but may not cool enough. A family DVD slideshow as the background for the party is more exciting and must be able to strike a responsive chord in everyone's hearts. <br /></p></p><strong>Father :</strong> That sounds interesting! Go on, dear!<br /></p><p><strong>Daughter (proudly):</strong> Thank you, Dad! There are two major benefits for us to use a DVD slideshow as the background of our Thanksgiving family reunion party.<br /></p>  First, it will strengthen the lifesome and warm atmosphere of family reunion. We can collect photos from Grandpa, Grandma, Uncle, Auntie, Brother, etc, and then make them a DVD movie played on our big TV. When they come to our party, they must be touched by the vivid show. Happy moment comes! Right?<br /></p></p><p><strong>Mother:</strong> uh…let me see…see….<br /></p></p><p><strong>Daughter:</strong> Mom, there is another point! We can also take this DVD slideshow as a novel and meaningful Thanksgiving gift for family members. Cookies will be eaten up; decorations will be torn out after the festival, but the DVD slideshow can be preserved for a long time and played repeatedly. Even Grandparents can easily play this slideshow on TV with DVD player when they miss us.</p><p>Family reunion is for the love between family members and friends. We can make DVD slideshow with our own photos, stories, and words. Let's imagine: happy holiday, dear family members and the precious moments! Don't you think it makes more sense?<br /></p></p><p><strong>Father: </strong>Great! That really sounds touching and exciting. But I don't know how to make such <strong>DVD slideshow</strong>. </p><br /></p> <strong>Mother:</strong> oh, genius! Dear, I can't agree with you more. I have already been touched once I think of the occasion. Well, is it hard to make such a DVD slideshow?<br /></p><br/></p>  <strong>Daughter (confidently): </strong>Dad, Mom, it's just a piece of cake! Listen to my plan. Now that we have already got PowerPoint, I intend to make full use of it to make this DVD slideshow.  Apart from PowerPoint, I just need a <a href="http://www.acoolsoft.com/powerpoint-to-dvd-overview.html#176">PowerPoint to DVD</a> burner. Only these two little applications! <br /><br /></p>First I will make the slideshow with PowerPoint. You know I'm good at this tool and also I have many <a href="http://www.acoolsoft.com/support/knowledge.html#176">PowerPoint tutorials</a> and <a href="http://www.acoolsoft.com/free-powerpoint-templates/powerpoint-templates.html#176">Thanksgiving PowerPoint templates</a> as references. The next and also the last step is to burn the PowerPoint slideshow to a DVD. I have tried some software like Acoolsoft PowerPoint to DVD burner. The conversion result is really satisfying.<br />  </p>In a word, everything is easy to do. Dad, Mom, I have said so much, while how do you think of this idea for our Thanksgiving party?<br /></p></p><p><strong>Father:</strong> Bravo! Oh, dear, that's perfect, isn't? Darling (turn to his wife), what's your opinion? ...Darling?<br /></p>  <strong>Daughter:</strong> Strange, where is Mom? ...Mom!<br /></p>  ....<br /></p> (<em>Beside the telephone in the bedroom</em>)<br /></p>"Hi, Dad, could you please send me the photos you took with my Mom in California? I …" <strong>Mom says</strong>, making the telephone call.</p>
