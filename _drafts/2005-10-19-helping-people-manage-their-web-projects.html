<p>As web professionals we've all noticed that many of the people responsible for running web projects have no background in technology or the web. People new to the web industry or who have responsibility for web projects would love to learn how to do their jobs better but there hasn't been a venue to do this in. Now there is.</p></p><p><p>I'm really proud and happy to be able to announce my first ever workshop "Managing Web Projects." I see this as my contribution in helping to formalise the web industry and to improve the general quality of work we as an industry are doing with our clients.</p></p><p><p>The workshop will be based in London, UK for one day only, 25th January 2006 hosted by me, Jason Kitcat, with guest sections by Antonio Gould (from 3form) and Andy Budd (from clear:left). Please support this event if you can as I think it's an important step on the road professionalising our industry.</p></p><p><p><a href="http://www.j-dom.org/h/f/JDOM/blog//1//?be_id=243">Blog entry explaining more</a><br /></p><a href="http://www.kitcat-workshops.com">More info, registration etc</a></p>
