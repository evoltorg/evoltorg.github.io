<p><em>In the next three articles in our  series on </em><em><strong>Using Copywriting for Better SEO and Marketing </strong></em><em>we  will look at how content increases conversions.  Each article will  focus on a different aspect of improving conversion:  stats, content  creation, and testing new content.  This first article covers the  basics of stats and analytics.</em></p><br></p><p>SEO has a crucial role in the success  of your Internet venture, but SEO by itself is not the "be all  and end all" or only factor in that success (– gasp – the  SEO said what??).  SEO is an absolute must, but increased rankings  and drawing more visitors is only the beginning…</p><br></p><p>…Now that you have people where you  want them, how do you get them to do what you want them to do?  How  do maximize conversions, turning more visitors into actions?</p><br></p><p>The plain truth is that it is not any  one thing.  What you really want to understand and analyze is how  well all the various page factors work together to create  conversions. Once you see how all the factors work independently and  interdependently, you will better see how (and what) tweaks of each  can increase your success.</p><br></p><p>There are the variables you can measure  more easily:  numbers of visitors, where they come from, where they  go, how many pages they view, how long they view each page, etc.  But  then there are the ones that can remain inscrutable and hard to  quantify:  the architecture and design of your site and pages, the  value of your graphics – and the things about your copywriting that  convince people to click through and buy.</p><br></p><p>When considering how to increase sales  from your traffic, you are generally thinking in terms of conversion  optimization. To increase conversions you must have a clear  understanding of what your site visitors are actually doing – this  you can get from statistics.  But you also need to see your site from  their perspective – this will tell you what those stats are  reflecting. Only after you view your site through the eyes of a  visitor can you fully assess what you're doing right and what you're  doing wrong.  Then you will have a clearer picture of how to increase  those conversions. </p><br></p><p><b>What to look for</b></p><br></p><p>Your stats are going to be different  than anyone else’s, just like the various challenges you face. As  you get deeper into your stats and analysis you will discover that  certain aspects are more important than others for your specific  situation. However, there are some common factors that must be  considered by every site owner/operator. A few of those universally  applicable measurements that just about everyone should be looking at  are:</p><br></p><p>Keywords: You may know how your site  ranks, but to discover what that really means and use it to your  continuing advantage you need to dig a bit deeper. Good, easy to  digest keyword stats can tell you just how much traffic specific  keyword rankings are actually producing.  This will both tell you  what keywords are the most valuable and expose opportunities for  improvement.</p><br></p><p>Visitors: Naturally you need to know  the number of unique (and repeat) visitors you get over a certain  period of time, and of course you want to increase it. Unique  visitors by itself will not directly assist you to increase  conversions, but it is valuable in showing how your rankings and  inbound links affect the amount and nature of your traffic.  Repeat  visitor statistics on the other hand <em>can</em> help increase  conversions.  For one, return visitors may be returning to buy from  you, so their actions and how you are converting them are to be  greatly analyzed.  Secondly, sites with better content naturally  engender a greater visitor return rate due to visitors returning for  more good information.  People usually don’t just do a search and  buy from the first site they land on, they typically visit a number  of sites.  When they are ready to buy, they often return to the site  that gave them the most helpful information.  Use your content to  turn them into buyers when they come back.</p><br></p><p>Referrers: Where your traffic comes  from is also key.  How much traffic is coming from the search engines  vs. inbound links vs. ads?  Which search engines are sending you the  most? These kinds of figures have been called "word of mouse"  referrals.  Which sources convert the best for you? </p><br></p><p>Exit Pages: Few statistics are as  crucial as this, particularly as you work to increase conversions  through the understanding, and potential manipulation of, visitor  behavior. When you pin down the pages from which your visitors depart  your site, you can then address one of the most serious failings of  your site, its architecture, its design – and the copy.  Analyze  deeply and objectively – why are they leaving from this page??</p><br></p><p>You are not amassing piles of data just  to have it on file. You need to assemble what you are learning in a  way that you can then use to improve the copywriting for increased  conversions. Don't forget the aim of the whole exercise, and try to  keep the information clear, straightforward and, therefore, usable.  It's all about making each site component the most effective it can  be, and copy is among the most important ones.</p><br></p><p><b>Using the data you get</b></p><br></p><p>The stats and analytics you are  developing (on a continuing basis) need to be mined in different ways  to discover different things. Remember that the task before you right  now is to create content that will aid in conversions.  All the  analyses of keywords, traffic, visitor paths, exit pages and so forth  should find its way into your new, improved way of creating  compelling copy.</p><br></p><p>You certainly need to check your stats  regularly, though you don't need to study them daily. A weekly  review, at minimum, will be necessary to keep you abreast of what's  going on and fluctuations of where traffic is coming from, where it's  going, and whether or not your visitors are doing what you want them  to do (answering the call to action).</p><br></p><p>One of the simplest way use stats to  craft better copy for increasing conversions is comparing sites that  do both well and poorly in your own industry. While you won’t have  access to their nitty-gritty details, it is not difficult to find out  the general view of their stats and who is succeeding with  conversions, so comparing various approaches can give you some good  direction. </p><br></p><p>There are so many variables, so much to  do and keep track of, that you can easily get lost in a maze of  numbers and percentages. Remember, you are working on copywriting  now, so the first quality you want to study in a successful  conversion setting is which copywriting approaches are working and  which are not. Tone, style, presentation format, vocabulary level,  and interaction with calls to action – these are all highly  important variables, and require you actually to go and see sites to  discern them. The other data, thankfully, can be accrued using  various tools, even free ones.</p><br></p><p><b>Tools of the trade</b></p><br></p><p>Webalizer and AWstats: Your web  hosting provider most likely offers some kind of free stats/analytics  program, perhaps Webalizer, AWstats or something similar. Although  these statistics programs are somewhat elementary and lack the  in-depth information-gathering capabilities of others, they are  simple and do not require special training to use. It is either  difficult or impossible to customize the information you get and how  you see it, but if you are new to stats (the online kind or any  other) then these are a good start. The better you get, the better  tools you can begin using.</p><br></p><p>Google Analytics: Called by some "the  upgraded Urchin," this program gives you the information  collected by Google in a simple, easy-to-read format. As opposed to  some other no- and low-cost tools, Google Analytics can customize the  data presentation and allows you to establish "targets" to  track precisely who is landing on which specific pages. One possible  downside, at least at the beginning of your optimization efforts, is  that all of your own information is now displayed to Google. It may  be wise to get your site "in gear" and moving up the  rankings before you decide to share your own stats with the Google  universe. </p><br></p><p>ClickTracks: This is the favorite of a  number of analytics people because of the virtually limitless number  of ways you can customize it. With its heavyweight features, such as  the ability to calculate ROI and generate user-defined reports, it is  a solid and valuable tool. Although it is not free, it is priced  appropriately for the amount of power it affords. It would be well  worth it for anyone to take a test drive with the free, trial  version.</p><br></p><p>You may have to fight the urge to keep  digging, keep mining, and keep generating more and more stats and  reports. It can get addicting, and if you’re not careful can lead  down the path toward white lab coats and mad scientist-ism.  You have  to balance the information gathering and analysis with taking  remedial steps with the copywriting that is of core importance to  your site's business. Resist the temptation to overanalyze, and stay  focused on the task at hand. One thing no tool or program can do for  you is to create an efficient timeline for doing the work and  recasting your site's copy to increase conversions. You have to  figure that out for yourself. Just remember, these are changes that  you want to implement as soon as you can, not study to death.</p><br></p><p><b>Conclusion (and a new beginning)</b></p><br></p><p>This is the conclusion to this article  only, not the conclusion to the process in which you will be  continuously engaged for the duration of your site's life. Here we  may have covered all of 1 or 2% of what could be said about using  statistical information to refine and empower your website copy so  that it leads to more sales. Again, there are various components of  your site that will participate in this effort – architecture,  layout, graphics, etc. – but you want to make your copy do its job  by compelling your site visitors to take the actions you want them to  take.</p><br></p><p>Statistics are one essential tool,  among many, to understanding how your site functions and how to make  the most of that knowledge. Stats are, without question, key to  maximizing your ROI from your website, and thus need to be reviewed  on a continuing basis. There is a lot of help available in online  articles, user forums, and the support documents that accompany the  stats programs that you are (or will be) using. Still, if you run out  of time or patience, or feel that you are in over your head, there  are plenty of professionals, reputable and cost-effective, to help  you create good copywriting to increase your conversions from on the  stats you assemble about your site.</p><br></p><p><strong>Next  Week</strong></p><br></p><p>Next week we'll be releasing Part Four of the series: Writing For Conversions, Part 2 – Content Creation.</p><br></p><b>About The Author</b><br></p>Matt Tuens is a copywriter for Beanstalk Search Engine Optimization, Inc.
