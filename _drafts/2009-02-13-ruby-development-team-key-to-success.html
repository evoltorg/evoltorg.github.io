<h3>So, you are ready for an internet startup?</h3> </p><p><p>You have created a really good business plan during last year and half, you have found your business angels - investors, and, man, they said - ok! and gave you couple of bi.. mi.. millions. Now, you are ready to start the venture to bring your idea to life. Everything is ready. But, wait! You forgot something.</p> </p><p><h3>Where is my Development Team?</h3></p><p><p>Of course, after choosing a correct programming language, you need to find those mysterious magicians - programmers - who will transform your clear business plan into pulsating reality of servers, programs, traffic and army of customers. But then, who can tell where that development team is. A team which won't scatter because of their bold characters during the first week of collective work, a team which will give the best programming quality within the set terms and will not turn your project into one sarcastic remark in some boring blog?</p></p><p><h3>East or West...</h3></p><p><p>You can outsource a team of programmers from abroad or find them into your hometown, anyway in every case hiring a strong responsible development company - is the task. Lets imagine you have chosen the most suitable language among all programming languages, the most advanced modern platform for internet startup development - Ruby. And lets imagine you know what Agile Development is. The search of such a team of specialists - priests of programming - will be an extraordinarily hard problem.</p> </p><p><h3>Ruby rails to successful startup</h3></p><p><p>Thats clear - months of search will not give a penny. Moreover one hundred of Salieris will not create Requiem of one Mozart. Maybe you could ask your competitors - where they have found that team of development gurus? No. </p>You don't need to own ruby mountains to buy a key to successful Ruby startup. Probably, there is at least one <a href="http://railsware.com">Ruby Development Team</a> that's closer to you than it seems?</p></p><p><p>2009 Â© Railsware<br /></p><a href="http://railsware.com">Ruby On Rails Development Team</a></p>
