Till now, most people bought insurance through an agent, or called the toll-free number of the insurance company to get a quote.</p><p>However, with the increasing usage of the Internet, getting insurance quotes online is fast becoming the norm rather than the exception. There are plenty of sites out there that offer to provide you an insurance quote. Many even provide you the ability to get insurance quotes from multiple companies, and compare them to get the best deal.</p><p>However, there are relatively few sites that offer practical insights on getting a good deal on your insurance needs. There are even fewer that offer advice on what to look for when getting an insurance quote, the list of insurance agents in your locality, and what are the pros and cons of going with the company offering to insure you for the lowest premium.</p><p>You can find all this, and more at www.get-online-insurance-quote.com (or www.goniq.com for short). They offer advice on many different types of insurance like auto insurance (including car insurance), life insurance, home insurance (including flood insurance, <a href="http://www.get-online-insurance-quote.com/home/about-earthquake-insurance.jsp">earthquake insurance</a> and <a href="http://www.get-online-insurance-quote.com/home/Knowing-mobile-home-insurance.jsp">mobile home insurance</a>), health insurance, <a href="http://www.get-online-insurance-quote.com/renters/">renters insurance</a>, and <a href="http://www.get-online-insurance-quote.com/disability/">disability insurance</a>.</p>
