One of the top ways to generate money from your website is to use your EBook resale right. It is very advantageous and I hope to be doing more soon. You can:</p>Create your own products such as EBooks. Be sure to make it as professional as possible. Include great graphics with your cover, homepage, thank you page, etc. Also, attach your Ebook resale right that’s associated so that you can create passive income later. Depending on the resale right, such as full resale rights, you may be able to sell the products to your client’s customer, who must repurchase the resale right from you to sell for 100% profits and full rights to their clients, and so one. Please read my blog on the types of resale rights.</p><p>Brand your EBook to reflect yourself and make sure to include photos, name, and a great slogan to drive customers in. Something that is exciting, like: “Tear the Competition into Pieces by Using These 5 Traffic Blazing Techniques”.</p><p>While rebranding yourself, look around and research which affiliates compliment your service. You don’t need to approach other businesses that are working your own niche…its competition! </p><p>Private Label Rights are a type of EBook resale right that is not as regular as just selling EBooks. It’s a tactic that works for some and not others. You’ll be able to easily find good quality products by doing a quick search. Purchase a current and trusted Private Label Product and rebrand it. I would suggest changing most of the WebPages into your own words and sentences. Be yourself! Express yourself so that customers can relate to you. They will be impressed if you can distinguish yourself from all the other entrepreneur money-makers who are trying to do the same thing.</p><p>After branding yourself several times you will get more exposure to customers and eventually you will have a name that people will be able to trust. This may take 5 times or it could take 20, because it really depends on how you market yourself. Again, be yourself and don’t try to be a phony. You may gain short-term hype, but word travels fast when you’re spotted as a “fake”. This could result in you having to start again from scratch and hoping for the best. </p><p>There is a lot more you can learn about rebranding strategies, so I would do my homework beforehand. If you do it all correctly, you’ll be soon known as an EBook Marketing Master that can be trusted. Credibility equals Sales! </p><p>So if you’re thinking about making some good money, take a look into either creating your own products or buying private label products and rebranding them to your liking. Do this right and you’re on your way to financial freedom with your very own internet business!</p>
