More nonspecific paths should be used.</li></p><li><strong>Use lower case</strong>: All files and directory names should be written in lower case so as to avoid confusion. This may not be an easy task under Linux OR Unix systems, so it is essential to get the process correct in spite of its case related issues.</li></p><li><strong>Do not use punctuation in file names</strong> : While designing an URL it is often noticed that underscores are used. This may be difficult for users to remember. For separate file names it is suggested to use hyphens instead of underscores.</li></p><li><strong>Host and domain name typos</strong>: It is always seen that users in a hurry make mistakes while typing. There may be companies that are difficult to spell. So if the organizations find the typo domain names and add up a few entries, it will make the site more user friendly.  </li></p><li><strong>Guessable URLs</strong>: It should be possible for the users to guess the URLs for a site entry. Mapping multiple URLs to a site may make the job fairly easy and increase the usability of the site.</li></p></ul></p><p><h3>Synopsis of the Article</h3></p><p>The look of an URL is in itself an important factor that can influence its users.
