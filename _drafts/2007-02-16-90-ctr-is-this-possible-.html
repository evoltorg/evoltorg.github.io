Innovation and invention on Internet Marketing is a non-stop activity that most people who are indulged in Marketing keeps busy. Email marketing, link exchanges, safe lists, traffic exchange, banner exchange, free-for-all sites, forum advertising, article submissions, directory and search engines submissions, adsense, and other method of promotion including spamming, are just some of the traditional techniques in advertising that most marketers finds convenient to do.</p><p>The discovery of auto surfs and paid-to-read or paid-to-click ads made us believe that promotion is more convenient and efficient through these recently-discovered method. But later on, we also discovered and realized that these recent strategies are worst compared to that of traditional method.</p><p>Traffic from paid-to sites are not considered as CTR (click-through-rate) due to the nature on how it is done. Professionals and experts does not consider a traffic as serious when it is paid and/or mandatory. Thus, these type of advertising are useless and could only give bigger loss to the advertiser due to worst quality of traffic he might get.</p><p>In other words, traditional ways are still ahead. The standard CTR as the result of survey conducted by Timelyads shows that traditional advertising got an average of 0.35% to 0.91%. Adsense got the highest with a maximum of .92% if placed in forums.</p><p>Does the statistics satisfies you?</p>Me? I am not satisfied. I've thinking of more reasonable CTR and for me, 5% to 10% real and quality CTR might be fine.</p><p>My illusions ended when I discovered a new way of maximizing CTR upto 98%! Yes, 98% and not a joke. People will visit your site not because they are told to so so, not because they will be gonna paid, not because they are forced...but because they wanted it..</p><p>How?</p>Of course there are millions of websites and thousands of categories. To make sure that the advertiser will get a real targeted traffic, I created just one site and implemented this method. I tried promoting my other site and the result was really excellent. The target of 95% CTR is 100% achievable and effective.</p><p>Compared to other advertising options, selling ads per minute as others say is expensive but I don't believe. Count the clicks your banners made and compare it to the clicks you get in minute advertising. The result is still very far different.</p><p>To read the complete details of this strategy, you may visit <a href="http://www.timelyads.com">Timelyads.com FAQ</a>. Ads on this site are all e-gold related because the site accepts only e-gold...this is what target traffic find its way.
