This significant pilot was aimed at  schools adopted by Rotary Club of New Delhi.</p><br><br></p> In the last decade, the information age revolution has brought India to being considered as IT Super Power. To ensure that the benefits of this revolution reach everyone especially the students and youth from underprivileged families, CyberLearning and Rotary Club of New Delhi initiated this digital learning and certification program. </p><p> This program was conceived in October 2007 and 2 girls' schools in Delhi were selected for the pilot. Students in the selected schools pay a monthly education fee of Rupees 10/month, which is equal to 25 cents. 30 girl students were selected for the pilot of 3 months. The pilot was launched in Jan'08 and was completed in April 2008. The entire fees were subsidized for the selected group of students jointly by Rotary Club and CyberLearning Society. In the program, students were trained using eLearning from CyberLearning and at the end of the pilot, 26 out of 30 students earned the coveted Microsoft Office Certification.</p><br><br></p>This program was aimed at empowering the students from the economically challenged background and I am happy to see the results stated Rtn.
