<br><br></p>Most SEO analysts continue to use Wordtracker as their main source for keyword analysis and considering being able to have the closest match to what your target market is searching for is soo important, having the most accurate keyword analysis is critical to being able to provide the best results. Wordtracker Keyword Analysis software has been around for quite some time now and is what most SEO analyst use as their primary choice for SEO but Wordtracker has a lot of limitations.<br><br></p><p>First, Wordtracker is very slow and cumbersome. You have to go through several processes that each require an annoying wait for the information to display before you can move onto the next predetermined step.<br><br></p><p>Keyword Discovery’s process is very simple and yields more keyword information such as keyword trending, dataset selection, language translation and more. You can navigate through the software just like a website and they even offer tools that you can load onto your desktop. I personally don’t have it because of the $price…<br><br></p><p>Second, Wordtracker pulls from a very small dataset in comparison to the actual population. Their database is comprised of nearly 200 million searches over the last 90 days. Considering the actual population is probably close to 100 billion searches a month, 200 million is very small which means the margin for error is much higher than Keyword Discovery.<br><br></p><p>Keyword Discovery’s dataset is nearly 26 billion search queries collected over the past year. Because their dataset is closer to the actual population, it means there is less margin for error. It is going to be a more accurate depiction of how people are searching and will provide more variations allowing you to find the niche phrases that are going to yield the best results.<br><br></p><p>Third, the setup and process flow of the analysis limits what you can do with the data. There is a predefined process that makes you go through step 1 then to step 2 and so one which limits what control you have over the process. Keyword discovery works more like a website in which you can navigate back and forth and from project to project, and from areas of the process to other areas which allows you to completed additional trending analysis to eliminate any keywords that are seasonally out.<br><br></p><p>Fourth, If you have ever tried geographic targeting in Wordtracker you can forget about it. Because Wordtracker’s dataset is so small and only comes from 2 search engines it is very limited and often returns zero results for geographic targeting which is often a huge factor for most smaller SEO clients and even for us <a href="http://www.seoslap.com">SEO Analyst</a>.<br><br></p><p>Keyword Discovery is very good at Geographic targeting which is one of the best attributes for the software in my opinion. I have multiple clients who need to focus on their specific areas and if their competitors are using Wordtracker, I have a competitive advantage over them and can more accurately target the market.<br><br></p><p>Now that I have beat up Wordtracker enough, I do want to say that Wordtracker isn’t all bad, it did serve me well for the first couple of years and may still be a viable tool for some people that don’t need the accuracy and level of analysis that I prefer. To create the simplest analogy that most of you would understand, it’s like comparing Dreamweaver to Frontpage…</p><p>
