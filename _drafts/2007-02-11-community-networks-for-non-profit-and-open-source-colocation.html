If you host a server for an open source project, a non-profit organization or non-commercial hobbyist use, you probably qualify to have your server hosted in a community colocation facility.</p><p>For several years, there's been a growing movement of community colocation facilities in various cities around the United States & Canada. It started out with the California Community Colocation Project (now offline) and spread to <a href="http://www.seaccp.org/">Seattle</a>, <a href="http://www.chiccp.net/">Chicago</a>, <a href="http://tccp.dreaming.org/">Toronto</a> and Washington DC. The newest one that just opened is the <a href="http://www.sfccp.net/">San Francisco Community Colocation Project</a> with a colo facility in downtown SF.</p><p>There are two goals of the community network approach:</p><ol></p><li>Affordable colocation for non-commercial projects: Non-profit organizations, open source projects and even hobbyists should be able to afford to rack their server somewhere,<br /><br /></li></p><li>Protection of online free speech: The communitycolo movement works closely with groups like the EFF. In 2003, in a case that has now become famous, Diebold sent DMCA takedown orders to a bunch of people who were hosting documents that cast an embarrassing light on Diebold's electronic voting machines, including groups that hosted their servers at the community colocation project. The CCP took the case to EFF who represented us and forced Diebold to back down. A corporate colo facility probably would have complied with Diebold's lawyers and forced their client to remove the content. This case is a clear example of how community networks offer a critical protection needed in democracies. More information about the Diebold case can be <a href="http://sfccp.net/diebold.html">found here</a> and on <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/27/050218">Slashdot</a>.</li></p></ol>
