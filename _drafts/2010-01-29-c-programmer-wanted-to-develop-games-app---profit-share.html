Hi</p><p>This is as much detail as I can provide:</p><p>Competent C++ programmer wanted to develop games app for Apple Iphone. This will not be paid as it is on a profits sharing basis.  its a hack n slash arcade game overhead perspective similar to pacman but more sophisticated. My background is in animation and my brother is a playtester and is in charge of overall design. Profit share to be discussed and am open to fair suggestions. </p><p>All interested parties should email me with their gaming interests , experience with apple iphone apps at gregsie74@yahoo.com</p><p>Thanks</p><p>Greg</p><p>PS im based in London UK.</p><p>
