We never felt this good about the product. Our confidence is built on the feedback from our users, which has been simply overwhelming. We hear words like "bloody awesome", we see posts on Forum saying "Without PhpED, I wouldn't have tried to use PHP" and we know we are doing something right. We see the reviews that PhpED gets in on-line and printed media and we see how customer after customer chooses us over competition again and again for the same reasons: better quality, higher speed, better, more intuitive user interface, better, our own debugger. We are extremely dedicated and hard working team and we couldn't ask for better reward for our work. We are also very excited with new Upgrades policy introduced in 4.6. With 1 year of FREE upgrades with PhpED and 3 years of FREE upgrades with PhpED Advantage we feel much more like being on the same team with the community of PhpED users, because now we will always know that point of the first sale is only the beginning of working together with our new user on the new version."</i></p></p><p><p><h3>Introducing PhpED Standard Version 4.6</h3></p></p><p>Beginning with Version 4.6 NuSphere introduced <b>PhpED Standard</b>, less expensive version of PhpED. NuSphere designed PhpED Standard IDE for PHP developers who need PHP IDE with syntax highlighters and the full power of PhpED editor settings as well as local debugging capabilities right now, but don't need many integrated and deployment tools like Database client and FTP/SFTP or WebDav. Competitively priced at $119 PhpED is brought to the market by popular demand from our users who are new to PHP or not involved in PHP development most of their time. With the same benefits of highest speed and the most intuitive user interface and debugger PhpED Standard will be able to satisfy the needs of a very big part of PHP market.</p></p><p><a href="http://www.nusphere.com">For more information about PhpED 4.6 and for FREE trial please click here.</a></p>
