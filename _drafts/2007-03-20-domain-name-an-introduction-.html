The best known TLD remains .com but regional names are a rapidly growing area such as .co.uk's</p><p>Discount Domains is a leading UK domain name registration service and offers web hosting and web design services as well as domains.</p><p>The various chief type of domain name includes:</p><p>.gov - Government agencies</p>.edu - Educational institutions</p>.org - Organizations (nonprofit)</p>.mil - Military</p>.com - commercial business</p>.net - Network organizations</p>.ca - Canada</p>.th – Thailand</p>.in- Indian</p>.info- Information</p><p>.COM: -  The term is used for commercial purpose.

If you are acquiring a name that has the potential to cause confusion, it is generally recommended that you obtain the most logical variations This often includes non-hyphenated and hyphenated variations, along with words that are phonetically similar and common misspellings.</p><p>Richa Sinha is associated with Vexat INC.
