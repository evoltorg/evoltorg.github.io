<p>The very idea that someone could start their own business with just a few hundred dollars, or a few thousand dollars and a business prospect list to create real wealth is fantastic. Unfortunately home business do have a higher than average failure rate. The statistical rate of success is in fact well below acceptable standards. Sadly this is not due to some direct stupidity or laziness of the home business operators. Usually these people work hard at their businesses and follow the advice and MLM training they have been given by the so called “experts”. The problem is in the quality of MLM network marketing training regularly taken by many home-based business operators. The sheer volume of misinformation is heartbreaking. A remarkably stupid business prospect list suggested by some fly-by MLM try hard contributes to a great many MLM failures.</p></p><p><p>Without doubt, should  many of these failed business operators have received the appropriate MLM training and education without all useless but hype that exists in our industry the percentage of less than successful home based business would dramatically drop. This percentage would drop so significantly in fact that failed home business would be quite an unusual experience. A good business prospect list will do much to improve the success rate of MLM businesses.</p></p><p><p>One of the most common misconceptions to believe that you may simply create a list of 100 people you know, call it a business prospect list, and watch your wealth grow. This terrible line is repeated over and over again.</p></p><p><p>Most importantly this terrible advice has the potential to damage your relationships with family and friends. This is not even a business prospect list.  Business ventures and personal relationships are like oil and water, the two should never mix. At its root this is simply poor social etiquette.  But the damage that could be caused by adding your family and friends to a business prospect list may go far beyond a few embarrassing moments. Those that have tried this did not imagine it when they thought they heard their friends whisper to each other “quick, let’s run”, that really happened.  The steady declines in social invitations were not a coincidence either. Please! They might love you but they do not want to be on your business prospect list.<p></p><p><p>To professional MLM operators this is referred to as targeting a warm-market, a warm market does not translate to “business prospect list.” The potential this warm market has to destroy your relationships is frightening.<p></p><p><p>It is astounding that this marketing model exists only in network marketing from manufacturers to their consultants and distributors; nowhere else in the business would this even be remotely entertained. You might argue that MLM depends on recommendations and referrals to succeed. The truth is, so do most established business operations, no McDonalds franchise owner will ask that their staff should get their family and friends involved; neither would an Avis car rental owner offer a bonus to staff for attracting their friends to use their service. In fact successful business and good ethical business will encourage their employees to separate personal and business relationships.<p></p><p><p>So you might be wondering how you should be marketing your business, who should be on your business prospect list?<p></p><p>As a distributer you should learn to ask your lead broker the right questions, and to generate your own leads in the creation of your business prospect list. This is something that cannot be handed to you ready made.<p></p><p><p>Primarily you need to establish an objective view. This objective view will offer you perspective; the perspective will lead you to the gold, your target market full of individuals that want to be on your business prospect list. Absolutely every business in the universe must have a target market to be viable. The target market is the focus of your marketing campaign.  The target market is the audience you need to be delivering to.<p></p><p><p>Your target market will naturally depend on the product or service you are offering. The individuals that you will build your business prospect list will be folk with an interest in this niche.<p></p> </p><p>Certainly your next step is to deliver the right message to your target market ie the folk on your business prospect list. Your message must relate directly to your product or service and the benefits it provides. The benefits and your delivery should compelling and interesting enough for folk on your business prospect list to take advantage of your offer. Believe in the product or service you are offering and lead with this.<p></p><p><p>Now that you know what a business prospect list is your family and friends are once again safe.<p></p>
