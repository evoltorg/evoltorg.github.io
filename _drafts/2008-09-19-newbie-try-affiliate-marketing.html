Then the easiest and most uncomplicated way to start earning extra cash or building up a business, is by selling other peoples products, better know as Affiliate Marketing. In this article we will have a look at the various types of affiliate marketing opportunities that are available.</p><p>Over the last few years, affiliate marketing has become very popular, no longer is affiliate marketing merely thought of as an alternative method for the merchant to advertise his products, but also as a means of generating additional income for the affiliates. With the benefit of little to no start-up costs makes affiliate marketing ideal for people who want to try their hand at Internet Marketing. And has in fact become the number one provider of advertising for the merchants and the main source of income for affiliate marketers.</p><p>What you find out and ask yourself is; what type of affiliate marketing will work best for you? Are all affiliate marketing programs the same? Are the benefits the same? Or are there affiliate marketing programs that work better than the others?</p><p>There are a number of types of affiliate marketing opportunities ranging from the basic Pay Per Click marketing to the more advanced Residual Income Marketing. Lets have a look at some of the various options available in more detail.</p><p>1. Pay Per Click (PPC)</p><p>PPC is most likely the most popular method of affiliate marketing for affiliates with small websites, and probably the easiest way for them to earn money. In this affiliate marketing method, the merchant pays the affiliate whenever a visitor is directed to his site, that is whenever someone clicks through on the merchant's banner or text ads. The affiliate gets compensated a certain amount even if the visitor he referred does not buy anything from the merchant's site. An example of this would be Google AdWords. This is where ads are placed on your site by Google or some of the other Search Engines. However, typical fees for PPC affiliate programs are small, usually not exceeding a dollar for every click.</p><p>2. Pay Per Sale (PPS)</p><p>PPS affiliate marketing is the most popular among merchants and is also the most lucrative type for the affiliates. In this type of affiliate program, the merchant only pays the affiliate whenever his referral converts into a sale, paid subscription or anything else entailing a financial commitment by the customer or lead. This means great savings for the merchant in advertising costs. On the other hand, it becomes the most lucrative type for the dedicated affiliate, because commissions in PPP affiliate marketing can range from 15% to 20% and sometimes 75% of the actual product's sales price.</p><p>One the best advantages of PPS type of affiliate marketing is that you as the affiliate do not need to have a website of your own. You can make use of the PPC Method as mentioned above. You will then pay for the clicks on your advertisement that lead to the sales on which you then earn commissions.</p><p>This method of marketing can also be the cheapest way to start out in internet marketing. Especially if you create you PPC Campaign in one of the lesser search engines where you would pay far less for your add then you would with one of the larger search engines such as Google etc.</p><p>3. Pay Per Lead (PPL)</p><p>The pay-per-lead type of affiliate marketing is a variation of the PPS type and is often used by insurance and finance companies and other companies who depend on leads for their company to grow. In this method of affiliate marketing, the affiliate is paid whenever the visitor he referred to the merchant's site fills in an application form or any similar form related to the business of the company. Commission for this type of affiliate marketing is based on a fixed fee whose rates approximate that of the fixed fee in the PPS type.</p><p>Aside from these three specific types of affiliate marketing, a lot of other affiliate marketing types exist. If the classification is based on the depth of the affiliate network, it can be classified as single-level, two-level, and multi-level affiliate marketing. There is also another type of affiliate marketing that pays the affiliate each time the customer he has referred purchases something from the merchant's site.</p>URL:-</p><a href="http://www.success-affiliate-marketing.com">www.success-affiliate-marketing.com</a></p><a href="http://www.affiliatemarketing.infozabout.com">www.affiliatemarketing.infozabout.com</a></p>
