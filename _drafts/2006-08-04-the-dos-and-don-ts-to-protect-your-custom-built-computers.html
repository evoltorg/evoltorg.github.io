AVG by Grisoft has a free antivirus download. Get it right now, and as I’ve told you I’ve always loved the commercial program Norton Antivirus by Symantec.</p><p>3.

If you are fractional to Microsoft, then go ahead and exploit the one included with XP.</p><p>4.

Always applied Don’ts...</p><p>1. Be extra cautious when opening the Email attachments since you are not sure with that—even if they come from a known family member or friend’s Email account.  Viruses broadcast by infecting a PC and emailing themselves to everyone in the infected computer’s address book. Ponder a code word to exploit in the subject line of Emails. Your friends and family would know the particular keyword (maybe mango etc.) and would comprise this in the subject when attaching a file. A bad keyword may be Viagra.</p><p>2. Never provide your REAL email address when signing up for anything online until that site gets trusted through some sort of scan. It will fall it into enemy hands and you would spend most of your time sifting through trash when looking for real email. Ponder using the service at (www dot dodgeit dot com).
