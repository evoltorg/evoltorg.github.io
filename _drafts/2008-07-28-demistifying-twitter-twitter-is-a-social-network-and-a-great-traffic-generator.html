<p>This article attempts to show the nay-sayers how Twitter can be effectively used to network and expand your reach online. It is primarily of interest to people whose aim is to publish content and generate traffic online. However it should be relevant to anyone who's day to day live involves running, building or designing web sites.</p></p><p><p>Furthermore, I'll try and introduce you to a few new Twitter tools I've discovered recently, hopefully helping you to capitalise on Twitter's usefulness..</p></p><p></p><h2>What is Twitter?</h2></p><p><p>If you're an evolt user and you really haven't heard of Twitter, you've probably been living under a rock.. Twitter is a "micro-blogging" platform, best explained by the Twitter website itself:</p></p><p><blockquote>Twitter is a service for friends, family, and coâ€“workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent answers to one simple question: What are you doing?</blockquote></p><p><p>So how can 140 character status messages be the answer to generating traffic and expanding your online presence? Well, this depends on your area of expertise, but in this case I am going to focus on online content producers. </p></p><p></p><p><strong>Having a good Twitter network serves two purposes:</strong></p></p><ol></p><li>If you have a good network of like-minded followers, then you can tweet about things that you are doing and expect your followers to check it out, and hopefully tell their friends.</li></p><p><li>If you are following interesting and knowledgeable people, their statuses will give you an indication of what's of interest to them at the moment (they become a passive survey population). This way, you can use your Twitter network as inspiration for content creation etc.</li></p></ol></p><p><p>If you've read much about Twitter in the past, then these two benefits probably make sense to you, if you've used it, they definitely will. So why write an article to say something that is so obvious? I didn't.</p></p><p><p>The true value of Twitter is not in using it's service directly, it is its API support - and in particular the recently aquired search.Twitter.com api (previously called summize), which allows applications to gather information from Twitter *without* following people. </p></p><p></p><h2> API? Programming? What's it all mean to me?</h2></p><p>Well, it means that some clever people out there have produced tools that you can use to monitor what is going on in the twittter world *without* having to follow people (in fact, some of these tools don't even require you to have a Twitter account [ie: http://monitter.com]).</p></p><p></p><h2> So what are these tools and how should I use them?</h2></p><p><p>This is by no means an exhaustive list of tools for helping you maximise your results from Twitter (in fact it's deliberately a *very* short list).</p></p><p></p><h3><a href="http://monitter.com">monitter.com</a> - Live Twitter Monitoring</h3></p><p><p>Ok, the first tool we will look at is Monitter. Monitter is a new player in the Twitter mashup world and it basically allows you to "monitter" tweets off the public timeline. What does this mean? You input 3 search terms into the monitter site, and it will monitor Twitter and match those particular terms and display them to you in a nice clean, live streaming interface online.</p></p><p><p>The beauty of this is: you don't NEED a Twitter account, you can just hit the <a href="http://monitter.com">monitter.com site</a> and passively monitor what is going on on Twitter.  If you are a Twitter user, monitter can help you find more people to follow - people who are tweeting about topics you are interested in..</p></p><p></p><h3> <a href="http://tweetdeck.com">tweetdeck.com</a> - Revolutionising Twitter Desktop Clients</h3></p><p>Tweetdeck is an Adobe AIR client for Twitter that also includes search integration. You'll need a Twitter account, but if you have one, Tweetdeck is a great client because it will follow your normal Twitter friends, but also allow you to monitor for relevant keywords. </p></p><p>Currently in BETA, Tweetdeck is as stable as any AIR application I have used, and has recently replaced Twhirl as my desktop Twitter client.</p></p><p></p><h3><a href="http://search.twitter.com">search.twitter.com</a> - The Twitter Search API </h3></p><p></p><p>Formerly known as summize (until Twitter acquired them), the Twitter search api also offers a web interface that allows you to search the Twitter timeline for keywords (this is the driving force behind the tools above). This is a little less sophisticated than Tweetdeck or Monitter, however it does allow you to find relevant tweets. </p></p><p></p><h2>So what do I do now?</h2></p><ol></p><li>Sign up for a Twitter account (if you don't have one). When you post a new article, or build a new site, send a twitter link to it, so that people out there see it - if you've built up a decent network of twitterers, you'll find that the traffic rolls in.</li></p><p><li>Identify the topics you are interested in, and utilise the tools above to watch the twittersphere for those keywords (using tweetdeck or monitter.com).</li></p></ol></p><p>Happy tweeting!</p></p><p></p>
