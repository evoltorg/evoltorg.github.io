The mobile phone is a long-range portable electronic device used for mobile communication. In addition to its customary function to transmit voice, the new mobile phones include an array of other additional services and accessories. The additional services include SMS for text messaging, email, packet switching for access to the Internet, and MMS for sending and receiving photos and videos. </p>In the last twenty years, the position of a mobile phone in the society has changed drastically. Gone are the days when this piece of technology was considered rare, expensive equipment, restricted only to the rich and the business elite.  Today it is just a low cost personal item for all. With the un-seeming innovations of user friendly services, the usage of mobile phones is soaring high. In many countries the mobile phones have outnumbered the landlines. </p>In India too, the usage of the mobile phones have shot up. Due to the high levels of mobile phone service penetration in the society, it has become an important means of communication for people. With this increasing demand, there undoubtedly arises the need for supply. To cater to the growing need a number of stores have already established themselves in the mobile business and many more are budding up. </p>The increasing number of players in the market has sparked the battle for survival. But when the fruit is highly delicious it is a lot more than just simply surviving. Now the race is to grab the maximum share of this high potential market. Necessity is the mother of invention. Players in the market have introduced innovative ways to attract maximum buyers. Innumerable promotions and offers are the bait to catch the big fish. </p>On the other hand the customers also have got accustomed to these promotions, so much so that, offers is another separate criterion to be looked upon before making a purchase. They too are a deciding factor of the product. This consideration is however rare in high end mobile phones. </p>The offers may be monetary i.e. in the form of discounted price or in the form of free gifts. The competition has become so tough that the stores now leave no stone unturned to ensure that the customer gets complete solution to his mobile phone need. Therefore stores now have all the mobile phone accessories too. Some mobile stores also provide the mobile phone connections.</p>Therefore there are broadly two types of mobile stores, those that deal in only mobile handsets and others who also sell their services. There are outlets that are specific company based. There are stores that are of a particular handset brand eg: Nokia,etc. The other types of stores are those owned by the service providers. This you generally find in the CDMA category of phones eg: TATA, Reliance. In this case the store is a one stop shop for both handsets and the service. </p>However now there are innumerable stores who deal both ways. They sell both handsets and services. They need not be any brand oriented. They include all the different competing brands. Their sole motive is to earn profits, be it from any brand.</p>Mobile stores are becoming one stop solution to all your mobile phone needs so just go to any <a href="http://www.naaptol.com/buy-online/WO-shopping-deals-best-W4O/mobile_phones.html">mobile store</a> and buy your favorite mobile phone.</p>
