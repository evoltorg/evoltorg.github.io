Web design is not simply about aesthetics, it also has a serious place for businesses to succeed. In many instances clients rely almost exclusively on their search engine placement to secure their position in their relevant market to continue to make profits. This is where the right blend of web design and search engine marketing needs to be harmonised by an approach to a site's architecture that ensures it is highly visible on the search engines.</p><p>Many have said that search engine optimisation as some sort of 'trick', and of course it is. The title, meta tags, copy, domain name, outbound and inbound links all play their part in placement and it is the web designers job, when required, to ensure that these 'tricks' are applied consistently and favourably for the client whilst sticking firmly to 'white-hat' principles.</p><p>The latest Google update is said to have downgraded the relevance of directory listings and paid-for ads, which more or less leaves article writing as the primary source of that juicy PR7 inbound, Search engine marketers are certainly not going to let up on their set of methods aimed at improving the ranking of their clients' websites for keywords and phrases that are appropriate to its content and purpose. But the fact remains that the art of blending a site's look and feel with keyword-rich text, professional usage of the coding and linking strategies are a finely balanced art. The methodology of applying key research and 'shaping' the site's copy into the popularity of a client's search terms, will continue to bring many clients a much higher return on investment (ROI) than if the site was merely aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>And then came along Web 2.0, which loosely redefined the web designer into a market space that was termed by Wikipedia the “transition of websites from isolated information silos to sources of content and functionality…a computing platform serving web applications to end users and a social phenomenon referring to an approach to creating and distributing Web content itself, characterised by open communication, decentralisation of authority, freedom to share and re-use. Many sites are now supporting RSS feeds, which also has resonance in adding blogging software such as WordPress as a seamless extension to the website itself.</p><p>This practice, although not widely used yet, will I feel sure be the norm once both web design agencies and users start to realise the usefulness of the RSS feed in reading company news and events. So, in short, moving away from the standard practices of the aesthetic yesteryear, both search engine and blogging considerations should certainly feature in a site's architecture for commercial websites.
