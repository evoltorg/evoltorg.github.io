You can write an average article and still get a tremendous amount of traffic from it if your article includes three things. In this article let's talk about how to get more traffic from your article. The three main things I'm talking about the article must include is a catchy title, it must solve a problem, and it must have a well written resource box. Let's analyze these three things individually and see how they can have an impact on marketing your home based business. First of all the old saying that if you don't get read your dead definitely refer to article marketing. We might restate to say if your title doesn't catch a person's attention your article will never get read and then you are dead! You your title doesn't have to be crafty, it just needs to be interesting for help visit                            www.article-promotion-course.com. If you subscribe to the theory that your article should solve a problem then you want your title to tell people exactly what they're going to find when they read the article. </p>The best articles on the Internet today are articles that solve people's problems. I'm mentioning this from a home business standpoint. People are surfing the Internet every day looking for answers to problems they have. Certainly one of the biggest problems people face is how are they going to pay their bills, retire early, take a much needed vacation, and so on. These problems all relate to money and offer an excellent opportunity for you to write articles that help give them hope they can solve this problem. The last part of your article will be the resource box. This is also known as a bio box, and it gives you an excellent chance to direct your reader where they can learn more about you. The basics in your resource box should be your name, your website address, a brief sentence or two about your website, and then a call to action. </p><a href="http://www.lazyman-article-guide.com">www.lazyman-article-guide.com</a></p><p><a href="http://www.newbies-copywriting.com">www.newbies-copywriting.com</a></p><p>Your goal, very simply in the resource box is to get your reader to click on the link that you're giving them and direct them to your website, blog, or landing page.
