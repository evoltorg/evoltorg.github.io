excerpt: "Tackling competitive analysis by doing research, checking public records and  disclosures, assessing goals, branding plans and understanding customers."

<p align="justify">First,  let’s tackle competitive analysis. As an entrepreneur, you're no  doubt familiar with some of the conventional wisdom about how to  handle competitors. Do your research. Check public records and  disclosures about big name firms in your industry. Assess your goals,  branding plans, and future efforts in the context of the presumptive  goals of your industry rivals. Understand why customers choose  competitors over your firm -- both why they like your rivals and why  they refuse to work with you.</p></p><p>Beyond  this broad and relatively intuitive theorizing about competitor  analysis, however, you may not be that up-to-speed on the latest  tactics.</p></p><p>First  of all, purchase stock in rival companies. This may seem  counterintuitive – why support a rival firm at all? - but great  benefits await. Stockholders get regular reports on firms’ finances  and long-term strategies. You can glean a lot about your rivals’  positioning -- and see what other stockholders are saying -- all  without wasting dozens of hours on frustrating Internet research.</p></p><p>Second,  learn from your competitors’ competitors. You may have heard the  expression “my enemy’s enemy is my friend.” This tactic makes  use of a similar concept. You don’t have to do all the “oppo”  research yourself -- you can trade ideas, data, and strategies with  mutual competitors. Learn your rivals’ weaknesses as well their  strengths. The devil you know is almost always easier to handle than  the devil you don’t.</p></p><p>Stay  up-to-date on what’s happening in your industry. Go to conferences.  Don’t delegate the responsibility of watching your rivals to a  third party. Attend trade shows. Use Google, the Internet, and public  archives to investigate competitors. Don’t let your guard down --  even if you are an established “big dog” in your field. Be  knowledgeable and networked, and you will be less likely to be  surprised.</p></p><p>Finally,  remember that the competitive landscape  is always fluid. Your biggest competitor next quarter may be an  unknown today. Given the advent of global business markets and the  mixing of industries that globalization has created, there is almost  no way to anticipate what “the next big thing” will be in your  industry. But simply by maintaining a flexible posture, you will be  more agile when responding to new challenges.</p></p><p>In  terms of keyword research strategies that defy the conventional  wisdom, your best bet in general is to try out a variety of tactics  in a microcosm and then apply the ones that work in larger “marketing  laboratories.”</p></p><p>Employ  abbreviations, acronyms, and shortcuts -- real shortcuts that people  searching on Google would actually use. Keep things simple: “personal  computer” might be abbreviated as “PC”; the month of “January”  may be abbreviated as “Jan”; and so on.</p></p><p>Zero  in on better keywords. For instance, if you are marketing a Phoenix  real estate site, you might want to have a keyword for “Phoenix AZ  real estate,” since many people who search Google will abbreviate  Arizona as “AZ.” </p></p><p>Anticipate  typos, malapropisms, and misspellings when coming up with your  keywords. People may type too many or too few letters in a word, omit  key vowels, or switch letter orders around by accident. There is a  great site -- searchspell.com -- that can help you guess the most  popular misspellings and typos for particular words and phrases.</p></p><p>Throw  geographical references into your keywords. The more specific your  geo targeting, the easier time you will have not only at attracting  local business but also at ranking high in the general “lottery”  for Google rankings. For instance, if you are advertising a  Connecticut law firm, don’t just create keywords based on  permutations of “Connecticut,” “CT,” “law,” “lawyer,”  etc. Throw in names of nearby towns that your office would service,  such as “Simsbury,” “Avon,” “Farmington,” “Bloomfield,”  and “Hartford.”  You will have an easier time ranking, and your  resultant visitors will feel you are speaking and relating more  specifically to them.</p></p><p>To  increase the effectiveness and conversion of your keywords, think  about the action your demographic needs to take and titrate your  keywords down to specific action-oriented phrases.  “Los Angeles  mortgages” has some measure of geographic filtering; “Los Angeles  mortgage brokers” is better and more specific.  But “Los Angeles  home mortgage application” is better by leaps and bounds because  the phrase carries a significant amount of implied intent.  Of course  fewer people will search using that term, but the ones that do are  further along in the cycle, closer to closing a deal, and ready to  take action.</p></p><p>We at Beanstalk use AdGooroo's <a href="http://www.adgooroo.com/">keyword tool</a> and competitor analysis services to get an even more in-depth look at what our competitors are doing online to make sure we're not missing anything.  In this whole article – it's probably the more recommended of the tools.</p></p><p>Finally,  consider these all-purpose tips when piecing together your keywords  and key phrases:  liberally employ descriptive adjectives ( “top”  and “free”); vary up your verbs; use both singular and plural  permutations of critical words; rank for domain names if and when  appropriate; and research what your closest industry rivals do and  plot out your marketing strategy at cross purposes, as well as on a  parallel track, and see what true independent, even contrarian  thinking can do for an enterprise. The bottom line, of course, is  persistence and determination. You can get help, like this article,  to work smarter. Working harder, of course, is up to you.</p>
