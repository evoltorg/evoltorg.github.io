Jobrapido brings the next generation of online recruiting to Europe: Job searching rather than Job posting.</p>The number of companies and recruiting agencies that post vacancies on their own websites increases rapidly, Jobrapido job seekers with a unique possibility: you can search through the vacancies posted on traditional job boards and on all other sites containing employment opportunities from one spot.  </p> </p>Jobrapido works like a search engine: you enter a job title and/or a location and you obtain a list with all of the vacancies posted on hundreds of websites which match your search criteria. They are sorted by date, starting from the most recent ones.  The great advantage of Jobrapido is that the results page clearly indicates vacancy title, location, employer, the site on which each vacancy is posted and the date. Thus, job hunters can choose the most proper vacancies which match their job expectations and qualifications easily. </p> </p>With Jobrapido, job seekers may also subscribe Jobletter and be daily notified by email of all the <a href="http://www.jobrapido.ie/"> latest job vacancies </a> matching their search criteria. It is a useful opportunity for those who do not want to check up the site every day.</p>  </p>Jobrapido project was launched in Milan (Italy) and has already achieved a top three position among most popular employment related websites in Italy. It has been rapidly developing through all over Europe and South America. In Europe Jobrapido sites provide already up to 2 millions of <a href="http://www.jobrapido.co.uk/">job vacancies </a> arranged according to profession and location. </p><p>Since the beginning Jobrapido Team has been an enthusiastic, multilingual and multicultural group which aims to create the most modern internet platform for online job searching. In fact, with Jobrapido employment search may turn significantly easier and effective not only for job seekers but for employers and other websites as well. </p><p>To use Jobrapido in your <a href="http://www.jobrapido.com/">job search </a>, go to the main site with vacancy listings in Europe and South America. </p>
