<p>Hi and welcome. If you find yourself here, that means you want to build a directory, and you are probably very new to all kind of things like </p>html, php, SEO and related, or you can handle things, but you just took a break and you're looking for something interesting that is worth to read. </p>Well, what I wrote in the following lines describes my hole experience of being a webmaster to a directory like My Green Corner. I will write about </p>all the aspects, about building up a directory, promote it, creating link partners and link exchanges, the tools I use, blending into the market, </p>acting in new directions, the money I make with this hobby, the time I spend, and everything else related to this.</p></p><p><p>First thing is first, so let's start with the beginning. </p><br></p><p><p style="font-size: 150%;">1. The name.</p></p><p>There are around 10000 directories on web, or maybe even more, if we count the link-exchange directories most of the websites these days have.  </p>Many are very old, powerful, with huge traffic, very good advertised and have lots of people behind them.  Many offer things you can't  even imagine: back </p>massages, millions of $ in your bank account, trips around the world and much more... Just joking...</p>Now, seriously, you need an original name. "Free Web Directory" is already taken, so think </p>deeper. Let's take, for example, my directory, <a href="http://www.mygreencorner.com" target="_blank">My Green Corner</a>. Well, it definitely has originality. It sounds good, it's one of a kind, and I </p>could go on with all the hype. But here are the bad things: 3 words, very long domain name and  not quite a directory name as well. Hmm, the first </p>letter is very, very bad chosen too. In front of "m" comes "a", "b" and so on, and many guys out here see things alphabetically.  But what could </p>be a good directory name? From my personal experience, I think it should have the word "directory" in it. And it should start with "a". Or "1", </p>although numbers are not always a good idea. And it should be an easy to remember name. For example, "Aviva directory". A good directory name, </p>with a lot of advertising and money spent around it, equals a successful directory. But what if you don't have money? I didn't had any money when </p>I started this, and I assume you don't either.  Or maybe you have the money, but you are not risking them. So if advertising comes out of the question, </p>a good named should come in. Go fishing, do some thing inspiring, or just lay in your bed for a few days and think about your directory name. </p>These day are the most important for your directory. You may also want to take a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/trends" target="_blank">Google trends</a>, or at the <a href="http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html" target="_blank"> zeitgeist list</a>, if you want to see what are the most searched words on web for free.</p></p><p>For my directory, I have spent a week at the mountain. When I sat down on the chair, ready to chose my directory's name, I was seeing  green </p>everywhere, so the "MGC" choice was normal.</p><br></p><p><br><br><br></p><p><p style="font-size: 150%;">2. The hosting.</p></p><p>You have found a million dollar name, and now, you want to build a site. If you didn't knew until now, sites are not floating on air, they </p>are hosted on some little (or big, depending on preferences) black boxes we call servers.  Most of these servers have an operating system. Some of </p>them have chosen Linux because it's free, some of them have chosen Windows because is "nice".  Well, here comes the good part: you will take the Linux one. </p>Why? Because most of the open source applications have been developed for Linux. You know how they say that best things in life are free, right? </p></p><p>Now, about the money again, there are 2 types of hosting: free, and paid. If this is your first site, you can definitely settle down for the free one. </p>There are many free hosts that don't require a banner on your page, just type "free hosting" on Google and you're done. Look at some features, see if php </p>is enabled, if they provide mysql. Look at the bandwidth, see if they provide around 2Gbs, and if they are, you have found your hosting. But, because </p>almost all free web hosing is not so reliable, doesn't offer 24/7 customer support, doesn't have php enabled, has different bandwidth and processor load </p>restrictions, I recommend you choose the paid one. For somewhere between $50 and $150, many, many hosting companies offer good uptime, and almost all the </p>features you need to build your  directory. Choose a good name, or ask around on some forums about hosting. </p></p><p>I am now hosting my site on <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">Godaddy</a>. I got here after a lot of asking and looking, but I can say I am definitely </p>satisfied, until now. The customer support is very good, I always got feedback in a few hours after posting my questions. And believe me, I had a lot. </p>On this plan, called deluxe, I can virtually host as many sites as I want. This is a great opportunity for a low budget start, because I only paid around </p>80$/year. But if you have more advanced needs and know your way with apache, you may want to think about getting a more professional hosting.</p></p><p>Tip: always search the hosting before buying the domain. Most of the times, you will host you domain from where you have bought it, with the same </p>company.</p><br></p><br><br><br></p><p><p style="font-size: 150%;">3. The script.</p></p><p>There are many directory scripts out there. What I am using on My Green Corner is a script named phpld, from PhpLinkDirectory. It is the most used </p>script for directories. You can download the latest phpld  free version using this link:  </p><a href="http://www.phplinkdirectory.com/phpLD-2.1.2.zip" target="_blank">http://www.phplinkdirectory.com/phpLD-2.1.2.zip</a> or you can navigate to </p><a href="http://www.phplinkdirectory.com" target="_blank">phpld</a> site and buy the last version. Other scripts like esyndicat, or site-sift, are far behind in terms </p>of functionality, templates available, features, support and feedback, and online community in general. Take it from here or buy it, read the </p>instructions, and then install it on your server. </p></p><p>Here is how you do that. First, you will have to create a database on your hosting account. You can do that in your admin cpanel. After that, </p>you can use a ftp program to upload your files. I usually use Total Commander. Type "download Total Commander" in Google if you don't have it already, </p>download it, install it, open it and then press "CTRL+F" to open the connection manager. Use the hosting ftp username and password, and create a connection.</p> Connect  to your server and upload your files. Then follow the installation instructions. </p>   </p><p>Why am I using this phpld? Because of many reasons: I found great support on phpld forum, the admin interface is really nice and simple, the script's </p>code itself is very easy to understand, and, with little coding skills, you can transform it in whatever you would like, and I found many good templates </p>for it. </p>What are templates? Well, at first, I didn't knew either, and if you ask yourself this question, you definitely need to read the things below. Templates </p>are files that you add to your directory, so that you can make it look nicer. There are many places where you could find phpld templates, and one is </p>visiting the <a href="http://www.mygreencorner.com/freetemplates.php" target="_blank"> free phpld templates</a> page on My Green Corner. You can find many other free </p>templates on forums, on other directories and so on. They important thing is to take the template that matches your directory script's version, and to </p>follow the steps that are written in the text file inside the zip archive. Install a contact us page too, you will definitely need it. You will also need </p>a logo and a nice and original banner. There are a lot of free programs on web in which you can build a logo. Anyway, the best remains Photoshop. If you </p>are a beginner with Photoshop, type "Photoshop tutorials" on Google, and spend some days learning the basics. And another place where you would like to look for answers, and where i found a lot,</p>is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>, a site with many tutorials for anything that interests you.</p><br></p><p><br><br><br></p><p style="font-size: 150%;">4. The Birth.</p></p><p>Well, the birth... What could be more beautiful then giving life to things? Here is how you will give life to your directory, here is how I gave </p>life to My Green Corner. First, I posted on this big forums about it like crazy, with my directory in my signature:</p><br></p><ul></p><li></p><a href="http://www.phplinkdirectory.com/forum/" target="_blank">Phpld Forum</a> the most active community of directory webmasters</li></p><li></p><a href="http://forums.digitalpoint.com" target="_blank">DP Forum</a> the most active community of webmasters</li></p><p><li></p><a href="http://www.webmaster-talk.com/" target="_blank">Webmaster Talk</a> a very active community of webmasters</li></p><li></p><a href="http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/" target="_blank">Web Developer</a> An active community of  webdevelopers</li></p><li><a href="http://www.namepros.com" target="_blank">Name Pros</a> An active community of  domain name marketers.</li></p></ul><br></p><p>Like crazy, but to subject. Relevant stuff. My opinions. Try to help people where you can. Nobody like spammers on forums, but everybody appreciate </p>good </p>information.</p></p><p><p>If you can find other forums, that would be very good. All you have to do is to respect each forums rules, and to make your posts to the appropriate </p>section of the forum.</p></p><p>Second, subscribe you directory to all the other directories. This will require time, I know. It is always the best to do it yourself, using a </p>software </p>like <a href="https://paydotcom.com/r/2976/dugu/848652/" target="_blank"> this</a>. It was developed by a friend of mine that owns </p><a href="http://www.prolinkdirectory" target="_blank">Prolink Directory</a>, and it is very used all around </p>the </p>world. But if you don't have time, you can pay some other guys to do the dirty work for you. </p>Third, submit your directory to as many tops as you can. <a href="http://www.mygreencorner.com/alltops.php">Here</a> are the tops where I have submitted My Green Corner. I have even made a </p><a href="http://www.mygreentommy.com" target="_blank">directory top</a>, My Green Tommy, where you can submit your directory for free after you finish it, but we will talk about it later on.</p></p><p>All of these things take time, but you have to be strong, to keep your head up, because this is your introduction to the SEO world. What are you doing </p>now is Search Engine Optimization.</p><p> There is a site named <a href="http://www.directorycritic.com/ target="_blank">Directory Critic</a>. You can see this site has lists with many thousands of directories. Usually, after posting about your directory on dp </p>(Digital Point), it's webmaster automatically puts your directory on a list. But, if you can't find yourself on any list, you can ask him to place your </p>directory through a simple online form. Then navigate to your details page. Copy the link and place it into the email notifications your directory sends </p>to any subscriber, and ask politely for a vote there. High voted directories  get free quality traffic from there. </p><a href="http://info.vilesilencer.com/" target="_blank">Vilesilencer</a> is another place where you would want a link for your directory.</p></p><p>Write articles. You can see I write too. And believe me, it takes much time for me, because my native language is not English. So write some good </p>articles  and post them on the article directories you can also find on Directory Critic. You can also use <a href="http://www.isnare.com/" target="_blank">Isnare</a>, </p>a site that offers article submission to over 40000 article directories and publications.</p><br></p><br><br><br></p><p><p style="font-size: 150%;">5. Add quality.</p></p><p>Well, you have advertised your directory, and now, you have some links pending. Approve them very fast, to please your subscribers. You can use </p><a href="http://www.mygreencorner.com/autoapprover.zip" target="_blank">this tool</a> I got from a friend of mine that owns </p><a href="http://www.pegasusdirectory" target="_blank">Pegasus Directory</a> to approve as many listings as you want, very fast. Just make sure that they are quality links, </p>links that have good and unique content, that provide a real service to web surfers, and that are really useful. The only thing important is the quality of</p> your web directory. Gambling links should be in the Gambling category, Loans in the Financial one, and so one. Want my advice? Do not accept links on your</p> main categories. Do not accept reciprocal links from pages that look like a link farm. Link farms are not well seen by the Search engines, because they</p> where used in the past to manipulate their ranking algorithms. And do not accept inner pages. These tend to disappear with time, as webmasters modify the</p> structure of their site.  </p> </p><p><p>Update you site daily. Thus, you will be very loved by search engines. They like new stuff, and they will keep crawling new information on your website,</p> if you will give it to them.</p></p><p>Because your directory is most of the time used by webmasters, you can add some </p><a href="http://www.mygreencorner.com/freetools.php" target="_blank">free webmaster tools</a>, like the ones you see on My Green Corner. I have also used some web tools </p>from <a href="http://www.iwebtool.com/" target="_blank">Iwebtools</a>.</p><br></p><br><br><br></p><p><p style="font-size: 150%;">6. Links good to eat.</p></p><p>There are 2 kinds of links: "good" and "not so good". I will explain what are good links. "Not so good" links are all the others. Good links are links </p>that come from sites related to yours. For example, other directories, seo companies, and so on. It is like this because of the growing complexity of </p>Google and other search engine sorting algorithms. So, if you find your link on a page of site that has the main subject related to a directory, that's a </p>good thing. Good links are also links from sites that have no connection with yours,  but the page from where they are linking you has many other links to </p>similar sites, meaning links to other directories. Great links are .edu and .gov. These are most trusted by search engines, because they have a </p>non-economical value, but are also the most hard to get. </p> </p><p>If you find good sites, don't hesitate to contact their webmaster and to ask polite for a link exchange.<p><br></p><p><br><br><br></p><p><p style="font-size: 150%;">7. Go network.</p></p><p><p>Well, you made your first directory. You have taken care of all the things, and now, it's steadily going on autopilot. But why stop here? You have to</p> think big. You can make some more directories to strength up the first one. Or you can even make a top of directories. I have spent a few months and around</p> 1000$ building up My Green Corner network of directories, but now I have 9 of them.</p></p><p><p>All of them are offering free submission, and I'm planning to expand my network even more, with time. You can imagine the costs are growing too, </p>because I had to hire 2 people to do the directory submissions for all of them, then I had to do for each one of them on all the things I have described </p>above , and much more. But, speaking about the costs...</p><br></p><br><br><br></p><p></p><p style="font-size: 150%;">8. Money. Money. Money... </p></p><p><p>Oh, money. Everybody needs money. So do web directories. So, let me get straight to the point. </p></p><p>First, the costs.</p> </p><p>The costs for sustaining my network are around $100/mo*12(advertising subscriptions)  + $250(hosting) + $7*10(domain renewal) + $1500(for my employees - </p>they work on the contract) equals around $3000 per year. Not very cheap, huh?</p></p><p>But let's see the income.</p></p><p>To save me from more writing, I posted a screen shoot with my paypal account balance for all my directories in the last week (from the day I am writing </p>this). You can see there is some activity over there, almost every day.</p></p><div align="center"></p><img src="http://www.mygreencorner.com/img/payment.gif" alt="last week activity"></p></div></p><p>These payments come only from the directories and the services I offer on my directories. As you can see, I make around $100 in a week, which is not </p>very bad. </p><br></p><br><br><br></p><p><p style="font-size: 150%;">9. Before I finish...</p></p><p>I must warn you. This isn't an easy job. It wasn't easy for me to be where I am now. Being a web directory webmaster requires passion and sociability. </p>If you aren't into these kind of things, you may consider doing other things on web.</p></p><p>Thank you again, for reading this. Have a great day.</p><br>
