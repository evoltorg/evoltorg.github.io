Was it Forrest Gump's mom who said shoes tell a lot about the person wearing them?</p><p>With the advent of online classifieds, it seems that virtually and practically anything can be sold.  Baseball gloves, marbles, eyeglasses, Labrador puppies, motorcycles, autographed t-shirts, harmonicas, the sky's the limit. Even singer James Blunt has reportedly auctioned off his sister.  (Now don't get any ideas.  You're still better off making money from things, not people, that's been lying in your garage or attic)</p><p>Whatever the case, it seems anyone who needs quick; sure cash can just rummage for something precious looking in their possessions and peddle them off in the Internet.  As simple as that, and you won't run out of buyers.  Out of the billions of people frantically clicking their mouses, there's sure to be at least someone who specifically needs your Sue Grafton, R is for Ricochet Mystery novel.</p><p>But shoes?!  Well, yeah, SHOES.  People sell and buy shoes online.  Tennis shoes, trainers, basketball shoes, ballet shoes, anything shoes.  After all, the online classifieds is still the best place to find good deals and bargains, provided you don't run, ahem, barefoot into scams and spoofs.  </p><p>Yeah, shoes</p>Don't be shocked anymore.  The Internet-savvy generation of kids is no longer squeamish.  They are ready and willing to wear other people's shoes.  In fact there's even a certain pride to be had if their shoes are bought online.  Especially if it's the latest Adidas Pro-Model D or Nike Shox.</p><p>When 	buying shoes online, of course be sure they're you're right size, unless they're a present for a clown.  Secondly, be aware of ad descriptions for the product.  If it says, "never been used", then you're safe.  If it says, "slightly used", then it's still probably good.  But if it starts saying, "a few scratches here and there," then better have cold feet.</p><p>In general, you want to make the best and wisest online purchase ever, not just with shoes but all other stuff on the Net.  Most victimized buyers complain about the product in real-life not looking "as described" in the ad, so it's best that you meet up with the seller and personally inspect the goods.  If ever you don’t like the shoes, then at least you’ve made a new friend.  And then, just like Forrest, its run, run, run.</p>
