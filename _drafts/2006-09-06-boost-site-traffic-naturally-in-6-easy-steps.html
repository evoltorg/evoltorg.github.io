Here are some of the most effective strategies to drive countless traffic – especially targeted traffic – to your website.</p><ul></p><p>	<li><b>Research For Keywords and Keyphrases.</b></li><br><p></p><p>	Keywords and keyphrases are important for your website’s visibility. You should be able to get the most relevant keywords and keyphrases for your website. You can do this by using a keyword research tool. Through this tool, you will also be able to check the back links of your site’s competitors. You can try to get links from those sites, as well. </p><li><b>Have a Domain Name.</b></li><br><p></p><p>	Domain name is important because it increases the brand awareness and identity of your online business or website. If you have no domain name yet, it is advisable to use your company name. If it is not available, add a description – at least one word. Remember to limit your desired domain name to two words - try not to exceed on this.</p></p><p>	<li><b>Give Your Site Relevant Content</b></li><br><p></p>	</p>	It is important to give your website quality and relevant content that reflects a variety of keywords and keyphrases. Be sure that what you put on your website are original content. Don’t even think of stealing content from other websites. More relevant content on your site means higher chance of being visible on the search engine result pages for different search terms.</p></p><p>	<li><b>Simple Web Design</b></li><br><p></p><p>	Do you know what K.I.S.S. means? It is “keep it simple…” This applies to the design of your website. If you want better site traffic, avoid having an entire flash site. Keep your website’s design simple and navigable. Make it easy for your site visitors to find what they are in search for. A simple design will most likely make your visitors stay!</p></p><p>	<li><b>Keep The Size Of Your Pages Small</b></li><br><p></p><p>	A smaller sized page will load faster compared to a larger page. Remember that not all online browsers use high speed connection. If your site’s pages are too slow to load, your site visitors will definitely leave your site and look for a better website. So, to make them stay keep your pages smaller in size – especially the homepage!</p></p><p>	<li><b>Optimize your website.</b></li><br><p></p><p>	Optimizing your website will drive more traffic to your website. The title and the headers should contain the most relevant keywords or keyphrases. The content of the website must also carry your website’s keywords.</p></ul></p><p><p>These six simple steps will guarantee a higher rate of traffic to your website.
