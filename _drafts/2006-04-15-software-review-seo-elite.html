<br /><em>SEO Elite Price: $167<br /> Date Launched: 2004<br /> Date Purchased By Myself: 7/2005<br /></em><br /><p></p><p><h2>Introduction</h2><br /></p><p>Seo Elite is direct downloadable search engine marketing software, that helps automate many everyday tasks of the DIY optimizer. Its main focus is on link exchanges, and as many of us know, initiating link exchanges, adding/removing links from our directories, and finding acceptable link partners can be an extremely time consuming task. Its real purpose is to cut your time spent on tedious linking tasks to a minimum, and it does a pretty good job at it.</p><br /></p><br /></p><p><h2>How Much Spam is Involved?</h2><br /></p><p>I understand that automated marketing software can be a touchy subject. Unlike many other marketing programs, Seo Elite almost forces one to make a connection with the individual you are seeking to exchange site links with. This is good, as it makes it harder for one to simply gather a stack of unrelated website email addresses, and send out a mass email asking for a link exchange. <p>It stresses that every potential link partners website be visited by you personally, and in some cases, forces you to do so. The software also suggests using the appropriate API Keys be entered when querying search engines, so all are accounted for legally, and ethically.<br /><p></p><br /></p><p><h2>Features</h2><br /></p><ul></p><li>The ability to find and email link partners a variety of ways. You can search using keywords, using a link directory (dmoz), and even have it locate link exchange forms, such as the one used by LinkPartners.com users.</li></p><li>Analyze allinanchor:, allintext:, and allintitle:, for any website. This is good for guaging your competition, and identifying what keyphrases they are targeting</li></p><li>The ability to verify that all link partners are linking back.</li></p><li>Locate your position for given keyphrases, across the major search engines.</li></p><li>Gather how many pages of your site are indexed.<li></p><li>Finding, and studying, well optimized websites. This is one of the weaker features, as it simply gathers the top websites for any given keyphrases, and shows the number of appearances.</li></p></ul></p><br /><p></p><p>Quite possibly the best feature is the ability to create, and intelligently keep track of, your entire link directory. Adding and removing links, categorizing them, keeping track of exchanges, and uploading your directory, is all done much more easily then doing it by hand.<br /><p></p><br /></p><p><h2>Is It Worth It?</h2><br /></p><p>With all the marketing hype, and junk optimization programs out there, I was relieved to find one worthy of a review, and even a positive comment or two. If you have ever tried to situate hundreds or even thousands of link exchanges manually, you would probably agree that $167 is a small price to pay to simply keep track of everything. Although, before you purchase link building software, you have to learn how to link correctly, for the software to work like it is meant to. If this is understood, then the software is definately worth the price.</p><br /><p></p><p><h2>Summary</h2><br /></p><p>If you have been searching for a way to make all aspects of link building easier, and more coordinated, Seo Elite should work for you. There is a slight learning curve, and it does take time to get used to the interface, but all-in-all, its a nice edition to any marketing toolchest.</p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
