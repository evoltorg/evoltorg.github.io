Yes, it is time for youâ€™re to build your opt-in mailing list. You might be thinking, it is too early to do this, but today is always the right day to start.</p><p>When you were planning your online business, you should have considered your mailing list. Some people think it is a cost they can't afford, but most companies charge a very low fee, and you should be able to make far more than the cost to pay the bill each month.</p><p>If you're not sure how you will get to pay your bill, then see what you can go without in the short term. But, in the long term look at your list, and see how much you can sell to them, and see the sales being made.</p><p>Once you have made the decision to build your list, the next question is how do you build your list? So many people spend a lot of time trying to work out how to do this, but really is it simple. You need to start, and then test to see what is converting for you.</p><p>Different people will give different advice, but you need to test for your niche, and see what your conversion is like. You'll need to have an opt-in form for people to sign up. This needs to be placed where people can see it. It could be in the main body, or if could be in the sidebar, but it needs to be on every page of your site.</p><p>You'll need an incentive for people to sign up for your list, and if you are using a downline builder then this will be your main incentive. You'll be able to encourage people to join your downline, with the offers given to them to also build their downline list.</p><p>By using a downline builder you will be creating your list far quicker than using traditional methods. As you build using a double-opt-in you will find that soon you'll have a viral list signed up. They will be the voice in your marketing plan, and they'll build your list in a way that you hadn't even imagined before.</p><p>Gone are the days of building your list by one or two additions a day, you can now look forward to hundreds joining your list in a very short period. Soon, your list will be so big you will wonder why you didn't consider starting to build your list earlier.</p><p>The sooner you make your decision to start to build your list, the faster it will grow. If you only think about it, then nothing will happen. You need to put that knowledge into action, and get your opt-in started today. It doesn't take long to start to build, but it does it take to maintain your list, as you write those great newsletters. Those will build your relationship with your subscribers and in turn that will turn into many sales. Start today to have a long term relationship with your list.</p>
