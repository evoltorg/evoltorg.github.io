Google AdSense is certainly the most popular Pay per Click (PPC) program in the company nowadays. By joining your site under the said plans, AdSense will present a sequence of advertisement on your pages. You stand to earn every time a visitor of your clicks on these ads. </p><p>They don't have to buy anything, mind you. They just have to click on the ads and nothing more. These ads are by no means random. They are contextually related, meaning, they are assigned based on their relevancy to the subject of your site. </p><p>Could a blog substitute for regular sites when it comes to making capital through AdSense? Yes people, blogs can also be providing an additional income stream through AdSense! In some aspects, a blog is a more efficient tool for this purpose. </p><p>There are people online today making six figures per month from Adsense alone. Unbelievable but true! </p><p>There are three determinative parts for the winner of a site enrolled under the AdSense plan. </p><p>1. The Cost per Click (CPC) that is carried by the ads assigned to your site. </p><p>2. The number of page impressions, or simply put, the amount of traffic that passes through your site. If you garner a lot of page imitations, you have a better chance of gaining a lot of clicks. </p><p>3. The Click through Rate (CTR), which is the number of clicks your ads get per the number of visitors that visit your pages. The superior youâ€™re CTR, the more you stand to earn. </p><p>CPCs are a given. If you're dead set on a subject for your blog, then you will just be attracting a certain group of ads. But if you wish to make a blog for the primary goal of making money online, then you have to choose the right keywords before everything else. </p><p>Basically, your blog will be assigned certain ads based on the keywords prevalent in its entries. There are some keywords that will attract ads that pay high, and there are those that will attract ads that pay low. The trick is in finding the high paying keywords around which you will create your blog. </p><p>Here are some tips that will help you find those keywords with relative ease: </p><p>* Create an account at. Adwords, of course, is the advertising colleagues of AdSense. When you become a member, you could take a peek at how much the going rates are for certain keywords. </p><p>* Visit. This is one of the very few sites that give information about high paying keywords for free. It would rather be kept a secret by those who discovered it, so keep it quiet ;-). </p><p></p>The number of your page impressions really depends on the traffic that you can generate for your blog. Blogs would have an easier time with this because, as we've previously discussed in past lessons, search engines love them. But of course, this is not set in stone. If your participants, for example, are also using the blogging policy, then you're all in equal grip. </p><p></p>Increasing your CTR is an entire subfield in itself! There are a plethora of strategies dedicated for this purpose. We have discussed some of these tactics in my information sheet, as well as my own blog at. These include the choice of ad design, the placement of the ads, and the colors to be used, among other things. I'm telling you, increasing your CTR has become a science of sorts in recent months!</p>
