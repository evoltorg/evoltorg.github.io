Hi,</p><p>I have designed a template website, www.hot7.biz.</p><p>Basically, the client sales website templates with 10$. Now, my problem is as follows ... We made the shop with paypal, after a user pay he need to click on continue and the template will download ... now the client would like to to it exactly the same, but with the posibility of receiving the download link on email. Can this be made? The site is made with Joomla ...</p><p>Thank you,</p>Christian.
