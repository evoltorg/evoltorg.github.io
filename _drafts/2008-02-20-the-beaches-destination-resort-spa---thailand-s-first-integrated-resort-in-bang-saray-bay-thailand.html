 </p>With the support of the Board of Investment of Thailand and the Tourism Authority of Thailand, The Beaches will be the new shining symbol of the country and will be the benchmark of destination resorts in Asia.</p>It has also joined with True Corporation, one of Thailand’s largest technology companies, to create Thailand’s first wireless lifestyle convergent communities which will feature state-of-the-art technology throughout the entire project.</p>The masterplan architect and designers behind the success of The Beaches Resort & Residences are award winning world class design firms – Carl Ettensperger of C&C Studio and Terry Henriksen of Henriksen Design Ltd, who have worked on 5-star hotel projects such as Mandarin Oriental, Hyatt Hotels, Ritz Carlton, Siam Paragon Bangkok, Huvafen Fushi Maldives (2008 Worlds Best Beach Resort, Harpers Bazaar Travel), Hard Rock Hotel – Universal Studios, Florida, and many more prestigious resorts.</p>Set over 88 rai of landscaped gardens, man-made beaches, and water lagoons, The Beaches private community will have four grand 5-star hotels, stunning water villas and Private Residences. The Beaches Resort has the best of everything – International Waterpark and Surf Park, The Beaches Longevity & Wellness Spa, state-of-the-art fitness club, a Grande Promenade with an international village with over 20 restaurants and retail, tennis academy and a Watersport centre. It is also centrally located in the heart of Thailand in Bang Saray Bay, a tropical oasis – 10 minutes from Pattaya and only 90 minutes from Bangkok</p>Chairman and CEO of Pacific Shore Developments, Liakat Sultan Dhanji, has been responsible for making the brand a success. According to him, Thailand needs something distinctive if it is going to stand out against the stiff competition developing in the region.</p> V9 Design & Build, were invited to build the resort’s website and, from initial discussions with Mr Dhanji, ideas were centred on creating an architecture that would concentrate on eMarketing by employing Web 2.0 technologies.</p>Living in Bangkok, you see glitzy front-page supplements that dominate Thailand’s English dailies, full-page magazine and newspaper colour ads that abound large project launches, and the billboards that predominate the city and Skytrain. You can only imagine the cost of such publicity and its significant impact on a project’s bottom line.</p>That is not to say that elegantly-produced brochures and local media advertising doesn’t have merit, but it has always seemed  that it is a sort of marketing overkill — a gunshot rather than rifle approach to project exposure.</p>Professional blogging: it increases company revenue over time through the marketing and relationship building power. The ability to write effective, interesting, and informative blog posts has proved itself be a highly cost effective option.</p>It is even more effective when added as a seamless addition to a resort’s website for several reasons. First, Google and the other major search engines like content and change which adds value to a site’s PageRank™; it extends keyword range; it is disseminated to the world’s largest blog directories; and it is accompanied by RSS. Article writing and press releases can be submitted to the world’s largest websites, especially two that are associated with Google and Yahoo.</p>Over the last few years, search engines have made it increasingly difficult to reach a targeted audience. Gone are the days of mailers, link exchanges and non-industry-related links. Even with ezines, there’s no guarantee you will be read. A great alternative to this is RSS (Really Simple Syndication). It is not a well-known method for companies to publish and distribute content in this format (e.g. publicity releases, news, newsletters and articles). Syndication means you don’t have to visit each site individually to see what’s new — you simply scan headline summaries in a reader and click to read the full text.</p>Most real estate projects use Flash technology that presents brilliantly-animated images but fail with their eMarketing efforts because of it. Search engines cannot see beyond the front page. There are two large property developers in Thailand, both of which have projects that have only their home pages listed. Both are poor examples of internet marketing and are therefore spending fortunes on print advertising. In contrast, The Beaches will bypass outdated marketing methods by creating a wealth of exposure, both in Thailand and internationally.</p>The Beaches, to our knowledge, will be the first large-scale real estate development project in Asia to employ Web 2.0 as its online publicity vehicle.</p>http://www.soho-properties.com/thebeachesthailand/</p><p></p>
