A news.com article is reporting that e-commerce agencies are becoming increasingly picky, with some refusing to consider clients who do not look like they will spend $1m over the next 12 months. Some of the numbers quoted are amazing - firms hiring 30 employees a month, receiving 50-500 serious inquiries and business development calls per week, and turning down anyone who isn't willing to blow $2m on a Web site. <P></p>Drew Ianni from <a href="http://www.jup.com/">Jupiter Communications</a> has warned that if the demand for e-commerce sites drops, and interactive agencies have been too cocky, they might find themselves lacking clients, and needing to dump staff and equipment. <P></p>However, it <b>is</b> up to the agencies to choose the 'supermodel' way of "not getting out of bed for less than $10k a day". For many, it is far from economical to run with cheaper projects when, as Cimeron Dunlap from Organic Online suggests, the time required to initiate a project is one to two months. <P></p>You can find the news.com article <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,41250,00.html?st.ne.fd.gif.j">here</a>. <P>
