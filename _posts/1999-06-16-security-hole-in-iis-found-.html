A pretty serious security hole has been found in Microsofts IIS4.0 webserver. By sending a buffer overflow, which is basically a large amount of data, to some pages, the buffer spills out of the HTML root directories and allow programs to be run on the server.\n<P>\nThe scary thing is, I've already seen 10 lines of Perl code that have expoited the bug.<P>\nCheck out the full story here at <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/20231.html">Wired</a> or get it straight from the <a href="http://www.eEye.com/database/advisories/ad06081999/ad06081999.html">company that discovered it</a>.
