user_biog: "<p><a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> is a Jedi Master in the art of creating sites and keeping servers running. This often means hitting them repeatedly with forces that defy rational explanation, though he prefers to descibe it as \"administration\". When he\'s not practising his percussive skills on E450s and AS400s, he can be found masquerading as the senior developer for some <a href=\"http://www.getfrank.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"My current employer\'s website\">widely varied clients</a>. It\'s still not certain whether or not the meanings of CMS, CRM, and B2B have penetrated the alcoholic fog enveloping his brain, but he makes convincing noises to customers about XML, XSLT, Python, J2EE, PHP, Perl, C++, and OpenGL.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> has been in the web game pretty much since it began, and still has fond memories of the time when a web could be swept aside with a duster and spam was pork luncheon meat. Despite being the developer of one of the first commerce sites in Europe, he has yet to make any real money.</p>
<p>Being English, <a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> doesn\'t like SOAP, but instead has recently discovered something called <a href=\"http://www.zope.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Zope website\">ZOPE</a>. Zope is a platform that runs <a href=\"http://plone.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Plone. It\'s cool.\">Plone</a> which he thinks is the coolest thing since <a href=\"http://www.opengl.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OpenGL site\">high-performance, real-time 3D APIs</a>, which he often writes small games in.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> lives in <a href=\"http://www.brighton.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Brighton\">the best little city in the world</a>, and used to commute 5 hours a day on British trains. He is subsequently immune to all forms of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=monty+python+spanish+inquisition\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nobody expects this\">torture techniques</a>.</p>"

The World Wide Web Consortium has announced that the IETF has approved the draft standard for HTTP 1.1, a new HTTP standard that is due to increase speed and quality of web data transfer.<p></p>From the W3C press release:<p></p>"HTTP is the primary protocol of the Web, originally proposed by Tim Berners-Lee while he was at CERN. HTTP/1.0, co-authored by Berners-Lee, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Roy Fielding of the University of California at Irvine, was the first version of the HTTP that was widely used on the Internet. Although extremely popular, it had several significant performance issues that, combined with increased use of the Web, caused severe load problems on many parts of the Internet.<p></p>The purpose of HTTP/1.1, first proposed by Roy Fielding while at ICS/University of California at Irvine, is to provide higher end-user performance while preserving the integrity and stability of the Internet using features including persistent connections, pipelining, caching, and IP address preservation.<p></p>As important, the HTTP Digest Authentication mechanism, described in the accompanying HTTP Authentication specification, defines a method for authenticating a user to an HTTP server without exposing the user's passwords to potential eavesdroppers. This is an important step toward improving security on the Web."<p></p>The full press release is available from the <a href="http://www.W3C.org" target="_blank">W3C web site</a>.</p>
