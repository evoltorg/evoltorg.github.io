excerpt: "The Section 508 web site fails to hit some of its own guidelines.  Here\'s what we can learn from what they missed."
---
<p><em>(Note: I have contacted the webmaster at the section508.gov web site and</p> haven't received any response concerning these issues.)</em></p></p><p><p>In 1998, the U.S. Government drew up guidelines for accessibility for</p> internet and IT initiatives within the Federal Government, known as Section</p> 508.  They have since set up a <a href="http://www.section508.gov/"</p> title="Section 508 - New window" target="_blank">Section 508 web site</a> to help government agencies meet</p> the necessary guidelines.  Unfortunately, a quick <a</p>href="http://bobby.cast.org/bobby/bobbyServlet?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.section508.</p>gov%2F&output=Submit&gl=sec508" title="Bobby Check for Section508.gov - New window" target="_blank">Bobby</p> check</a> shows that the Section 508 web site fails to achieve some of the</p> guidelines they outline.  Let's look at what they missed and what we can learn</p> from it.</p></p><p><blockquote></p>When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow</p> people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements,</p> and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including</p> all directions and cues.<br></p><a href="http://bobby.cast.org/bobby/html/en/508.html#22n" title="Section 508,</p> Part 1194.22, Paragraph n - New window" target="_blank">Section 508, Part 1194.22, Paragraph n</a></p></blockquote></p><p><h2>Mistake 1: Explicitly associate form controls and their labels with the</p> LABEL element.</h2></p><p><p>Basically, every device must have some cue to associate any given form</p> control with a label defining what it is.  This is done, quite simply, by using</p> the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tag around the text label of the form field, and</p> adding the <code>id</code> attribute to the associated</p> <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> tag.</p></p><p><pre></p>&lt;label for=&quot;first&quot;&gt;First Name:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;first_name&quot; id=&quot;first&quot;</p> value=&quot;First Name&quot;&gt;</p></pre></p><p><p><label for="first">First Name:</label><br></p><input type="text" name="first_name" id="first" value="First Name"></p></p><p><p>This technique also has the added benefit in some browsers of allowing the</p> text label to be clickable for some form elements, as has been described <a</p> href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Form_Labels/4090/15823/index.html"</p> title="Form Labels evolt.org Article">elsewhere on evolt.org</a>.</p></p><p><h2>Mistake 2: If there are logical groupings of form controls, use FIELDSET</p> with LEGEND on each group.</h2></p><p><p>This requires that groupings of form elements (usually meaning groups of</p> radio buttons or check boxes) be marked as such using the</p> <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> tags, like</p> so:</p></p><p><pre></p>&lt;fieldset&gt;</p><p>&lt;legend&gt;What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen</p> swallow?&lt;/legend&gt;</p><p>&lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;velocity&quot;</p> id=&quot;velocity1&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;velocity1&quot;&gt;1.8</p> m/s&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>&lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;velocity&quot;</p> id=&quot;velocity2&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;velocity2&quot;&gt;2.1</p> m/s&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>&lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;velocity&quot;</p> id=&quot;velocity3&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;velocity3&quot;&gt;What do</p> you mean, an African or a European swallow?&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p><p>&lt;/fieldset&gt;</p></pre></p><p><p><fieldset></p><p><legend>What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?</legend></p><p><input type="radio" name="velocity" id="velocity1" class="main"> <label for="velocity1">1.8</p> m/s</label><br></p><input type="radio" name="velocity" id="velocity2" class="main"> <label for="velocity2">2.1</p> m/s</label><br></p><input type="radio" name="velocity" id="velocity3" class="main"> <label</p> for="velocity3">What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?</label><br></p><p></fieldset></p></p><p><p>The most immediately obvious change is that many browsers (IE5.X+ and NN6.X+)</p> will render the <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> tag by default with a border</p> around the element.  However, a CSS definition of <code>border-width:0px</code></p> will remove that.</p></p><p><h2>Mistake 3: Include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text</p> areas.</h2></p><p><p>This guideline is probably the most problematic of the three, because it can</p> be at odds with usability.  This states that since some devices will skip form</p> elements that do not have a default value, that you predefine a default value</p> for every form element.  Obviously, this can cause problems with users</p> unwittingly leaving default data in form fields.  You could use JavaScript to</p> empty out the form field using an <code>onfocus</code> attribute, but you don't</p> want to rely on JavaScript exclusively (especially for accessibility purposes).</p>  The better solution would be to use JavaScript to empty the form field (which</p> would be fine for most users) and then use a trimming function on the backend</p> to remove excess whitespace.</p></p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p><p>I really don't mean to hang Section 508 out to dry.  I am happy that the U.S.</p> Government is making a concerted effort to push for accessibility on the</p> internet.  However, we need to be careful that as we promote accessibility</p> online, our sites are also accessible.</p></p><p><p>If you are looking for further information on accessibility, and these rules</p> in particular, see these sites:</p></p><p></p><ul></p><li><a href="http://bobby.cast.org/bobby/html/en/gls/g41.html" title="WAI</p> Checkpoint 12.4 (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">WAI Checkpoint 12.4:</p> Explicitly associate form controls and their labels with the LABEL</p> element.</a></li></p><li><a href="http://bobby.cast.org/bobby/html/en/gls/g43.html" title="WAI</p> Checkpoint 12.3 (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">WAI Checkpoint 12.3:</p> If there are logical groupings of form controls, use FIELDSET with LEGEND on</p> each group.</a></li></p><li><a href="http://bobby.cast.org/bobby/html/en/gls/g109.html" title="WAI</p> Checkpoint 10.4 (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">WAI Checkpoint 10.4:</p> Include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and text</p> areas.</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.section508.gov/" title="Section 508 (Opens in a New</p> Window)" target="_blank">Section 508</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.w3.org/wai/" title="The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative</p> Guidelines (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">Web Accessibility</p> Initiative Guidelines</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.cast.org/bobby/" title="CAST's Bobby (Opens in a New</p> Window)" target="_blank">Bobby Validator</a></li></p></ul></p>
