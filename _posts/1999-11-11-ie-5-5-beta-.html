<P>According to ZDNet's gossip columnist, IE 5.5 <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/filters/katt/">just shipped out</a> to a select group of testers.</P>\n<P>\nNew features? A 'print preview' page and a number of bug fixes are said to be included in the new release. What <B>we</B> want to know is, 'Does it finally *fully* comply and support <a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3</a> standards???'.</P>\n<P>When will MS produce a fully compliant browser and follow the good example of Netscape? Let everyone know what you think by leaving a comment below.</P>
