In the latest round of <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~dbaron/css/test/results">testing</a> CSS & HTML4 compliance (including CSS2) WebTV, Netscape Navigator, MSIE, Mozilla, and Opera reveal interesting results about their standards support - or in some cases, the complete lack thereof.</P> <P> Out of 104 possible total points, Netscape Navigator scored a <b>-41.5</B> on the low end while <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> had the top score with 38 while Opera came in second, and IE5 ranked a disappointing third.</P> <P> You can find out more about the testing procedure <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~dbaron/css/test/">at David Baron's CSS testing site</a>. <P> <P>
