Media giant Bertelsmann and Lycos want their search engines in Europe to work together by 2000. <P> In Europe, Lycos is owned 50 percent by Lycos, 25 percent by Bertelsmann through the publisher Gruner+Jahr and 25 percent by Christoph Mohn. <P> Fireball is now also offering thematically ordered search results, from a selection of 200 000 Web sites. The new Fireball search features, by the way, have been also funded with capital from the European Union. <P>       <p><a href="http://www.lycos.de" target="_blank">Lycos Deutschland</a></p>       <p><a href="http://www.bertelsmann.de" target="_new">Bertelsmann</a></p>       <p><a href="http://www.fireball.de" target="_new">Fireball</a> <P> <P>
