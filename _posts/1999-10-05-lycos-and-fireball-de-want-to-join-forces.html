Media giant Bertelsmann and Lycos want their search engines in Europe to work together by 2000. <P> In Europe, Lycos is owned 50 percent by Lycos, 25 percent by Bertelsmann through the publisher Gruner+Jahr and 25 percent by Christoph Mohn. <P> Fireball is now also offering thematically ordered search results, from a selection of 200 000 Web sites.
