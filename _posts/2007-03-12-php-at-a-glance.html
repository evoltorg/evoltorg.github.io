<strong>PHP at a glance</strong><br></p><p><strong>History</strong><br></p><p>PHP was conceived by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and he called it “Personal Home Page Tools”.<br>\nPHP/FI released in 1995.<br> \nPHP/FI 2.0 released in 1997.<br>\nPHP 3.0 released shortly afterwards re-written by Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski.<br>\nPHP 4.0 released in 1999. At the core of PHP 4.0 lies the Zend scripting engine.<br>\nPHP 5.0 addressed the object oriented model adding numerous new features.<br></p><p><strong>Introduction and strength</strong><br></p><p>PHP stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor.It is Open Source and free .A PHP file may contain text, HTML tags and scripts. Scripts in a PHP file are executed on the server.PHP is easier to learn because its syntax is similar to C, Perl and Java .It runs on different platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.).It is compatible with a wide range servers(e.g Apache, IIS, etc.).The mode of execution is interpretation.<br> </p><p><u>syntax</u><br></p><p>A PHP scripting block always starts with <?php and ends with ?> and these are called the PHP tags. The delimiters <? and ?> is also accepted.Anything outside its delimiters is sent directly to the output and not parsed by PHP.A PHP scripting block can be placed anywhere in the document.Each code line in PHP must end with a semicolon.<br> \nIn PHP, we use // to make a single-line comment or /* and */ to make a large comment block.<br></p><p><pre>\n<?php\n//statements here\n?>\nregular html here\n<?php\n//more php statements\n?>\n</pre></p><p><strong>Data Types</strong><br></p><p>PHP supports eight primitive types.<br>\nBoolean<br> \nInteger<br> \nFloat or double<br>\nstring <br> </p><p><u>Two compound types</u><br>\narray \nobject \n	\n<u>Two special types</u><br>\nresource \nNULL <br></p><p><strong>Variables</strong><br></p><p>All variables in PHP start with a $ sign symbol. Variables may contain strings, numbers, or arrays.<br></p><p>In PHP we have a list of predefined variables called superglobals and they listed below:<br></p><p>$GLOBALS: An array of all global variables.<br> \n$_SERVER: Variables set by the web server or otherwise directly related to the execution 	environment of the current script.<br> \n$_GET: Variables provided to the script via the GET method.<br> \n$_POST: Variables provided to the script via the POST method.<br> \n$_COOKIE: Variables provided to the script via HTTP cookies.<br> \n$_FILES: Variables provided to the script via HTTP post file uploads.<br> \n$_ENV: Variables provided to the script via the environment.<br>\n$_REQUEST: Variables provided to the script via the GET, POST, and COOKIE input 	mechanisms.<br>\n$_SESSION: Variables which are currently registered to a script's session.<br> \nTo concatenate two or more variables together, use the dot (.) operator<br></p><p><strong>Arrays</strong><br></p><p>There are three different kind of arrays:<br></p><p>Numeric array - An array with a numeric  key .<br>\nAssociative array - An array where each  key is associated with a value .<br>\nMultidimensional array - An array containing one or more arrays .<br></p><p><u>syntax</u></p><p><pre>\n<?php\n	\n	$names[0] = 'manju1';\n	echo "The  name is $names[0]";\n	\n?> \n</pre></p><p><strong>Declaring and using Constants</strong><br></p><p><u>syntax</u>\n	<?php\n	define("CONSTANT", "Welcome.");\n	echo CONSTANT; \n	\n	?></p><p>\n<strong>Operators</strong><br></p><p>An operator is something that you feed with one or more values which yields another value. There are three types of operators :<br>\nUNARY<br>\nBINARY<br>\nTERNARY<br> </p><p>Broadly they fall into the following category<br>\nArithmetic Operators<br>\nAssignment Operator<br> \nBitwise operators<br>\nComparison Operators<br>\nIncrement/Decrement Operators<br>\nLogical Operators<br> \nString Operators<br>\nArray Operators<br> </p><p>\n<strong>Control structures</strong><br></p><p>If \n<pre>\n	<?php\n	if ($val1 > $val2)\n    		//statements here\n	?>\n</pre> \nelse \n<pre>	\n<?php\n	if ($val1  > $val2) {\n    		//statements here\n	} else {\n    		//statements here\n	}\n	?> \n</pre>\nelseif\n<pre>\n	<?php\n	if ($val2 > $val2) {\n    		//statements here\n	} elseif ($val2 == $val2) {\n    		//statements here\n	} else {\n    		//statements here\n	}\n	?> \n</pre></p><p>while \n<pre>\n	<?php\n	$val = 0;\n	while ($val <= 5) {\n    		echo $i++;\n	}\n	\n</pre>\ndo..while \n<pre>\n	<?php\n	$val = 0;\n	do {\n    		//statements here</p><p>	} while ($val > 0);\n	?> </p><p></pre>\nfor\n<pre> 	\n<?php\n	for ($val = 0; $val <= 5; $val++) {\n    		//statements here\n	}\n	?>\n</pre>\n \nforeach \n<pre>\n	foreach (array_expression as $value) statement\n	foreach (array_expression as $key => $value) statement </p><p></pre>\nswitch\n<pre> \n	<?php \n	switch ($val) {\n	case 0:\n    		//statement\n    		break;\n	case 1:\n    		//statement\n    		break;\n	}\n	?> \n</pre>\n	\n<strong>Functions</strong><br>\n	\nIn PHP there are more than 700 built-in functions at our disposal.<br></p><p>How to create a PHP functions:<br></p><p>All functions start with the word "function()" <br>\nName the function - It should be possible to understand what the function does by its name. The name can start with a letter or underscore (not a number)<br> \nAdd a "{"  - The function code starts after the opening curly brace<br> \nInsert the function code<br> \nAdd a "}"  - The function is finished by a closing curly brace<br></p><p><strong>Advance concepts in PHP</strong><br></p><p>PHP provides four functions which enable you to insert code from other files.<br> </p><p>include()<br> \nrequire()<br> \ninclude_once()<br> \nrequire_once()<br> </p><p>All the above functions take a local file or URL as input. require() and include() functions are virtually similar in their function but they behave differently while handling the resource. include() and include_once() provide a warning if the resource cannot be retrieved and try to continue execution of the program if possible. require() and require_once functions stops processing the page if they cannot retrieve the resource.<br></p><p><strong>Session in PHP</strong><br></p><p>Session is used to preserve certain data across subsequent accesses.<br>\n<pre>\nsession_start(); 			//Start the session\n$_SESSION['name'] = $User; 		//Register user as a session key \nsession_destroy();			//Destroys all the session variables\n</pre></p><p><strong>Cookies in  PHP</strong><br></p><p>Cookies are a mechanism for storing data in the remote browser and thus tracking or identifying return users. You can set cookies using the setcookie() or setrawcookie() function. Cookies are part of the HTTP header, so setcookie() must be called before any output is sent to the browser.<br>\nA cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests for a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too. With PHP, you can both create and retrieve cookie values.<br></p><p>The PHP $_COOKIE variable is used to retrieve a cookie value.<br> </p><p><strong>Classes & Objects</strong><br>\n \nClass: A class is a collection of variables and functions working with these variables.<br>\nConstructor: An initialization function which is called automatically when an object is being constructed from the class.<br></p><p>You create instances of objects in PHP using the "new" keyword.<br> </p><p><u>syntax</u></p><p>variable = new ObjectName(parameters)</p><p>Everytime you access something in an object you create (in PHP), you use the "->" characters.<br></p><p><strong>creating a class</strong><br></p><p><pre>\n<?php\nclass dummy{\nfunction myfunc($param1)\n{\n//statements;\n}\n}\n?>\n</pre></p><p><strong>Database connection in PHP</strong><br></p><p>PHP supports connection with many databases.Lets have a look at the PHP/MySQL connection <br>\n<pre>\n<?php\n$username = "name";\n$password = "password";\n$hostname = "localhost"; </p><p>//connection to the database\n$Conn = mysql_connect($hostname, $username, $password) \n or die("Unable to connect to MySQL");\necho "Connected to MySQL<br>";</p><p>//select a database to work with\n$query = mysql_select_db("db",$Conn) \n  \n//execute the SQL query and return records\n$result = mysql_query("SELECT statement here");</p><p>//fetch tha data from the database \nwhile ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {\n   //display the results\n  \n}\n//close the connection\nmysql_close($Conn);\n?>\n</pre></p><p><strong>Summary</strong><br></p><p>This article gives a brief overview of PHP.The beginners will find it extremely useful in \nlearning and using PHP for their web development requirement.The concepts and syntax are quite familiar and aesy to learn and use.<br></p><p>\nBy\nManjushree Das.\nmindfire solutions\n(www.mindfiresolutions.com)</p><p>
