excerpt: "Read this article to learn about new features designed to improve the evolt.org community and web site."
---
<p>Over the past few months, several new features have been added to further enhance evolt.org's strong community.  Some features are a direct result of feedback received from the recent evolt.org survey.  Also, a new version of the source code has also been compiled and is available from <a href="http://thecode.sf.net" title="Get thecode" target="_blank">sourceforge</a>.</p></p><p><h2>Author Recognition</h2></p><p><p>Probably the most noticeable changes are the features that have been added to enhance the recognition of evolt.org's authors.  On each article page, there is an author-specific block of information which includes:</p></p><p><ul></p><li>the author's full name and user id which links to the author's page;</li></p><li>a graphic representation of the number of articles published by the author (i.e. the <a href="/cubes_definition/">cubes</a>);</li></p><li>a space for the author's photo if provided (see <a href="/The_baby_is_growing_a_community_feeling#upload">Upload Your Information</a> for more details);</li></p><li>date the user registered his/her evolt.org account;</li></p><li>date the user last logged on to the evolt.org web site;</li></p><li>total number of approved articles that the author has written;</li></p><li>the author's average rating received (based on all approved articles written by this author which have been rated);</li></p><li>total number of ratings received by the author; and,</li></p><li>links to the author's email address, member page and bio (see next paragraph).</li> </p></ul></p><p><p>Also on each article page is the author's bio if it has been supplied (see <a href="/The_baby_is_growing_a_community_feeling#upload">Upload Your Information</a> for more details), and a list of five other articles written by the author. This information appears at the end of the article.</p></p><p><p>The author's photo and bio (if supplied) will also appear on his/her user page; see my <a href="/user/Mishka/4292/" target="_blank" title="View User Page - Opens new window">user page</a> for an example.</p></p><p><!--</p><p>One final improvement has been made to article ratings.  There is now a graphical representation of each article's current rating.  The keywords used for rating articles have also been slightly modified.  You may wish to revisit any article ratings you have previously assigned.</p></p>--></p><a name="upload"></a><h2>Upload your Information</h2></p><p><p>All authors are encouraged to submit their information.
