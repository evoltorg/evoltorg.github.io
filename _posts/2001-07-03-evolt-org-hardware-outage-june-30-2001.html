<p>\n<strong>UPDATE</strong> - 12:15pm CST, Tuesday July 3rd --<br />\nemail, ftp, ssh(for those that had it) php, cf are all \nback up on the members.evolt.org server. \nbrowsers.evolt.org and lists.evolt.org are back up \nas well while dir.evolt.org remains down. \nPretty much anything that connected to mysql is \ngoing to be down for a while yet. \nIf you had a members.evolt.org account and used mysql, \nyou've got a 50/50 chance for data integrity. \nThis includes me too. I'm having a really difficult \ntime getting any data integrity, but we'll see how it goes. \nAgain, apologies for the downtime and thanks for your \ncontinuing patience. - .djc.\n</p></p><p><p>\n<strong>UPDATE</strong> - 01:00 GMT, Monday July 2nd --<br />\nThe machine is slowly but surely coming back. \nThe hardware failure has been taken care of \n(it was a drive failure), and the data and applications \nare being restored/reinstalled. We're almost there, but \ngetting the machine fully operational might take until tomorrow. \nWe'll keep updating this article as things progress.\n</p>\n<p>\nThanks again for all of your patience. We'll have you up soon.  - bob\n</p></p><p>\n<p>\n<strong>NOTICE</strong> - 10:30am CST, Sunday July 1st --<br />\nThe same machine that was hit by the <a target="_blank"  href="http://evolt.org/article/outage/25/12159/index.html">evolt.org server outage June 20 2001</a>\nis <em>back down</em> and all services mentioned in that article \nare again offline. It looks like hardware failure hit this time, \nand unfortunatly, nothing can be done until Monday morning. \nWe'll have more information at that time. Thanks again for your \npatience. - .djc.\n</p>
