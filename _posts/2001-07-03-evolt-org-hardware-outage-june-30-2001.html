<p></p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - 12:15pm CST, Tuesday July 3rd --<br /></p>email, ftp, ssh(for those that had it) php, cf are all </p>back up on the members.evolt.org server. </p>browsers.evolt.org and lists.evolt.org are back up </p>as well while dir.evolt.org remains down. </p>Pretty much anything that connected to mysql is </p>going to be down for a while yet. </p>If you had a members.evolt.org account and used mysql, </p>you've got a 50/50 chance for data integrity. </p>This includes me too. I'm having a really difficult </p>time getting any data integrity, but we'll see how it goes. </p>Again, apologies for the downtime and thanks for your </p>continuing patience. - .djc.</p></p></p><p><p></p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - 01:00 GMT, Monday July 2nd --<br /></p>The machine is slowly but surely coming back. </p>The hardware failure has been taken care of </p>(it was a drive failure), and the data and applications </p>are being restored/reinstalled. We're almost there, but </p>getting the machine fully operational might take until tomorrow. </p>We'll keep updating this article as things progress.</p></p></p><p></p>Thanks again for all of your patience. We'll have you up soon.  - bob</p></p></p><p></p><p></p><strong>NOTICE</strong> - 10:30am CST, Sunday July 1st --<br /></p>The same machine that was hit by the <a target="_blank"  href="http://evolt.org/article/outage/25/12159/index.html">evolt.org server outage June 20 2001</a></p>is <em>back down</em> and all services mentioned in that article </p>are again offline. It looks like hardware failure hit this time, </p>and unfortunatly, nothing can be done until Monday morning. </p>We'll have more information at that time. Thanks again for your </p>patience. - .djc.</p></p>
