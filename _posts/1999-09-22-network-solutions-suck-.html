So, I'm not the only one who isn't a wonderfully happy friend of NSI, but this example </p><p>goes <b>beyond</b> just pissing me off - this is an insult to everyone who is based </p><p>outside of the US.</p><p>Non-americans have long been unimpressed with the general american attitude towards the </p><p>top level domains (.COM, .NET, .ORG, etc). When was the last time you saw an american </p><p>company with a .com.us domain? To be completely honest, I can't even remember having </p><p>*ever* seen one...</p><p>The United States has adopted many international TLD's as well as the registration </p><p>process, the payment currency, etc, but this is not what I have a problem with; after </p><p>all, the Internet was funded and "born" in the United States. What angers me is that </p><p>when I go to <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/" target="_new">Network Solutions</a>, check to </p><p>see if a .COM is available, and attempt to register it using my contact information, it </p><p>won't let me do so.</p><p>Where exactly is the problem occurring? In the "Account Holder (Registrant)" form, and, </p><p>specifically, the <i>State/Province</i> and <i>Zip/Postal Code</i> fields. I'm </p><p>Australian - I live in South Australia, which is abbreviated to "SA", and my postcode is </p><p>"5000". NSI refuses to accept this when I try to submit the form. It comes back with </p><p>"The state abbreviation you used, 'SA', is not valid" and "The postal code must be a </p><p>number between 00005 and 99995". OK. Entering the postcode as "05000" keeps NSI happy in </p><p>that regard, but it still won't accept the SA. Note that I have taken care to specify </p><p>that my country is "Australia -- AU" in the dropdown box provided.</p><p>Why won't it accept SA? Just because SA happens to not be the abbreviation of one of the </p><p>"united" states? I try leaving the state field blank, and resubmitting. No luck - it </p><p>says: "The Address you have provided is too short. Please use the 2-letter state </p><p>abbreviation."</p><p>I just tried that!</p><p>NSI has completely failed to consider that not every country has a 5 digit postcode, and </p><p>not every state or province is abbreviated to 2 letters. Luckily, there are now alternatives (other ICANN accredited registrars), and they're alternatives I will be trying when I next have some free time to retry grabbing the domain I'm after.</p><p>Two of these registrars are:</p><p><ul></p><li><a href="http://www.internetnamesww.com/" target="_new">Internet Names WorldWide</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.register.com/" target="_new">Register.com</a></li></p></ul></p><p>I encourage others to post URLs of registrars they've used, and their experiences and tips. I have emailed NSI about the problem, and will add a comment when I hear back from them.
