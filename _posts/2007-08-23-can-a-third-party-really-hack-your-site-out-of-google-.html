I received an email today that was very disconcerting. I wanted to \npost it for everyone who may be concerned about their rankings on Google.  </p><p>Here is the email/article:</p><p>Here's a very interesting blog post by Dan Thies. I thought you\nguys could learn from what happened to Brad...</p><p>"Google Proxy Hacking: How A Third Party Can Remove Your Site From\nGoogle SERPs" </p><p>In June of 2006, while working to resolve some indexing issues for\na client, I discovered a bug in Google's algorithm that allowed 3rd\nparties to literally hack a web page out of Google's index and\nsearch results. I notified a contact at Google soon after, once I\nmanaged to confirm that what we thought we were seeing was really\nhappening.</p><p>The problem still exists today, so I am making this public in the\nhope that it will spur some action.</p><p>I have sat on this information for more than a year now. A good\nfriend has allowed his reputation to suffer, rather than disclose\nwhat we knew. I continue to see web sites that are affected by this\nissue. After giving Google more than a year to resolve the issue, I\nhave decided that the only way to spur them to action is to publish\nwhat I know.</p><p>Disclaimer: What you're about to read is as accurate as it can be,\ngiven the fact that I do not work at Google, and have no access to\ninside information. It's also potentially disruptive to the organic\nresults at Google, until they fix the problem. I hope that\npublishing this information is for the greater good, but I can't\ncontrol what others do with it, or how Google responds.</p><p>I am also not the only person who knows about this hack.</p><p>    * Alan Perkins (who along with many others stayed quiet about\nthe 302 redirect bug for 2 years) knew about it the day after I\nfound it.</p><p>    * Danny Sullivan has known nearly as long, and I suspect that\nhis behind the scenes efforts are the reason why the major search\nengines all decided to publish "how to validate our spider"\ninstructions after SES San Jose last year.</p><p>    * Bill Atchison knows, because he helped me figure out a\ndefensive strategy for my client's sites... and along with me danced\naround this issue on the "Bot Obedience" panel at SES last year -\ntrying to warn people without telling them too much.</p><p>    * My (now former) client Brad Fallon knows... and he's been\nsubjected to a lot of unfair criticism that he could have easily\nanswered by making this public. It cost him a lot of money, and "a\nlot of money" to Brad is a lot more than it is for most of us.</p><p>    * "Someone else" knows, because they were actively exploiting\nthis bug to knock one of Brad's sites off of Google's SERPs. I\nsuspect many other "black hats" know about it by now... because other\nsites are being affected. I can't believe that they're all accidents.</p><p>This is going to be a long story, I'm afraid... but bear with me,\nbecause you need to understand this, and how to defend yourself.</p><p>The story begins over a year ago...</p><p>My friend Brad Fallon had been having some troubles with Google,\nand one of his web sites, My Wedding Favors. In June of 2006, after\nexhausting all of his other options, Brad (who knows his way around\nSEO) hired me to direct his search marketing efforts and, in simple\nterms "figure out what the hell is going on with Google."</p><p>The first thing I discovered was that he wasn't "banned," but that\nGoogle was indexing everything on his site except for the home\npage. It took about two weeks of research and testing before I\ndeveloped a working theory. When we searched Google for phrases\nthat should have been completely unique to the My Wedding Favors\nhome page, we kept finding a particular kind of duplicate content:\nproxies.</p><p>For those who don't know what a proxy is, it's a web server that's\nset up to deliver the content from other web sites. Among other\nthings, proxies have been set up to allow people to surf the\ninternet "anonymously," since the requests come from the proxy\nserver's IP address and not their own. Some of them are set up to\nallow people to get to content that is blocked by firewalls and URL\nblocking on corporate, educational, and other networks...</p><p>There's more.</p><p>Click this link to read the rest of the story...</p><p>http://www.seofaststart.com/blog/google-proxy-hacking\n
