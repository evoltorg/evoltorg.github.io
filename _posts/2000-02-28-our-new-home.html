<P>Greetings and welcome! We've recently changed servers for the evolt.org website to provide better service(basically we were starting to get killed on our other machine :)</P>\n<P>\nNot only did we move servers, but also to a different operating system(Linux), Database(Oracle), and version of Cold Fusion(4.5) - so even though we tested everything out, there <I>might</I> be some problems. If you notice <B>anything</b> out of the ordinary or different, please <a href="mailto:dcody@oracular.com">contact me directly</a> and I'll get the problem fixed.\n</P>\n<P>\nA lot of hard work from a lot of people has gone into making this happen, thanks to them all. The migration did take a long time, as some of you know. Hopefully when things get settled down and the bugs are worked out, we'll put together a tutorial about our adventures.. Have fun!!\n</P>
