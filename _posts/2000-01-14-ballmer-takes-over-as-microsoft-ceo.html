<P>Bill Gates announced he was stepping aside as CEO of Microsoft last night and promoted long-time friend and underling Steve Ballmer to succeed him.</P><P>For more information please read the <A HREF="http://www.nypost.com/business/21974.htm" TARGET="_blank" TITLE="Click here to read the full story at the New York Post (http://www.nypost.com/)">full story</a>.</P><P>My personal thoughts on this, which were also mentioned in the article, is that Ballmer is going to take over MS until the debated "Breakup" of Microsoft. Bill  will step up into the other division. BUT, Microsoft is of course denying that this move has anything to with the DOJ's desires to break them up. </P> <P>
