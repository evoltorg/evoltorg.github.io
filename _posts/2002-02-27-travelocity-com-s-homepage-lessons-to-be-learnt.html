<p><strong>5.77 out of 10: </p>  that's the score eShopability has given <a href="http://www.travelocity.com" target="_blank">Travelocity.com</a>'s </p>  new site (version of February 8, 2002).</strong> </p></p><h2>Length, width and size</h2></p><p>The site uses </p>  the liquid layout technique, which enables the page to automatically adapt itself </p>  in width to the screen resolution used by the visitor.</p></p><p>This is an interesting </p>  technique, since it optimizes the way the page is displayed no matter what screen </p>  resolution the visitor uses.</p></p><p>However, the structure </p>  of the homepage has be constructed with great care to ensure that the display </p>  maintains a certain coherence with all resolutions and guides the user's eye </p>  to the parts of the page the site wants him to look at. </p></p><p>This is where </p>  <a href="http://www.travelocity.com" target="_blank">Travelocity</a>'s new homepage </p>  makes its first big mistake.</p></p><p>The automatic </p>  repositioning of the elements has a disastrous effect here when a resolution </p>  of 800x600 pixels (the most common) is used: a large empty space appears to </p>  the right of the search engine, which unbalances the right-hand side of the </p>  page and greatly reduces its effectiveness.</p></p><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"></p>  <tr></p>    <td align="center"> </p>      <img src="http://www.eshopability.com/pic/articles/2002-2/800x600travel.gif" width="130" height="75" border="1" alt="Screenshot of Travelocity homepage"><br></p>        800x600 resolution</p>    </td></p>    <td align="center"> </p>      <img src="http://www.eshopability.com/pic/articles/2002-2/1024x768travel.gif" width="130" height="79" border="1"  alt="Screenshot of Travelocity homepage"><br></p>        1024x768 resolution</p>    </td></p>  </tr></p></table></p><p>Another point </p>  to be mentioned on the technical side is that, at 129KB, Travelocity.com's homepage </p>  is clearly too big: it takes 36 seconds to download it with a 28.8 kbps modem, </p>  which is much too long for a homepage. </p></p><p>This is due to </p>  the length of the page - 1420 pixels - meaning that the user with a screen resolution </p>  of 800x600 pixels has to scroll down 4 screens to get to the bottom of the page.</p></p>      </p><h2>Merchandising </p>  elements ... not very visible</h2></p><p>This brings us </p>  to Travelocity's second big mistake: with a 800x600 resolution, its special </p>  offers and deals - in fact, all the categories except for the search engine </p>  - are only visible from the second vertical screen onwards and stretch over </p>  3 screens lengthwise.</p></p><table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="0"></p>  <tr></p>    <td><img src="http://www.eshopability.com/pic/articles/2002-2/completetravel.gif" width="130" height="240" border="1"></td></p>    <td> </p>      <p>From the </p>        2nd vertical screen onwards, all the merchandising elements (Fare watcher, </p>        flight deals, etc.) are displayed more or less in the center of the page, </p>        and are stuck between a menu on the right and a column on the left that, </p>        like the top part of the screen, includes a huge empty space (more than </p>        half its surface).</p></p>      <p>Moreover, </p>        with a 800x600 resolution, when you scroll down from the second screen, </p>        you can't help noticing that the elements are placed not only in three </p>        columns of different widths, but also at varying heights in each column, </p>        making it extremely tiring to read the page.</p></p>      </td></p>  </tr></p></table></p><p>The elements in </p>  the three columns are not separated clearly enough, the gray lines between the </p>  different areas are too faint to create a clear division between the categories. </p>  It follows that, on this part of the page, there is no clear eye-path. </p></p></p><p>This means that </p>  users will look at it in an unfocused way, which greatly reduces its effectiveness.</p></p><p>It should also </p>  be noted that only one photo, and a rather small one at that (100x80 pixels), </p>  is used to help sell the products on the page.</p></p><p>At Travelocity.com, </p>  they seem think that they will be able to get users dreaming about taking a </p>  trip simply by presenting it to them in text format &#133;</p></p><p>To finish with </p>  the merchandising aspect, we also noted that new products are found right at </p>  the bottom of the page - 1150 pixels down from the top: bravo to the users who </p>  scroll right down to the 4th screen to find them!</p></p> <h2>The </p>  site's online identity: quality and clarity</h2></p><p>A certain number </p>  of elements enter into the equation here: logo, tag line, window title, favicon.ico, </p>  etc.</p></p><p>Although the logo </p>  is fine (except that it hasn't been changed the site was first created, and </p>  hasn't aged very well), putting &quot;A Sabre Company&quot; under the Travelocity.com </p>  name as a kind of tag line, is not, in my opinion, a very bright idea commercially. </p>  Although all travel agents know what Sabre is, I'm not convinced that the majority </p>  of visitors do.</p></p><p>The site's real </p>  tag line is, in fact, only displayed in the window title: &quot;Travelocity.com </p>  - Go Virtually Anywhere! Airline Tickets, Hotels, Cars, Vacations and Cruises.&quot;</p></p><p>And when we look </p>  at the window title, we can see that the site has made another mistake: it's </p>  too long!</p></p><p>Window titles </p>  should be limited to 64 characters so that they can be displayed in full when </p>  users bookmark the page. As you can see in the image below, the tag line is </p>  cut off after the word &quot;Cars&quot;:<br></p>  <img src="http://www.eshopability.com/pic/articles/2002-2/travelocityfav.gif" width="371" height="22" border="1" vspace="10"><br></p>  One positive point, </p>  though, is that the site uses a favicon.ico file reproducing its logo, as you </p>  can see in the image. In addition, the title starts with the name of the site, </p>  another positive point.</p></p><h2>Search </p>  engine - navigation</h2></p><p>Search engines </p>  are one of the key elements on an eTourism homepage. However, some of the sites </p>  in the sector put several search features (flights, vacations, cars, etc), on </p>  their homepages, with the result that they crowd up the page.</p></p><p>Travelocity.com </p>  has found a very intelligent way of getting round the problem: on its homepage </p>  it only offers a search feature for flights, and lets users access 5 other search </p>  engines - lodging, cars/rail, vacations, cruises and deals - simply by clicking </p>  on the tabs to the left of the search feature.</p></p><p>The tabs, with </p>  their highly visible pictograms, stand out well on the page. They allow users </p>  to access not just the corresponding search engine, but also the main page for </p>  that category.</p></p><p>The choice of </p>  displaying one search engine at a time, and combining it with navigation functions, </p>  is an idea to worth remembering.</p></p><p>It is also worth </p>  noting that the site's main navigation features are all found on these tabs; </p>  the top menu bar is just a mirror reflection of the tabs.</p></p><h2>Customer </p>  relation elements - almost nonexistent</h2></p><p>No phone number, </p>  no chat feature, no email address on the homepage.</p></p><p>To contact the </p>  site, you have to go through the &quot;Customer Care&quot; category (which changes </p>  its name, moreover, in the footer menu at the bottom of the page, where it is </p>  called &quot;Customer Service&quot;...) and search through an extremely dense </p>  page (3 and a half screens long!) to find what you're looking for.</p></p><p>Similarly, if </p>  you want to subscribe one of the newsletters offered by the site (Travelocity </p>  real deals and Travelocity Insider), there is no way of doing this on the homepage. </p>  Not only that, but before you can actually subscribe to them, you have to become </p>  a Travelocity member.</p></p><p>And, while we're </p>  on the subject, nowhere on the site does it mention how often the newsletters </p>  are sent out.</p></p><p>To sum up then, </p>  this is a homepage with rather limited eShop-ability capacities (ability to </p>  convert browsers into buyers), that only manages to achieve a slightly above </p>  average score (5.77 out of 10) because its search engine is well-presented and </p>  intelligently combined with navigation functions.</p></p><p>Apart from that, </p>  we found that, out of the 160 criteria we use to judge the quality of homepages </p>  (see our study &quot;<a href="http://www.eshopability.com/reports/homepages/presentation.htm" target="_blank">Homepages </p>  that sell</a>&quot;), nearly half were unsatisfactory.</p></p><p>All in all, a </p>  rather surprising and disappointing result for one of the world leaders in the </p>  sector.</p></p><p>Luc Carton<br></p>  <a href="http://www.eshopability.com" target="_blank">eShopability.com</a> </p>
