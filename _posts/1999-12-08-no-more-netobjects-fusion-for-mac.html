"After much research and consideration, we have decided to no longer develop new versions of NetObjects Fusion for Macintosh", they said, but gave no specific reasons. Until December 31, 2000, version 3.0 users will have continued support via newsgroups and existing tech-support resources.</p><p>In a <a href="http://www.netobjects.com/products/html/nfmacinfo.html" target="_new">page</a> titled "Notice to current NetObjects Fusion 3.0 Macintosh customers", NetObjects have offered a free <a href="http://www.netobjects.com/products/html/macxgrade.html" target="_new">migration</a> to NetObjects Fusion for Windows 4.0.</p><p>Development of NetObjects Fusion for Windows will continue.
