<p  class="side" style="padding:5px;">\n<strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The browser archive, members.evolt.org site, and all lists will be down until probably Friday, August 9 as they go through further configuration.  But otherwise the move has been successful so far.\n</p></p><p><p>\n This weekend, we're moving evolt.org's servers from <a href="http://www.starkmedia.com/">Starkmedia</a> in\n Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where they've been hosted and maintained by Dan Cody since early 2001, to\n their new home at <a title="link to CSI 1st" href="http://www.csi1st.net/">\n http://www.csi1st.net/</a> in Altavista, Virginia, courtesy of Ron Dorman.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n We'll be flipping the switch at about 1700 hours GMT on Friday 2nd August, loading the\n boxes into Matt Warden's car and he will drive them all the way south to Altavista.\n We expect to have everything back up, tested and with DNS running normally shortly\n before midnight GMT on Wednesday 7th.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  Evolt.org's sincere thanks go to Dan for the dedicated time, effort and cost involved in\n keeping our services up and running, and we  wish him well.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n Thanks also go to StarkMedia, Dan's employers,  for their kindness and understanding in\n allowing Dan the time and space to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n Hosting evolt.org is no mean feat for anyone. As well as physically keeping the boxes \n up and running, evolt.org goes through about 140GB a month bandwidth. We're currently\n looking for donations to cover the additional costs which Ron's company will \n incur in hosting evolt.org and also to make sure Matt isn't personally out of\n pocket for a 1500+ mile round trip.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n There's info on how you can help (and why) at \n <a href="/help_support_evolt/">http://evolt.org/help_support_evolt/</a>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n To keep those additional costs down, we're  also very much looking for people who \n can host a mirror of some or all of evolt's browser archive, currently running \n through about 100GB a month.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n It will be set up so that you can offer a  monthly allocation of as much or as \n little as you have going spare. Once it's used, your mirror will drop out of \n the rotation, so you don't get any nasty surprises in your hosting bill.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n If you're able to help, or you've got any questions, drop a note to\n <a href="mailto:give@evolt.org ">give@evolt.org</a>.\n  </p>
