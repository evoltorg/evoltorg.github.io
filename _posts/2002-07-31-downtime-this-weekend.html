<p  class="side" style="padding:5px;"></p><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The browser archive, members.evolt.org site, and all lists will be down until probably Friday, August 9 as they go through further configuration.  But otherwise the move has been successful so far.</p></p></p><p><p></p> This weekend, we're moving evolt.org's servers from <a href="http://www.starkmedia.com/">Starkmedia</a> in</p> Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where they've been hosted and maintained by Dan Cody since early 2001, to</p> their new home at <a title="link to CSI 1st" href="http://www.csi1st.net/"></p> http://www.csi1st.net/</a> in Altavista, Virginia, courtesy of Ron Dorman.</p>  </p></p>  <p></p> We'll be flipping the switch at about 1700 hours GMT on Friday 2nd August, loading the</p> boxes into Matt Warden's car and he will drive them all the way south to Altavista.</p> We expect to have everything back up, tested and with DNS running normally shortly</p> before midnight GMT on Wednesday 7th.</p>  </p></p>  <p></p>  Evolt.org's sincere thanks go to Dan for the dedicated time, effort and cost involved in</p> keeping our services up and running, and we  wish him well.</p>  </p></p>  <p></p> Thanks also go to StarkMedia, Dan's employers,  for their kindness and understanding in</p> allowing Dan the time and space to do so.</p>  </p></p>  <p></p> Hosting evolt.org is no mean feat for anyone. As well as physically keeping the boxes </p> up and running, evolt.org goes through about 140GB a month bandwidth. We're currently</p> looking for donations to cover the additional costs which Ron's company will </p> incur in hosting evolt.org and also to make sure Matt isn't personally out of</p> pocket for a 1500+ mile round trip.</p>  </p></p>  <p></p> There's info on how you can help (and why) at </p> <a href="/help_support_evolt/">http://evolt.org/help_support_evolt/</a></p>  </p></p>  <p></p> To keep those additional costs down, we're  also very much looking for people who </p> can host a mirror of some or all of evolt's browser archive, currently running </p> through about 100GB a month.</p>  </p></p>  <p></p> It will be set up so that you can offer a  monthly allocation of as much or as </p> little as you have going spare. Once it's used, your mirror will drop out of </p> the rotation, so you don't get any nasty surprises in your hosting bill.</p>  </p></p>  <p></p> If you're able to help, or you've got any questions, drop a note to</p> <a href="mailto:give@evolt.org ">give@evolt.org</a>.</p>  </p>
