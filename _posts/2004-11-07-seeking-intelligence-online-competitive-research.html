<p>Finding online information</p>about your competitors is easy - the difficult part is finding meaning.</p>When researching the competition, you can avoid pitfalls by seeking</p>'intelligence' instead of 'information'.</p></p><p>The difference between</p>'information' and 'intelligence' is twofold: purpose and process.</p>Having a purpose and a process for gathering information ensures that</p>the results will be useful - instead of merely informative.</p></p><p>A well-defined purpose allows</p>you to search the Internet broadly and deeply without drowning</p>in a flood of marginal information.</p></p><p>The process for gathering good</p>competitive intelligence is straightforward: identify industry/market</p>trends and competitors; define your questions; find the answers;</p>analyze the results; and act on them.</p></p><p>The process begins with a wide</p>search of the Internet to define trends in your industry/market and</p>competitors. </p></p><p>Useful</p>resources include search engines, newspapers, business journals, and</p>trade press and online newsletters. Consider resources such as <a</p> title="opens in a new window" href="http://www.newsisfree.com"</p> target="popup">NewsIsFree</a></p>and other topical news 'clipping' sites. <a</p> href="http://www.prnewswire.com" title="opens in a new window"</p> target="popup">PR</p>Newswire</a> and <a href="http://www.businesswire.com"</p> title="opens in a new window" target="popup">Business</p>Wire</a> can be useful sources for</p>news releases and competitive <abbr title="public relations">PR</abbr>.</p></p><p>Beginning with a broad</p>industry/market search decreases the likelihood that you'll overlook</p>potential competitors and non-competing businesses in the industry that</p>may pose as sources of benchmarking, market insight and inspiration. </p></p><p>Once you've identified trends</p>and competitors, you can identify the questions you want to answer</p>about your competitors. Finding competitors' identities, pricing,</p>plans, strengths, weaknesses, suppliers and customers play a very</p>important part in formulating an effective business strategy. </p></p><p>Finding answers often begin at</p>a competitor's own web site. When visiting competitors' web sites look</p>beyond product/service information. You can also learn by viewing a</p>competitor's employment opportunities, organization chart, supplier and</p>vendor lists, and press releases. </p></p><ul></p>  <li>Explore</p>their news/press area.</p>Often, you can download their press kit or add your personal email</p>address to their email subscription list. </li></p>  <li>Search engines make it easy</p>to</p>find PowerPoint presentations, speeches and white papers. Use search</p>terms such as <abbr title="Microsoft PowerPoint Document">.ppt</abbr>,</p>    <abbr title="Microsoft Word Document">.doc</abbr></p>and <abbr title="Adobe Portable Document Format">.pdf</abbr></li></p>  <li>Topics such as Investor</p>Relations often include annual reports (even for private companies).</li></p>  <li>Forms that ask "How did you</p>hear about us?" provide a list of locations where the company is</p>spending marketing dollars.</li></p></ul></p><p>After you've explored a</p>competitor's web site, use other web sites to learn about their</p>organization. Conduct keyword searches on search engines, public</p>records sites, discussion groups and blogs.</p></p><p>Notable</p>sites:</p></p></p><ul></p>  <li><a href="http://www.archive.org" target="popup"</p> title="opens in a new window">WayBack</p>Machine</a> <br></p>An Internet archive. Use this site to see historical versions of the</p>company's web site. It will help determine changes in branding and</p>offerings.</li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.fuckedcompany.com" target="popup"</p> title="opens in a new window">F***edCompany.com</a><br></p>A site featuring company rumors and internal memos.</li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.alexa.com" target="popup"</p> title="opens in a new window">Alexa</a><br></p>Obtain traffic information about the traffic ranking, page views, and</p>reach of a competitor's web site.</li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.uspto.gov" target="popup"</p> title="opens in a new window">US</p>Patent &amp; Trademark Office</a> <br></p>Conduct a basic patent search on competitors</li></p></ul></p><p>These</p>represent only a handful</p>of sites that are useful for gathering competitive intelligence. Based</p>on your industry, competitors, questions and creativity, it is possible</p>to find a wide selection of useful online/offline resources. </p></p><p>According to the <a href="http://www.scip.org" target="popup"</p> title="opens in a new window">Society</p>of Competitive Intelligence Professionals</a>,</p>more than 95% of information that is required for gathering competitive</p>intelligence is publicly available from open sources.</p></p>
