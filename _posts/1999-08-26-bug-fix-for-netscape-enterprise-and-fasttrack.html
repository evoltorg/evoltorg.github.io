He can launch a virus or open an account without a password," manipulating a <i>buffer overflow</i> quirk by sending a Web address with more characters than a machine could handle.</p><p>Those seeking the Enterprise 3.6 SP 2 SSL Handshake fix can visit the details page on iPlanet <a href="http://www.iplanet.com/downloads/patches/detail_12_86.html">here</a>.</p>
