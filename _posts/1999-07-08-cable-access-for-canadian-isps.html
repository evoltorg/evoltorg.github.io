The <A HREF="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/">Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)</A> has released a <A HREF="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/ENG/TELECOM/DECISION/1999/D998_1.txt">decision</A> that Canadian cable companies must allow ISPs access to their cable infrastructure.  Hopefully this will mean faster and cheaper Internet access for Canadians! <P> ISPs in the U.S. are currently also petitioning the government to impose similar rules against American cable operators.
