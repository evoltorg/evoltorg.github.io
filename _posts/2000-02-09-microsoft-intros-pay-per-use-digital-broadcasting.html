<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> is to release a preview version  of Digital Broadcast Manager - software that enables secure downloads and  streaming of audio and video content, on a pay-per-use basis.  They see its use  as primarily within the entertainment arena, broadcasting digital music and  video, but also to deliver online training for education and business purposes. <P> Payment methods include single use, unlimited use, and time-expiration based.  Subscriptions can be implemented "by writing some minor ASP code". <P> News.com quotes Dave Fester, Microsoft's director of marketing for the digital  media division, in an article as saying "the delivery of the Digital Broadcast  Manager is a huge step in enabling service providers and partners to create  profitable business ventures with digital media." This article can be found <a  href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1545809.html">here</a>. <P> It sounds like a great idea, but actual demonstrations of their method of  implementing these secure downloads and payment remains to be seen. Please add a  comment to this article if you get the opportunity to try out this software or  hear any more information about it. Release of the product is said to be Summer  2000 (hey, it's summer here in Australia right now :p), and pricing will be  announced later. <P> Do Real or Apple have anything like this happening yet? <P> Some more information from Microsoft is available <a  href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/windowsmedia/en/solutions/dbm.asp">here</a> and developers who are interested in signing up in the DBM Developer Preview  Program should visit this <a  href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/en/solutions/dbm/Signup.asp"> page</a>. <P> Unsurprisingly, according to the FAQ on the Microsoft site, DBM will only deliver  in the Windows Media Player format... <P> <P>
