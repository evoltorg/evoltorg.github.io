Many rumours and half truths about accessibility and the law make non technical colleagues come up to us with questions about accessiibility.

<p>Accessibility and Usability are words you hear a lot more these days than </p>let's say a year ago. One reason is that companies and developers realise that </p>the hype about having a flashy web site is slowly ebbing down. Not too many </p>people are impressed any longer by designs and navigations that engulf you </p>completely - they start looking for the content and the services you offer </p>instead.</p></p><p>Another thing is the legal Sword of Damocles above the our heads - Are we </p>OK with our web site as it is or is there a chance we will be sued if we are not</p>accessible?</p></p><p>Guess what, that is not the point.</p></p><p>It is frustrating how many times you need to answer questions like:</p></p><ul></p>	<li>Do we use accessibility on project XYZ?</li></p>	<li>Can I tell the client we are A(or AA or AAA or 508) compliant?</li></p>	<li>Client XYZ wants a flash page, that's not accessible, right?</li></p>	<li>Can we tell the client that the page is 80% WAI A compliant? (What, like </p>	a wheelchair ramp with "only" three steps in it?)</li></p></ul></p><p>Accessibility is mainly about one thing: <strong>Learning to let go</strong>.</p></p><h2>Working in limbo</h2></p><p>For years we have been misusing the web - it is not a print canvas on steroids,</p>and it is not a film reel either. It is a vast, complex system of connected </p>computers, and each of them has a different user with different abilities and </p>different technology.</p></p><p>Realising this makes it rather easy for us to rationalise the following:</p></p><p>We cannot control the experience of the user. We can try, but we can never be sure.</p></p><p>This makes it rather awkward to sell products and services for the web -  no-one likes</p>to admit that what you offer might not work.</p></p><p>That's why we start reassuring ourselves, with all kind of bogus facts:</p></p><ul></p>	<li>Our users are all XYZ which means they have browser ABC with DEF enabled.</li></p>	<li>Browser XYZ has been outdated for years, no one uses that any longer.</li></p>	<li>Only geeks and weirdos disable XYZ, surely not paying customers.</li></p>	<li>The source version works like a charm, all the users need to do is disable XYZ</p>	and DEF and it'll be accessible to them.</li></p></ul></p><p>Sadly enough many a time technology is in our way, that is why the following </p>good ideas won't necessarily hold up to what they promise.</p></p><ul></p>	<li>We only use web standards, all our code validates, therefore our website works.</li></p>	<li>We added all the accessibility enhancing attributes and elements, and it is the </p>	browser's problem now.</li></p>	<li>We made sure every multimedia element has alternative content, that will be </p>	displayed when the real element can't be loaded. We did that by adding the </p>	content to the OBJECT tag.</li></p></ul></p><p>So we meant well, and what do we get?</p></p><ul></p>	<li>Browsers that implement attribute and element functionality different, or not at all.</li></p>	<li>Alternative content not showing up or showing up alongside the real content.</li></p>	<li>Browsers not resizing fonts when they are defined in a certain measure, or </p>	rendering them different.</li></p>	<li>Onkeypress getting triggered when you press non-alphanumeric characters.</li></p>	<li>Designs only looking good and working across browsers when we either </p>	sacrifice the code validity, functionality or add hacks that make us remember </p>	the bad old times of browser sniffing.</li></p></ul></p><p>In short - browsers are bad, some worse, some just slightly bad, but we cannot</p>rely on them to give the users what they need. It does not matter if one or more </p>are very good, we cannot force the user to install them.</p></p><h2>Back to the linked text pages then?</h2></p><p>So are we stuck with the two options hotly discussed in many a forum, chat </p>channel or mailing list these days? Cut down on the audience, or don't style </p>at all and let the users and their style sheets do the dirty work for us?</p></p><p>Well, no, as there is a third option:</p></p><p>Make your enhancements optional. Give the user the power to change the site </p>with a server side solution.</p></p><h2>Keeping the functionality browser-independent</h2></p><p>We started with that already. As users often simply don't know how to </p>change the size of their browser text, a lot of web sites offer widgets to </p>do that with a click on a link or an icon. Style switchers allow for skinning of</p>a web site. Portal software even allowed me as the user to click together the </p>content I want to see on the page next time I get there. Now all we need is to </p>make sure that these tools are used the right way:</p></p><ul></p>	<li>Style switchers can be used to enhance the accessibility - offer large </p>	font sizes and high contrast rather than "background image #3".</li></p>	<li>Font size changing widgets should store the setting of the user, rather</p>	than be nick-nack for each page.</li></p>	<li>The controls should be easy to find and independent of scripting, it does</p>	not help users with low vision if the resizing widget is 10x10 pixels in</p>	light grey on white.</li></p></ul></p><h2>The Learning To Let Go example</h2></p><p>Easy to say, but what happens if I don't know any server side scripting? Well,</p>you can be helped.</p></p><p>Take a look at <a href="http://ltlg.icant.co.uk/">the learning to let go example</a>.</p></p><p>This example works with PHP and cookies, and is easy to implement in your </p>sites. What it does is the following:</p></p><p>Taking the normal style switcher a step further, we offer the users to change:</p></p><ul></p>	<li>The foreground and background colours of the page content</li></p>	<li>The link colours of the content and the navigation</li></p>	<li>The font size</li></p>	<li>The width of the page</li></p>	<li>The location of the navigation - top, right, left or bottom</li></p>	<li>The location of the page - left or center.</li></p>	<li>The design to one of a number of predefined stylesheets.</li></p></ul></p><p>It provides the user with a form to change all of the above settings of the site.</p>Once these settings are entered, it stores the data in a cookie. The PHP script </p>that gets applied as a style sheet loads this cookie, and displays a chunk of </p>a predefined style sheet. By printing out the css/text header, the browser </p>considers it a normal style sheet.</p></p><p>As the maintainer of the site, you can define the name of the cookie, predefine</p>the settings and define the style sheet elements necessary for the different</p>layouts (navigation on the right, left, top or bottom - you can also only offer</p>some of these).</p></p><p>By applying the stylesheet via PHP, we can use variables in CSS, in this </p>case, the colours that were defined in the form, something developers asked for</p>for a long time.</p></p><p>This script is just an example how you can provide the users with the power to </p>change the site to their needs without giving away a lot of the styling power you </p>have as a web designer. The way it was written, it does not require you as the </p>designer to know any PHP, just CSS and HTML.</p></p><h2>But, cookies aren't accessible, you cannot take them for granted!</h2></p><p>True, but this is just an example. The code could be easily changed to store</p>the data in a database or a flat file on the server. This way you could make it </p>really independent of the user's computer.</p></p><h2>What to do next?</h2></p><p>This script is here to show you what can be done if you use a server-side </p>scripting language together with CSS to enhance your users experience, </p>and allow them to change things they need or don't want. It can be applied to </p>anything. Both sides win - you can apply your fancy design and the users can cut</p>it down to what they need or benefit from the offers you give them.</p></p><p>Other possible uses of this approach:</p></p><ul></p>	<li>Allow users to define if they want a DHTML drop down navigation or simply </p>	a list.</li></p>	<li>Allow the users to have straight text headlines or images instead.</li></p>	<li>Allow users to bookmark single pages, and give them a list of the pages</p>	they already visited, much like permanent breadcrumbs.</li></p>	<li>Allow the users to switch from multi-column to single column layout of </p>	your text.</li></p>	<li>Let the users choose if they want flash or a static replacement.</li></p></ul></p><p>Whatever you do, you do something good. You let go of the things you cannot </p>really control, and give the user the power to do so.</p></p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2></p><p><a href="http://www.joeclark.org" target="_blank">Joe Clark</a> for his article <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.naarvoren.nl/artikel/high_accessibility.html">High Accessibility - High Design</a> </p>which inspired me to create the script.</p></p><p>Various members of the <a href="http://www.webaim.org/discussion/"  target="_blank">WebAim mailing list</a></p> for testing it and asking for new features.</p>
