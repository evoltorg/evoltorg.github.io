<p>The Mozilla browser, like several other browsers on the market, uses DOCTYPE sniffing to determine how to render a page. In Mozilla's case, it either renders the page strictly, in &quot;standards mode,&quot; or more loosely -- otherwise known as &quot;quirks mode.&quot; Now Mozilla introduces something more.</p>\n<h2>Almost Standards</h2>\n<p>In the upcoming 1.01 and 1.1 releases, Mozilla will add an &quot;almost standards&quot; mode to its mix. This mode is virtually identical to the standards mode (now being referred to as &quot;full standards mode&quot;) but with one crucial change. In almost standards mode, Mozilla will not implement the CSS-2 line-height rules that causes many <a title="Evolt article by James Aylard examining the roots of this problem." href="http://evolt.org/article/Does_Netscape_6_Break_Your_Table_Layouts/17/4427/index.html"> pages with pixel-precise image layouts via tables to break apart</a>.</p>\n<h2>DOCTYPE Changes</h2>\n<p>Several DOCTYPEs that formerly triggered full standards mode will now render in almost standards mode. Those DOCTYPEs are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>XHTML 1.0 Transitional</li>\n  <li>XHTML 1.0 Frameset</li>\n  <li>HTML 4.01 Transitional with a system identifier URL in the DOCTYPE</li>\n  <li>HTML 4.01 Frameset with a system identifier URL in the DOCTYPE</li>\n  <li>One particular system DOCTYPE as a <a title="Bugzilla discussion about IBM DOCTYPEs.
