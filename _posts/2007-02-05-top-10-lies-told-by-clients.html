<p>When you're working commercially, being great at what you do is about 25%</p>of the task.  Too many times I see the sad example of someone walking in to a situation with</p>noble intentions and then getting royally screwed, because what they</p>see as an opportunity and a labor of love, the other party sees as something</p>else entirely, not at all romantic or idealized, but raw and simple.</p></p></p><p><p>You are going to be dealing with people who are unlike yourself. Their</p>motivations are their own and their attitudes are probably different</p>than yours. When you're in education, you may have tough teachers</p>and think that it can't be worse, but wait until a business person has</p>a hundred grand riding on your work! Then you will know what <q>demanding</q> means.</p></p></p><p></p>This list wasn't meant to make anyone crazy or paranoid, but is</p>designed to inject some reality into the fantasy.</p></p></p><p><h2>1. <q>Do this one cheap (or free) and we'll make it up on the next</p>one.</q></h2></p><p><p>No reputable business person would first give away their work and time</p>or merchandise on the hope of making it up later. Can you imagine what</p>a plumber would say if you said <q>come in, provide and install the</p>sink for free and next time we'll make it up when we need a sink.</q> You</p>would be laughed at! Also the likelyhood is that if something important</p>came along, they wouldn't use you.</p></p><p><h2>2. <q>We never pay a cent until we see the final product.</q></h2></p><p><p>This is a croc, unless the person is leaving the door open to cheat</p>you out of your pay. Virtually every profession requres a deposit or</p>incremental payment during anything but the smallest project. Once you</p>have a working relationship, you may work out another arrangement with</p>a client. But a new client should not ask you to go beyond an initial</p>meeting and, perhaps some preliminary sketches without pay on the job.</p></p></p><p><h2>3. <q>Do this for us and you'll get great exposure! The jobs will</p>just pour in!</q></h2></p><p><p>Baloney. Tell a plumber <q>Install this sink and my friend will see</p>and you'll get lots of business!</q> Our plumber friend would say <q>You</p>mean even if I do a good job I have to give my work away to get noticed?</p>Then it isn't worth the notice.</q> Also the guy would likely brag</p>to everyone he knows about how this would normally cost (X) dollars,</p>but brilliant businessman that he is he got if for free! If anyone calls,</p>they'll expect the same or better deal.</p></p></p><p><h2>4. On looking at sketches or concepts: <q>Well, we aren't sure if</p>we want to use you yet, but leave your material here so I can talk to</p>my partner/investor/wife/clergy.</q></h2></p><p><p>You can be sure that 15 minutes after you leave he will be on the phone</p>to other designers, now with concepts in hand, asking for price quotes.</p>When you call back you will be informed that your prices were too high</p>and Joe Blow Design/Illustration will be doing the job. Why shouldn't</p>they be cheaper? You just gave them hours of free consulting work! Until</p>you have a deal, <strong>leave nothing creative</strong> at the clients office.</p></p><p><h2>5. <q>Well, the job isn't <em>CANCELLED</em>, just delayed. Keep the account</p>open and we'll continue in a month or two.</q></h2></p><p></p>Ummm, probably not. If something is hot, then not, it could be dead.</p>It would be a mistake to <em>not</em> bill for work performed at this point</p>and then let the chips fall where they may! Call in two months and someone</p>else may be in that job. And guess what? They don't know you at all...</p></p></p><p><h2>6. <q>Contract? We don't need no stinking contact! Aren't we friends?</q></h2></p><p><p>Yes, we are, until something goes wrong or is misunderstood, then you</p>are the jerk in the suit and I am that idiot designer, then the contract</p>is essential. That is, unless one doesn't care about being paid. Any</p>reputable business uses paperwork to define relationships and you should</p>too.</p></p></p><p><h2>7. <q>Send me a bill after the work goes to press.</q></h2></p><p></p>Why wait for an irrelevant deadline to send an invoice? You stand behind</p>your work, right? You are honest, right? Why would you feel bound to</p>this deadline? Once you deliver the work and it is accepted, <strong>BILL IT</strong>.</p>This point may just be a delaying tactic so the job goes through the</p>printer prior to any question of your being paid. If the guy waits for</p>the job to be printed, and you do changes as necessary, then he can stiff</p>you and not take a chance that he'll have to pay someone else for changes.</p></p></p><p><h2>8. <q>The last guy did it for XXX dollars.</q></h2></p><p><p>That is irrelevant. If the last guy was so good they wouldn't be talking</p>to you, now would they? And what that guy charged means nothing to you,</p>really. People who charge too little for their time go out of business</p>(or self-destruct financially, or change occupations) and then someone</p>else has to step in. Set a fair price and stick to it.</p></p></p><p><h2>9. <q>Our budget is XXX dollars, firm.</q></h2></p><p><p></p>Amazing, isn't it? This guy goes out to buy a car, and what, knows exactly</p>what he is going to spend before even looking or researching? Not likely.</p>A certain amount of work costs a certain amount of money. If they have</p>less money (and you <em>can</em>), do less work and still take the job. But make</p>sure they understand that you are doing less work if you take less money</p>that you originally estimated. Give fewer comps, simplify, let them go</p>elsewhere for services (like films) etc.</p></p></p><h2>10. <q>We are having financial problems. Give us the work, we'll</p>make some money and we'll pay you. Simple.</q></h2></p><p></p>Yeah, except when the money comes, you can expect that you will be pretty</p>low on the list to be paid. If someone reaches the point where they admit</p>that the company is in trouble, then they are probably much worse off</p>than they are admitting to. Even then, are you a bank? Are you qualified</p>to check out their financials? If the company is strapped to the point</p>where credit is a problem through credit agencies, banks etc. what business</p>would you have extending credit to them. You have exactly ZERO pull once</p>they have the work. Noble intentions or not, this is probably a losing</p>bet. But if you are going to roll the dice, AT LEAST you should be getting</p>additional money for waiting. The bank gets interest and so should you.</p>That is probably why the person is approaching you; to get six months</p>worth of free interest instead of paying bank rates for credit and then</p>paying you with that money. Don't give away money.</p></p></p><p></p><p></p>In the end, working commercially, being great at what you do is about 25%</p>of the task. If that is the only part of the task that you are interested</p>in, do yourself a favor. Don't turn "pro."</p></p></p> </p>
