The nice folks over at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">the Mozilla project</a> have announced the release of Milestone 7. Lots of bugfixes and a more stable client overall. Download your binaries <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/index.html">here.</a> <P> Its nice to see the pace of the project picking up again, only a month between releases! <P>
