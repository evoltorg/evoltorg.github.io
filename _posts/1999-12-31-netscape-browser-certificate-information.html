<P></p>As you may know, Verisign security certificates included in some older Netscape browser</p>versions <a href="http://home.netscape.com/cms/certinfo.html?cp=hom12p3">will soon expire</a>. The ability of consumers with older browsers to have continued</p>smooth and safe online transaction experiences may be affected by the expiration of these</p>Verisign certificates. Although consumers will be able to continue to make secure</p>transactions, they will see an expiration dialog box whenever they try to access secure</p>sites.  Please note that this Verisign certificate expiration is a normal occurrence -</p>similar to that of a driver's license, which periodically expires. </p></P></p><P></p>The purpose of this message is to: </p><UL></p><LI>1.  Let you know which older versions of Netscape browsers include the expiring Verisign</p>certificates. </p><LI>2.  Provide information on easy options for your customers to upgrade their browser. </p><LI>3.  Provide you with access to a 'Toolkit' (below) to help you identify affected customers</p>and communicate with them successfully. </p></uL></p></P></p><P></p>1.  Netscape Products Which Are Affected and Are <b>Not</B> Affected: </p>Versions 4.05 and earlier of Netscape Navigator and Communicator with VeriSign</p>certificates are pre-set to expire after December 31, 1999 and need to be updated..  Newer</p>versions of Netscape Communicator are NOT affected and DO NOT need to be updated. They</p>are:  version 4.06 (released in August 1998), 4.07, 4.08, 4.5, 4.51, 4.6, 4.61 and the</p>current version 4.7.  People using version 4.06 and later do not need to upgrade to</p>version 4.7, although they are encouraged to do so as part of overall good browser</p>practices. </p></P></p><P></p>2.  Easy options for end users to upgrade to Netscape Communicator 4.7: </p>As part of the Toolkit provided with this message, you should highlight to your affected</p>customers: </p>- Free Download of Netscape Communicator 4.7 is at: </p><a href="http://dms-www1.netscape.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/mcp?p=63C0W03C0c51rrWd01200WB0mhL">http://dms-www1.netscape.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/mcp?p=63C0W03C0c51rrWd01200WB0mhL</a></p>- CD-ROM's of Netscape Communicator 4.7 are available for a small shipping and handling</p>fee at: <a href="http://dms-www1.netscape.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/mcp?p=63C0X03C0c51rrWd01200WB0mhL">http://dms-www1.netscape.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/mcp?p=63C0X03C0c51rrWd01200WB0mhL</a></p></P></p><P></p>3. Simple Toolkit to Help You Identify and Communicate with Affected Customers (see</p>Information Link): </p>- Javascript code with a 'sniffer' tool that you can place on your site that </p>determines if someone using an older Netscape browser has arrived at your secure website. </p>- A graphic image (pop-up size) that you may wish to serve up to users of the older</p>products. You may edit this graphic or substitute one of your own.
