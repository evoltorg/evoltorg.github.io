User Vision, one of Europe’s leading usability specialists, has won a place in the BBC’s Innovation Labs.  User Vision, in partnership with their associate Jonathan Marshall, is one of 40 companies to be selected from 250 applications.</p> </p>The Innovation Labs are a series of creative workshops for interdisciplinary teams of independent new media and technology companies from across England, Scotland and Wales.</p><p>User Vision has been selected to take part in the Interactive TV lab to develop a Cross Media Zoomable User Interface. </p>Users of interactive TV are wanting to better control the way they watch digital media, yet at the same time they are able to access this through an increasing number of platforms.  Furthermore Web 2.0 has transformed expectations to allow users to share and discuss media with friends.</p><p>The project will explore intuitive ways to enable this interaction and increase user engagement and enjoyment with interactive television content.</p><p>User Vision will help to develop user-centred TV screen and EPG (Electronic Programme Guide) interaction design that support choice, control and findability in an increasingly complex environment.  Jonathan Marshall’s experience with interactive TV technologies will help ensure the ideas from the Innovation Lab can be realised and are appropriate for the BBC’s audience.</p><p>Chris Rourke, User Vision MD explains:  “It is a fantastic honour for us, to be working with some of the country’s leading new media and vision specialists.  Making interactive TV easy to use is a massive challenge and one that we are eager to meet.”</p><p>Jonathan Marshall comments: "It is an exciting challenge to bring together my skills of designing and building interactive services with UserVision's Usability experience."</p><p>Professional creative technologists, application designers, software developers and interactive media designers, working across both future media & vision platforms pitched ideas in response to briefs set by New Media & Vision commissioners across the BBC.</p> </p>Ten projects in each of four regions across the UK have been selected to attend a five-day Lab. During the Lab from March 10 - 14, User Vision will work with BBC commissioners and other mentors to develop its idea and prepare a final pitch. On the last day of the Lab, the ideas will be pitched to the BBC commissioners for further development funding.</p><p>The Labs are aimed at independent media companies with a track record of producing innovative new media & vision products. As the BBC aims to commission further development of prototypes selected for the Labs, it expects projects to come from established teams with the capacity to deliver projects at scale.</p><p>For more information about all the Scottish Region winners please go to: http://open.bbc.co.uk/labs/blog/2008/02/scotland_lab_places.php</p>
