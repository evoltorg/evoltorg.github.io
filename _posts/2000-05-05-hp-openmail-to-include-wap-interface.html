 <P><a href="http://www.hp.com">Hewlett-Packard</a> </p>today announced OpenMail Anywhere/WAP, a Wireless Application Protocol</p>(WAP) interface for <a href="http://www.hp.com/go/openmail">OpenMail 6</a>, one of the leading business</p>messaging/collaboration solutions for Linux and Unix systems.</p>OpenMail is the only major business messaging solution currently available through</p>a WAP connection anytime, anywhere. </p></P></p><P></p>Using OpenMail Anywhere/WAP, mobile OpenMail users can now access the</p>same corporate e-mail that they use at their desktops, including</p>Microsoft(R)Outlook, Netscape Navigator, Lotus cc:Mail and Qualcomm</p>Eudora. Users can access OpenMail's wireless Web service through</p>WAP-enabled phones.</p></P></p><P></p>OpenMail Anywhere/WAP is certified with the latest WAP phone and WAP</p>gateway from Nokia. It is also certified with <a href="http://www.phone.com">Phone.com</a>'s Up.Link 3.1</p>gateway and UP.Browser 3.1. This means that OpenMail is already</p>compatible with the majority of Internet-ready handsets being sold</p>worldwide. In addition, OpenMail will be certified later this year with</p>WAP phones from Ericsson and the TANTAU Wireless Internet Platform. Work</p>is also ongoing with third parties to certify Phone.com's HDML handset</p>browsers, which are widely distributed by wireless carriers (HDML is</p>similar to WAP).</p></P></p><P></p>The fact that you don't have to use a different email address to check your email on your phone is a big plus in my book. Anyone else have experience with email on phone's or PDA's?</p></P>
