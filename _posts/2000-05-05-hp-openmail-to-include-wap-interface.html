 <P><a href="http://www.hp.com">Hewlett-Packard</a> \ntoday announced OpenMail Anywhere/WAP, a Wireless Application Protocol\n(WAP) interface for <a href="http://www.hp.com/go/openmail">OpenMail 6</a>, one of the leading business\nmessaging/collaboration solutions for Linux and Unix systems.\nOpenMail is the only major business messaging solution currently available through\na WAP connection anytime, anywhere. \n</P>\n<P>\nUsing OpenMail Anywhere/WAP, mobile OpenMail users can now access the\nsame corporate e-mail that they use at their desktops, including\nMicrosoft(R)Outlook, Netscape Navigator, Lotus cc:Mail and Qualcomm\nEudora. Users can access OpenMail's wireless Web service through\nWAP-enabled phones.\n</P>\n<P>\nOpenMail Anywhere/WAP is certified with the latest WAP phone and WAP\ngateway from Nokia. It is also certified with <a href="http://www.phone.com">Phone.com</a>'s Up.Link 3.1\ngateway and UP.Browser 3.1. This means that OpenMail is already\ncompatible with the majority of Internet-ready handsets being sold\nworldwide. In addition, OpenMail will be certified later this year with\nWAP phones from Ericsson and the TANTAU Wireless Internet Platform. Work\nis also ongoing with third parties to certify Phone.com's HDML handset\nbrowsers, which are widely distributed by wireless carriers (HDML is\nsimilar to WAP).\n</P>\n<P>\nThe fact that you don't have to use a different email address to check your email on your phone is a big plus in my book. Anyone else have experience with email on phone's or PDA's?\n</P>
