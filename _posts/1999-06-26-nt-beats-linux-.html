The revised "Mindcraft" tests are done and NT has beaten Linux across the board - one benchmark giving NT/IIS a 4166 requests/sec win to RedHat's 1842 requests/sec. Three Microsoft employees were on hand with three Linux techs to keep things fair, and while the results weren't quite like those of the original (and undoubtedly unfair) tests, they're sure to provoke arguments everywhere.</p><p>Arguments aside, the future will be interesting: on one hand, we have the Linux community coding frantically and talking of a rematch, while on the other Microsoft is preparing Win2k.</p><p>The results from both NT and Linux were impressive enough (1800+ requests/sec is one damn busy server), but we can expect further product enhancements from both camps whatever happens.</p><p>Here are the results at ZD's <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,1015266,00.html">PC Week</a>.
