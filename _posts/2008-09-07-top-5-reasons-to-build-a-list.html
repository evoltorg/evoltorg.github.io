If you're feeling a bit besieged by all the talk out there of building a list as an internet marketer, then allow us to take this chance to explain the top five reasons why building a list needs to be one of your top priorities...\nTop Five Reasons To Build A List:\n• To Regain Lost Sales - When you build a list of leads using a clutch page on your website, you have a powerful opportunity to recapture potential customers who click away without making a purchase. By capture these visitors' contact information, you can begin building a relationship with them that can sooner or later lead them back to your site to make a purchase.\n• To Build Future Profits - When you build a list, especially if you build it the right way, you are creating a future source of income. As your subscribers come to know you through the valuable content emails you send, they will also come to respect and trust your judgment and know-how. The more they trust you, the more you will be able to recommend products to them (either of your own making or affiliate programs you promote) and see purchases start to roll in. Many marketers have built such an wonderful relationship with their lists, that all they need do is tell their subscribers "Go buy xxxx", and people will flock to the sales pages - often crashing servers in the process!\n• To Increase The Value Of Your Business - Another great reason to build a approachable list is to increase the value of your business. Let's say you create websites for a living, and can build them up with great content and a small subscriber base. With a responsive list of buyers attached to a fastidious site, you can sell, or 'flip', the site for much more than if the site came without a list.\n• To Help You Create Better Products - Another great reason to build a good list is to improve your abilities as a marketer and product creator. When you've built a good relationship with your list, you can ask for their feedback on all of the various aspects of your business. This includes everything from finding people willing to evaluation a new product you've just finished, to asking for people's advice on what they'd like to learn from you.\n• To Establish Your Authority - Last but not least, building a list allows you to build your own standing as an expert in your field. If you offer your readers quality advice and tips in each and every email, pretty soon they'll be blogging about you and telling their friends. And since word of mouth is still the number one form of advertising, building that clout is vital to your success.\nThere you have it - the top five most popular reasons to start building your own email marketing list.
