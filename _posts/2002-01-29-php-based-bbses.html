excerpt: "Need a BBS for your website written in PHP? If so, you\'re in luck. There are several good ones to choose from."

<p>For many websites, a user forum is a necessity. For non-commercial sites, they provide a way for users to communicate with one another, and for many commercial sites, they are a good way to provide customer service. </p></p><p><p>I recently had to choose one for my newest website. Since the hosting server is Unix-based and I've become a big PHP fan, I looked only for <abbr>BBS</abbr>es written in PHP. I found five <abbr>BBS</abbr>es written in PHP. Three are open source. The other two are modestly priced. All of them make use of MySQL for storage.</p></p><p><p><strong>Phorum</strong> (<a href=http://www.phorum.org>www.phorum.org</a>)</p>I actually have some experience with this particular <abbr>BBS</abbr>. I've installed it on two different websites. Installation is quick and relatively painless, and it's easy to customize, too. </p></p><p><p>I added a feature to the board which allows users to subscribe to the board by e-mail. Users simply type their e-mail address into a form, and a script appends that address to a list of e-mail addresses. When a user posts to the board, the script that enters the post into the database also emails it to the list of e-mail subscribers.</p></p><p><p>I've also written a module for phpWebSite that queries the Phorum database and displays a list of Phorum topics on phpWS pages.</p></p><p><p><strong>PHPbb</strong> (<a href=http://phpbb.com>phpbb.com</a>)This one seems to be the favorite of the PHPNuke crowd. I don't have any experience with this one, but in surfing around some of the sites that use it, I must say that I like the way it looks. One thing I like is that there's a website devoted solely to hacks for PHPbb- <a href="http://phpbbhacks.com" target="_new">phpbbhacks.com</a>.</p></p><p><p>I recently tried installing this on one of my sites, but because PHP is running as a CGI program there rather than an Apache module, it wouldn't run right. I had to use Phorum after all.</p></p><p><p><strong>XMBForum</strong> (<a href="http://www.xmbforum.com">www.xmbforum.com</a>) I don't like the item layout much, but this board has a feature that the others lack: the ability to attach files, including graphics. You can, for example, upload a graphic which is your signature and appears on every post you make. You can also mark up your posts with html-like tags to get certain formatting effects and send private messages to other users. I don't know if it's included with the download, but it has a nice FAQ.</p></p><p><p><strong>UBBThreads</strong> (<a href="http://www.infopop.com">www.infopop.com</a>) This software costs about $250 for the PHP version. I was hired to install and customize this software for a client. They liked it better than Phorum, even though they had to pay for it. </p></p><p><p>The company planned on using the board for customer support, and they wanted to require that users register and be approved before they were given a login. This was relatively easy to do, as the coding of the <abbr>BBS</abbr> was very professional and almost self-explanatory. </p></p><p><p>This software also has a more finished look to it, but I'm not sure that characteristic was worth paying for. A Perl version is also available.</p></p><p><p><strong>vBulletin</strong> (<a       href=http://www.vbulletin.com>www.vbulletin.com</a>)</p>I really know nothing about this software. I just found it by accident while reading another forum. It's not free, but like UBBThreads it is not very expensive.</p>
