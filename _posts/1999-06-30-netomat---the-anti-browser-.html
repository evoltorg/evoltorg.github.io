<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/20473.html">Wired</a> has an article about Netomat, a non-linear Web browser which can make the net more interesting, and even more confusing. It sounds wanky, but amusing and might be worth a download for the curious. <P></p>In the same way that a DJ can produce music by mixing samples, Netomat apparently pulls content from sources on the net, producing a mixture of JPGs, text/html, etc. Navigation is done more by keyboard than mousing around. The author, who works for IBM during the day, plans an open source future for his <a href="http://www.netomat.net/">browser</a>. <P></p>If they expect me to include this in my "cross-browser" testing... <P>
