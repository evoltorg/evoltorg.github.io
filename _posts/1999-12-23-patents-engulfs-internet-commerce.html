More oil in the fire of why patents or lawyers harm the free development of the Internet and worldwide trade and commerce, not to mention the free exchange of information. <P></p>The article is a bit old, and can only be accessed after registration, but it is a very interesting read. <P></p>Quote from it: "All over the Internet, from the most popular search engines to  personal home pages, are buttons that offer to send users to  an online store where they can buy books or music or other  merchandise. Hundreds of thousands of sites have added  these links because they earn commissions if any of their  users click on them and then buy something.  <P></p>This week, those sites suddenly found themselves at risk of  violating a patent just granted to a New York company called  LinkShare Corp. That patent gives LinkShare the right to  block anyone from using such an arrangement for links  between sites with commission payments.  <P></p>The number of patents related to the Internet has been  skyrocketing. .. At the end of the day, Internet sites may be forced to pay  royalties to use some of the most popular features. And in  some cases, patent holders may keep some of the best  ideas to themselves, the way Xerox, for example, blocked  competitors from offering plain-paper copiers for years.
