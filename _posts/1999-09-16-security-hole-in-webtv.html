From the 'When it rains, it pours' department, there has been a security hole found in Microsofts WebTV product.<P></p><p>The problem has the potential to expose user and subscriber ID's, as well as information about your WebTV account and other private information.</p></P></p><P></p>The email program that comes with WebTV and some of WebTV's mailservers were to blame for the glitch, which MS says it has fixed.</p></P></p><P></p>The full story can be <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-120447.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif?st.ne.fd.gif.e">found over here</a> at news.com.</p></P></p>I'm probably the 50th person to say this, but this timing is really bad for MS, with three security holes in its products in the same amount of weeks, MS is hurting its already tarnished reputation when it comes to security and privacy.
