<p>\nPut it in your Palm&reg; and alert your next of kin. Following the astounding success of Evoltageddon 1 (evolticon, beervolt, whatever you want to call it - hey, I'm easy), plans have been made for yet another get-together of epic proportions.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>TheDate:</strong> Saturday, March 10, 2001\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>TheTime:</strong> There will be folks there as early as 5pm\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>TheCity:</strong> Austin, TX, US of A\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ThePlace:</strong> The Ginger Man\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The details:</strong> The Ginger Man is located at  304 West Fourth Street in Austin, TX.  If you need to call for directions or anything, their number is 512-473-8801.  More information about the Ginger Man can be found on their <a href="http://gingermanpub.com/austin/a-frame.html" title="Opens a new window to the Ginger Man web site." target="_new">web site</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's a social gathering, and all are invited.  Come meet some of the evolt.org administrators and ply them with alcohol to get the inside scoop on what we've got planned for evolt.org. Find out what the modern, well-dressed web god(des) is wearing on his/her back (or skin...).  Hang out, tell stories, attach faces to names, and make new friends.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you have any questions or comments, there's some healthy discussion on <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/mailman/listinfo/thechat" title="Find out what TheChat is and sign up! Will open in this window.">TheChat</a> about what we're up to.  \n</p>\n<p>\nIf you're going to be coming, drop a line in the comment section below so we have a rough idea of how many and who to expect. How will you recognize the evolt crew? Good question! We'll be the ones with the distinct dark t-shirts that only a web developer could love.  Hope to see you there!\n</p>
