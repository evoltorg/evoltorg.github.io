<em>Minsk, Belarus, October 13, 2006</em> - Scand is pleased to announce the release of <strong>dhtmlxGrid v.1.1</strong>, JavaScript grid component which brings Excel-like functionality on the web. Besides Ajax support, rich cell editing capabilities and client-side sorting presented in previous version, dhtmlxGrid v1.1 delivers some new functionality including <strong>cells merging</strong> (colspan functionality), <strong>freezed columns</strong>, <strong>improved cross-browser compatibility</strong> and others.  </p><p><strong>Paging support</strong></p>To decrease loading time and simplify navigation through large amount of table records, version 1.1 introduces paging support. Table data can be divided into small datasets displayed on separate pages keeping all rows in entire dataset accessible for API methods. Grid content can be loaded entirely during initial load or pages can be loaded dynamically on demand through <strong>Ajax</strong> callbacks. </p><p><strong>Ability to handle large datasets</strong></p>One more feature that helps effectively work with large tables is <strong>Smart Rendering</strong>: grid records can be retrieved from server by small chunks on demand and rendered only when they are in visible area of the grid. It's possible to proceed to any record in grid using scroll bar and work even with still unrendered records through JavaScript methods of grid. Due to this functionality, initial load time is greatly reduced.</p><p><strong>Enhanced drag-n-drop</strong></p>Drag-and-drop functionality presented earlier in version 1.0 was redesigned to provide fast performance and let users to quickly reorder grid rows. The tree structured grid extension <a href="http://scbr.com/docs/products/dhtmlxTreeGrid/">dhtmlxTreeGrid</a> provides drop-between and drop-inside capabilities which were earlier represented in <a href="http://scbr.com/docs/products/dhtmlxTree/">dhtmlxTree</a>. Now grid rows also can be drag-n-dropped into external HTML elements. </p><p><strong>Extended server-side support</strong></p>dhtmlxDataProcessor implemented in dhtmlxGrid allows grid data to be easily updated on server side. All changes made in browser can be automatically applied to a database. dhtmlxDataProcessor includes ready to use server side solutions for PHP(v.4 and 5), ASP and Ruby-on-Rails and easily can be extended to any other server side language.</p><p>In addition, grid <strong>API was extended</strong> with some helpful JavaScript methods and event handlers which make the control more flexible and customizable. </p><p>dhtmlxGrid 1.1 is available in two editions: Standard Edition and Professional Edition. The Standard edition is licensed under <strong>GNU General Public License</strong> (GPL) and can be downloaded from <a href="http://scbr.com/docs/products/dhtmlxGrid/">dhtmlxGrid Homepage</a>.
