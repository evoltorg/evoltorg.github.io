excerpt: "If you're launching a project, say to develop a tips database for a webdevelopers community you'll need some way of monitoring what you're doing, why you're doing it, who you're doing for and who's doing it. A common way of documenting this is in a Terms of Reference. Here's what you need."

<p></p>    		If you're launching a project, say to develop a &lt;tips&gt;</p>    		database for a webdevelopers site, you'll need some way of</p>    		monitoring what you're doing, why you're doing it, who you're </p>    		doing for and who's doing what. Or, in Project Manager-speak, </p>		</p></p>		<ul></p>			<li></p>			    Setting objectives</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>		    	Defining the scope</p>			</li></p>		   	<li></p>			    Establishing the strategy</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			    Deriving the work breakdown structure</p>			</li></p>		</ul></p>		<p></p>		    The most important tool for defining and monitoring this is the Terms </p>		    of Reference (TOR). This is the Project Manager's contract with the </p>		    users and with the project sponsor. It's the first point where the </p>		    project is given size, shape and direction out of the haze of </p>		    <q><i>hey, wouldn't it be cool to catalogue the &lt;tips&gt; from </p>		    thelist</i></q> to a place where you can actually start working. Some    </p>		    organisations (particularly larger ones) will make it impossible for </p>		    you to get anything done without one - it can be an essential part of </p>		    the business case required to get staff time, cash and system resources </p>		    to get your project underway.</p>		</p></p>		<p></p>		    So what would you put in your TOR? It will vary, depending on your</p>		    project, but the typical sections you'd get in most TORs are: </p>		<P></p>		<ol></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Authority and project sponsor</p>			</strong><br></p>    			This is as simple as who has asked that the project has been</p>    			carried out. In a business setting, this would be whoever is </p>                providing the money to do the work.<br>&nbsp;</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Customer</p>			</strong><br></p>			    Usually the final user of the product.<br>&nbsp;</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Objectives</p>			</strong><br></p>			    It's important that the objectives you set for the project are </p>                in line with whatever your organisation's objectives are (or at</p>                least those of the project sponsor... don't you just </p>			    <em>love</em> political games?). Your objectives should also </p>                be:</p>			<ul></p>				<li></p>				    Specific</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Measurable in terms of quality, quantity, time & cost.</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Achievable</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Readily understandable</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Consistent</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Few in number</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Supported fully by senior management, project sponsor and </p>                    users (the three constituencies of stakeholder).</p>				</li></p>			</ul></p>			<p></p>			    Of course, some of these are going to cause you problems. You </p>			    <strong>will</strong> need to make tradeoffs between time, cost </p>                and quality (the usual dictum is pick two, but smarter     </p>                compromises are usually better), working out which are the </p>                vital ones. In this industry, time to market is nearly always </p>                the key one, with cost coming in second. Guess what usually </p>                suffers..?</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Scope</p>			</strong><br></p>			    This is the biggie. Get this wrong and you'll either end up</p>			    with something which doesn't satisfy your stakeholders, solves</p>			    the wrong problems, or misses the budget/launch date. Project</p>			    Management is all about managing change, so a useful way to</p>			    approach this is in terms of what/who you'll affect by the</p>			    change. A possible outline scope for the </p>			    &lt;tips&gt; project might be:</p>			    <blockquote></p>				    A system to extract and publish &lt;tips&gt; from thelist.</p>				    Content delivery will be to thesite, other XML-accepting sites</p>                    and non-PC devices. Users will be able to search for</p>                    &lt;tips&gt; and rate them on their usefulness.</p>				</blockquote></p>			<p></p>    			This is the start of a comprehensive requirements document, </p>                which could (and often should) be developed in tandem.</p>            </p></p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Constraints</p>			</strong><br></p>			    Very similar to Scope except that it defines what's outside the</p>			    remit, and what boundaries you may not cross. These may be the</p>			    result of external forces which you can't control, such as the</p>			    development platform you're running on.<br>&nbsp;</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Costs/budget</p>			</strong><br></p>			    This section may be 100% guesstimate, but you would usually be </p>                working within a budget, so cut your cloth accordingly.<br>&nbsp;</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Resources</p>			</strong><br></p>			    This may also be guesstimate, but you should have an outline</p>			    idea of who you'll need, and what tools. You can then look at</p>			    the gaps in who and what you already have, and start looking</p>			    for sources to plug the gaps & changing your budget</p>			    accordingly. For the &lt;tips&gt project, we very clearly need</p>			    database expertise, sysadmin expertise, WAP knowledge and HTML</p>			    skill; we'll also need a database, a web application framework,</p>			    a web server and a system to run it on. Fortunately, in our</p>			    assembled team, we have (amongst others), Rudy, Dean, Dan, and</p>			    Steve with access to the system evolt.org's running on</p>                (ColdFusion & Oracle on Linux).<br>&nbsp;</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Deliverables</p>			</strong><br></p>			    These should be explicitly defined using your requirements</p>			    document, so the stakeholders have no doubt as to what's</p>			    expected. &quot;A tips database&quot; is not enough; we will be</p>			    delivering a database (or probably an extension to the existing</p>			    one), publishing tools, management tools and documentation.</p>			    There are likely to be additional interim deliverables -</p>			    prototypes, designs, this TOR, requirements document, etc.<br>&nbsp;</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Project phases and timescales</p>			</strong><br></p>			    Planning project phases and timescales lets you see the project</p>			    in more understandable components. At the stage of the 1st</p>			    iteration of the TOR, these may be as simple as</p>			<ul></p>				<li></p>				    Initiation</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Specification</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Design</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Build</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Installation</p>				</li></p>				<li></p>				    Operation and review</p>				</li></p>			</ul></p>			<p></p>			    However, this will keep your mind, the minds of your team, and</p>			    those of your stakeholders on the progress you're making,</p>			    rather than the distant horizon of project completion.</p>			</p></p>			<p></p>			    As far as dates are concerned, you'll probably only commit to a</p>			    date for the next phase - the further away a phase is, the less</p>			    knowledge you'll have of it, and it's a weather-forecasting job</p>			    where Chaotic processes affect later events quite</p>			    disproportionately.</p>			</p></p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Strategy</p>			</strong><br></p>			    This is the high-level guidance for the project team, and is</p>			    also useful for reassuring your stakeholders. You're likely to</p>			    include: </p>			    <ul></p>				    <li></p>				        Use of any particular techniques or methodologies </p>				    </li></p>				    <li></p>				        The adoption of any recognised standards </p>				    </li></p>				    <li></p>				        Relationships with other parts of the organisation</p>            <br>&nbsp;</p>    				</li></p>	    		</ul></p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Risks</p>			</strong><br></p>	    		This is where you get to be worried about the impact of what</p>	    		you're doing. What are the potential major problems</p>	    		(particularly the <a href="http://www.h2g2.com/"</p>	    		target='_blank' title='Expect the unexpected'>unexpected</p>	    		ones</a>)? What are the chances of them happening? What are</p>	    		their impact? What can be done to reduce their likelihood? What</p>	    		are the contingency plans? A risk we might consider for</p>	    		&lt;tips&gt; is what if CF for Linux doesn't get launched?</p>	    		You'll really want to think about your assumptions, as these</p>	    		are very clearly elements of risk.<br>&nbsp;</p>			</li></p>			<li></p>			<strong></p>				Roles and responsibilities</p>			</strong><br></p>			    Most projects will have natural roles for internal and external</p>			    team members. However, the key thing to tie down is</p>			    decision-making responsibility. Most evolt decisions are made</p>			    by the team (with a loose email '+1' voting system), rather</p>			    than a single individual. Your project may vary from this,</p>			    however, and is sure to need some input from your stakeholders.</p>			</li></p>		</ol></p>		<p></p>    		So there you are - that's the TOR in outline. Remember that this is</p>    		an iterative process - your TOR will be refined as you go through</p>    		the process as more information becomes available. </p>		<p>
