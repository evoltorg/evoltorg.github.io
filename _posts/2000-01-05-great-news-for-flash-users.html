<P><a href="http://www.macromedia.com">Macromedia</a> started 2000 with very good news for <a href="http://www.flash.com">Flash</a> developers.  With the announcement of the Flash 4 Print Authoring <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/open/webprinting/">Software Development Kit</a> Macromedia has opened a whole new range of possibilities for developers who want to create Web e-commerce applications with built-in printing capability.</P><P> The new SDK is available free of charge from Macromedia along with full documentation and samples for PC or Mac versions of Flash 4. This release is a good step in the direction of making Flash even more appealing than it already is and confirms my opinion that Macromedia is going the right way. The only good news that could really top this one would be the announcement of the Flash 4 SDK... </P> <P>.redstar. </P> <P>
