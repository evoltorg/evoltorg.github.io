excerpt: "Client in need of a webmaster for servicing existing ASP web application."
---
<p>DesignsByWG.com needs a programmer to maintain/expand an existing web application based on ASP/Access/Win2k.  The web application was built by an outsource company in India, but for logistical reasons the client needs someone who is US-based, preferably in the Eastern time zone.  Work will be entirely remote - experienced freelancers preferred.</p></p><p><p>This posting is for a gig, not permanent employment.  It will be an ongoing as-needed subcontractor basis.  At least 2 years experience working in ASP is required, with web-accessible work samples.  Must be comfortable working with another programmer's code.  Resume not required.  </p></p><p><p></p><a href="http://www.designsbywg.com" target="_blank">Designs by WG</a><br /></p>Phone: 1-561-615-1491<br /></p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:info@designsbywg.com">info@designsbywg.com</a><br /></p>AIM: designsbywg</p></p>
