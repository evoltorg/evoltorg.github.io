It works quite similiar as the known system from the Netscape directory.  The Go Guides are volunteers who try to catalogue the net. </P><P>\nBeta tested since July - results online since September.</P> <P>\n For someone who wants to become a known expert this is a good chance to polish one renommee. <p><a href="http://www.go.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Go</a></p> \n<p><a href="http://guides.go.com" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Go Guides</a></p>
