excerpt: "Have you been asking yourself how we strip HTML tags in comments?  Or how we create those nice code &lt;textarea&gt;s from nothing more than &lt;pre&gt; tags?  Or any of a multitude of other questions?  Well, fear not, we've tracked down Jeff Howden and held him captive until he's agreed to answer a"

<p></p>To start, here is the basic list of allowed tags in comments and articles:</p></p></p><p><dl></p> <dd>&lt;a&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;blockquote&gt;,&lt;/blockquote&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;ul&gt;,&lt;/ul&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;ol&gt;,&lt;/ol&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;li&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;dl&gt;,&lt;/dl&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;dd&gt;,&lt;/dd&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;dt&gt;,&lt;/dt&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;pre&gt;,&lt;/pre&gt; (which get converted to a textarea)</dd></p> <dd>&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;cite&gt;,&lt;/cite&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;br&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;img&gt;</dd></p> <dd>&lt;hr&gt;</dd></p></dl></p><p><p></p><strong>Can you give us a brief overview of what you've done?</strong></p></p></p><p><p></p>To answer your question, I'm using a big black box with a variable</p>speed motor attached to an alternating beater arm.  Each tag is spun around</p>within this black box by this beater arm inside a metal colander with small</p>holes of varying sizes.  Those tags not marked as safe have holes of</p>appropriate size that can be found in this colander.  Those marked as safe</p>do not have such holes.  As they're spun around, centripetal force pulls</p>them out through the hole sized appropriately for the given tag.  What's</p>left is then poured out into a baking tin sprayed with 3 in 1 oil, baked at</p>12,000 degrees kelvin for 3.4 nanoseconds and promptly stored in the database to</p>cool.  Serve chilled, neat, warm, or hellfire.  Serves an unlimited number</p>and never spoils.</p></p></p><p><p></p><strong>Wouldn't a teflon coated ceramic work better and resist corrosion?</strong></p></p></p><p><p></p>I experimented with teflon and ceramic, both together and separately.  I</p>abandoned them both for separate reasons.</p></p></p><p><p></p>I found that the sharp ends of the tags would scratch nearly all the teflon</p>coating off the colander after only one run.  This resulted in excessive</p>long term memory loss in those the final product was served to, hence the</p>temporary increase of same subject questions on thelist in a relatively</p>short period of time.</p></p></p><p><p></p>In my experiments I found that the initial torque requirements necessary to</p>bring the colander up to speed was causing undue stress on the motor due to</p>its weight.  The advantage of inertia at that point would have warranted</p>keeping it if it hadn't been so expensive, not to mention there wasn't</p>enough room in the current design of the black box, to install a set of</p>counter-action, retro-motion brakes.  without them the colander would come</p>up to speed, spin out the mash in milliseconds and continue to spin for</p>hours.  This resulted in unnecessary spilling when attempting to feed the</p>next string to process.  We were losing data bits from unpredictable spots</p>in strings until we figured that one out.  Some of the secrets of the</p>universe will never be recovered because of that mistake.</p></p></p><p><p></p><strong>What's the leverage ratio of the arm?</strong></p></p></p><p><p></p>It's actually a variable ratio leverage arm achieved by a parallel coupling</p>between the motor drive arm and the fixed arm on the beater.  Depending on</p>the thickness of the string, the arm can adjust its pitch to match.</p></p></p><p><p></p>You have no idea how much rethinking we had to do just to test this thing.</p>We had to throw all of our testing methodology out the window.</p></p></p><p><p></p><strong>Are you using needle bearings or cartridge?</strong></p></p></p><p><p></p>It's actually using something called a polymorphal-floatfit.  maybe i'll</p>write an article about that actually.  It's pretty complex.</p></p></p><p><p></p><strong>I would think there would be some concern with the possible under-torque in high-content filtering</strong></p></p></p><p><p></p>Fortunately, this device is nothing more than an object that can be</p>instantiated for any number of requests.  we even recently fitted it with an</p>attachment that would take care of its own cleanup and storage.  All you</p>have to do is install it and it does everything else automatically.</p>Unfortunately we forgot an off switch and it can be pretty protective.  So,</p>now that it's installed we're basically stuck with it.</p></p></p><p><p></p><strong>Thanks for taking the time to speak with us.</strong></p></p></p><p><p></p>Sure.  Can I go now?</p></p>
