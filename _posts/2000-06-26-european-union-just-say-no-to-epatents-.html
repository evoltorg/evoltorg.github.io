<p>&nbsp;As there are tendencies in Europe to</p>  use Software patents much the same</p>  way as it in the USA,</p>  there are interesting campaigns now</p>  starting against patenting of Software</p>  of Europe. </p></p><p>  <p></p>  Do your best to support the issue,</p>  or did you know there is a patent</p>  at Quicksort for lists of cursors for</p>  sorting of objects (5175857), or</p>  the use of a diagram to show the length</p>  of sessions in a calendar tool (5247438).</p></p><p>Or the patent for a texteditor do use</p>  different colors to show changes from one</p>  version to the next (4965765).</p></p><p>If you want to use one of this rather simple program</p>  routines or similar in your own applications, you have</p>  to expect to pay license fees, or worse, have to chancel</p>  your application.</p></p><p>The number in clauses are US patent numbers you can</p>  check at <a href="http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/patquery" target="_blank">http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/patquery</a></p>  if you do not believe it.</p></p><p>This madness is proposed to be imported to Europe</p>  during this year- so it is time now to do something against</p>  it.</p></p><p>This also concerns publishers of Open Source Software.</p>  Learn more about this topic and what you can do at <a href="http://www.freepatents.org" target="_blank">http://www.freepatents.org</a> </p></p></p><p>There is also another petition to save Software</p>  Innovation in Europe:</p></p><p></p>  NO ePATENTS</p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p>  A Petition to Save Software Innovation in Europe<br></p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p>  EuroLinux Alliance<br></p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p>  petition.eurolinux.org<br></p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p>  The Eurolinux Alliance of European<br></p>  software companies and Open Source associations launches a</p>  pan-European petition to keep Europe free from software patents. </p></p><p> This petition is receiving growing support from commercial software<br></p>  publishers in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,</p>  Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden.</p></p><p></p>  Together with this petition, the EuroLinux Alliance publishes &quot;The</p>  EuroLinux File on Software Patents&quot; a document which lets everyone</p>  understand in less than 15 minutes the dangers posed by software</p>  patents. This document, based on thorough economical and legal</p>  analysis, exhibits clear evidences of the negative impact of software</p>  patents on innovation and competition. It shows that the European</p>  Commission has mainly taken into account the point of view of patent</p>  attorneys, dominant players in the electronic industry and recent</p>  rulings of the United States Patent Office, leaving away the point of</p>  view of innovative European software publishers. Also, the decision</p>  making process at the European Commission does not seem to implement</p>  provisions of the Rome Treaty calling for a high level of competition,</p>  consumer protection, public safety, industrial growth and cultural</p>  diversity in Europe.</p></p><p></p>  This campaign comes as a response of IT associations and software</p>  companies to recent ideological speeches from the Directorate for the</p>  Internal Market at the European Commission, which indicate that the</p>  European Commission will likely issue a directive to extend the scope</p>  of European patents to software and intellectual methods, completely</p>  ignoring the concerns raised by leading software companies, refusing</p>  to study the general economic effects of software patenting, and even</p>  rejecting without explanation arguments raised by other General</p>  Directorates of the European Commission.</p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; </p></p><p></p>  Previous campaigns on this subject had quickly reached more than</p>  10,000 signatures from software developers. This petition is just the</p>  beginning of a new campaign based on (hopefully not yet patented)</p>  advanced e-techniques to let volunteers participate in the lobbying</p>  effort. It will be formally filed within three months at the European</p>  Parliament.</p></p><p></p>  Read the full press release, sign the petition, get more information at:</p><p>The EuroLinux Petition for a Software Patent Free Europe -<BR></p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://petition.eurolinux.org" target="_blank">http://petition.eurolinux.org</a><br></p>  The EuroLinux File on Software Patents -<br></p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://petition.eurolinux.org/reference" target="_blank">http://petition.eurolinux.org/reference</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>  <br></p>  Intellectual Property Law in a Global Economy, the hidden patent</p>  agenda of the European Commission -<br></p>  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.eurolinux.org/news/agenda/" target="_blank">http://www.eurolinux.org/news/agenda/</a></p>
