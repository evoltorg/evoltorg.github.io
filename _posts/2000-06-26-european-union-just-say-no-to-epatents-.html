<p>&nbsp;As there are tendencies in Europe to\n  use Software patents much the same\n  way as it in the USA,\n  there are interesting campaigns now\n  starting against patenting of Software\n  of Europe. </p></p><p>  <p>\n  Do your best to support the issue,\n  or did you know there is a patent\n  at Quicksort for lists of cursors for\n  sorting of objects (5175857), or\n  the use of a diagram to show the length\n  of sessions in a calendar tool (5247438).</p>\n<p>Or the patent for a texteditor do use\n  different colors to show changes from one\n  version to the next (4965765).</p>\n<p>If you want to use one of this rather simple program\n  routines or similar in your own applications, you have\n  to expect to pay license fees, or worse, have to chancel\n  your application.</p>\n<p>The number in clauses are US patent numbers you can\n  check at <a href="http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/patquery" target="_blank">http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/patquery</a>\n  if you do not believe it.</p>\n<p>This madness is proposed to be imported to Europe\n  during this year- so it is time now to do something against\n  it.</p>\n<p>This also concerns publishers of Open Source Software.\n  Learn more about this topic and what you can do at <a href="http://www.freepatents.org" target="_blank">http://www.freepatents.org</a> \n</p>\n<p>There is also another petition to save Software\n  Innovation in Europe:</p>\n<p>\n  NO ePATENTS\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\n  A Petition to Save Software Innovation in Europe<br>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\n  EuroLinux Alliance<br>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\n  petition.eurolinux.org<br>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>\n  The Eurolinux Alliance of European<br>\n  software companies and Open Source associations launches a\n  pan-European petition to keep Europe free from software patents. </p>\n<p> This petition is receiving growing support from commercial software<br>\n  publishers in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,\n  Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden.</p>\n<p>\n  Together with this petition, the EuroLinux Alliance publishes &quot;The\n  EuroLinux File on Software Patents&quot; a document which lets everyone\n  understand in less than 15 minutes the dangers posed by software\n  patents. This document, based on thorough economical and legal\n  analysis, exhibits clear evidences of the negative impact of software\n  patents on innovation and competition. It shows that the European\n  Commission has mainly taken into account the point of view of patent\n  attorneys, dominant players in the electronic industry and recent\n  rulings of the United States Patent Office, leaving away the point of\n  view of innovative European software publishers. Also, the decision\n  making process at the European Commission does not seem to implement\n  provisions of the Rome Treaty calling for a high level of competition,\n  consumer protection, public safety, industrial growth and cultural\n  diversity in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n  This campaign comes as a response of IT associations and software\n  companies to recent ideological speeches from the Directorate for the\n  Internal Market at the European Commission, which indicate that the\n  European Commission will likely issue a directive to extend the scope\n  of European patents to software and intellectual methods, completely\n  ignoring the concerns raised by leading software companies, refusing\n  to study the general economic effects of software patenting, and even\n  rejecting without explanation arguments raised by other General\n  Directorates of the European Commission.\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p>\n  Previous campaigns on this subject had quickly reached more than\n  10,000 signatures from software developers. This petition is just the\n  beginning of a new campaign based on (hopefully not yet patented)\n  advanced e-techniques to let volunteers participate in the lobbying\n  effort. It will be formally filed within three months at the European\n  Parliament.</p>\n<p>\n  Read the full press release, sign the petition, get more information at:\n<p>The EuroLinux Petition for a Software Patent Free Europe -<BR>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://petition.eurolinux.org" target="_blank">http://petition.eurolinux.org</a><br>\n  The EuroLinux File on Software Patents -<br>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://petition.eurolinux.org/reference" target="_blank">http://petition.eurolinux.org/reference</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <br>\n  Intellectual Property Law in a Global Economy, the hidden patent\n  agenda of the European Commission -<br>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.eurolinux.org/news/agenda/" target="_blank">http://www.eurolinux.org/news/agenda/</a></p>
