The South By Southwest (SXSW) music/film/interactive festival is accepting entries for various categories in their Web Competition. <a href="http://sxsw.kdi.com/inter/web_comp.shtml" target="_new">Their site</a> describes the criteria for each award and shows past winners and good examples. They allow you to <a href="https://secure.sxsw.com/forms/web_form_1.html" target="_new">apply online</a>, and the entry fee isn't that expensive ($15 for individuals, $25 for businesses) when compared to art magazine competitions (which often carry entry fees of $100 or more). The deadline is next Monday, Jan. 10th, and the awards will be presented in Austin, TX during the fest, on March 11th.</p><p>Personally, I think evolt.org should enter in the Best Online Community category. The website and the discussion list have helped numerous people out, all over the world, and given <a href="http://www.evolt.org/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=626&catid=25">the short time</a> evolt has been around, I think we've has accomplished a lot. What do you think?
