Afilias has been allocated the responsibility of administering .info by ICANN and expects to add another 250&nbsp;000 names this week.</p></p><p><p>And it's the first major addition to the Internet's addressing system since the 1980s.</p></p><p><p>But how are companies using it? Dell has one, but <a href="http://www.dell.info/" target="_blank" title="Visit dell.info - Opens New Window">dell.info</a> simply redirects to dell.com. I'm sure that some evolters can add lists of well-used .info domains as comments below.</p></p><p><p>If you want to find out more about the .info namespace, try <a href="http://www.afilias.info/" target="_blank" title="Visit Afilias - Opens New Window">Afilias</a>, or read more about the release at <a href="http://australianit.news.com.au/common/storyPage/0,3811,2929326%255E442,00.html" target="_blank" title="Read Australian IT News Release - Opens New Window">Australian IT</a>.</p></p><p><p>At the time of publishing, there was no information on the .info release at either CNET or Wired.com.</p>
