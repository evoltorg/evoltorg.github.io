excerpt: "Web application redesign.  Looking for a wicked graphical interface designer."
---
<p></p>I am looking for someone to redesign a web application I have been developing for the past two years.  Using PHP/MySQL this application has about 15-20 front end forms and reports which breaks down to about 3-5 different layouts.  I am looking to migrate to a new design and looking for the right designer to do that for me.  </p></p><p></p>If interested, please email me at josh@efeingold.com with a link to your portfolio, your hourly rate, and where you live.  I am looking to get this kicked off right away, but if I like your design, I may be willing to wait a little while.</p></p><p></p>Thanks,</p>Josh<br></p></p>
