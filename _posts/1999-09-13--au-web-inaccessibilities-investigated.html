An investigation to be conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) is expected to submit an interim report in December this year, detailing Internet <b>in</b>accessability for older Australians and people with disabilities. <P></p>Much like the standards outlined in the United States (see this related article about making your Web site accessible by as many people as possible: <a href="http://www.evolt.org/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=381&catid=20">Accessibility: more than the right thing to do</a>) , the report may outline minimum standards that should be met when publishing information on the Internet. Both browser-related problems, and Web education and training issues will be covered. <P></p>1997 guidelines by <a href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/">HREOC</a> suggested that many sites could be breaching discrimination laws. This new report, requested by Attorney-General Daryl Williams, continues the efforts by the Federal Government to deal with Internet access for disabled Australians, and follows the funding of initiatives and research into these issues. <P></p>Read more on the situation at <a href="http://www.newswire.com.au/9909/disweb.htm">Newswire</a>. <P>
