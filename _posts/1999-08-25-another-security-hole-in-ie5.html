News.com was the first to <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,40909,00.html?st.ne.fd.gif.d">report another</a>\n security hole in IE5. <P> The problem goes back to an ActiveX control that \nshipped with IE5 that can allow a malicious webmaster to place a program on a victim's hard disk that will be\nexecuted at the next reboot. The bug can be exploited from a user opening a web page or reading an email.\n</P><P>\n <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">MS</a> has acknowledged the security hole, and says it will have a patch out within\n the week.</P>  <P>\n<I>Are bugs like this, or worse, viruses like Melissa going to be the norm as a result of tighter 'application integration'\n that MS has been touting for years?</I></p><p>\n
