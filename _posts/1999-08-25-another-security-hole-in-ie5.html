The bug can be exploited from a user opening a web page or reading an email.</p></P><P></p> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">MS</a> has acknowledged the security hole, and says it will have a patch out within</p> the week.</P>  <P></p><I>Are bugs like this, or worse, viruses like Melissa going to be the norm as a result of tighter 'application integration'</p> that MS has been touting for years?</I></p><p></p>
