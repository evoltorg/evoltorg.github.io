<p></p><strong>Title:</strong> Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web<br></p><strong>Author:</strong> Christina Wodtke<br></p><strong>ISBN:</strong>  0735712506<br></p><strong>Publisher:</strong> <a href="http://newriders.com/" target="_new" title="Opens in new window">New Riders Publishing</a><br></p><strong>Price:</strong>  US$ 29.99 (currently selling at US$ 20.99 at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904151027/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20" target="_new" title="Buy it from Amzon.com, and give evolt.org some kickback. Opens in a new window">Amazon.com</a>)<br></p><strong>Page Count:</strong> 368<br></p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> 16 October 2002</p></p></p><p></p><p>This book is full of that kind of energy that makes it hard to stop reading. </p>  You can tell that Christina Wodke takes IA as something very personal, and has </p>  placed all that passion into these pages.</p></p><p>She starts by making a solid case for IA, then proceeds to ditch the </p>        gurus and their hard rules with braveness and wit. Next, she opens her </p>        toolbox, and starts showing you an impressive set of tools which are exhaustively </p>        described, with all the secrets you need to use them effectively and great </p>        examples. It's the most practical book on Information Architecture that </p>        I've read so far.</p></p>      <p>It doesn't matter if you are new to the discipline or an experienced </p>        architect, you'll still learn lots of useful stuff. The traditional subjects </p>        of IA are presented in a refreshing point of view, and it explains subjects </p>        that nobody before had revealed, with clarity and detail. For example: </p>        best practices for developing user research, how to build a good taxonomy, </p>        a great chapter on interaction design, and all you need to know about </p>        documentation - just to mention sample topics that were particularly relevant </p>        to me.</p></p>      <p>Then she wraps it all up into an exercise project, and as if that wasn't </p>        enough the goes on to give you greats bits of advice on how to be a better </p>        professional, like how to get out of a creativity block and how to win </p>        the respect of the people you work with. Prof. Norman is best as describing </p>        it in the back cover: "what else can you ask for?"</p></p>      <p>Within the first pages she says it's a small book, I'd say that's not </p>        quite precise. She also says she's put her whole brain into this book, </p>        she surely did. So my recommendation would be: don't waste the chance </p>        to feed on a really bright brain.</p></p>      <p>She also says hello to evolt.org in the Acknowledgements page <code>:)</code></p></p><p><table border="0" cellpadding="10"></p>  <tr><td valign="middle"><a </p> href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712506/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20"><img</p> src="images/138/47554/cover.jpg"</p> border="0" alt="Book Cover"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a </p> href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712506/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20">Buy</p> it through amazon.com with a slice for evolt.org</a></td></tr></p></table>
