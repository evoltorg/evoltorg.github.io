<p>\n<strong>Title:</strong> Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web<br>\n<strong>Author:</strong> Christina Wodtke<br>\n<strong>ISBN:</strong>  0735712506<br>\n<strong>Publisher:</strong> <a href="http://newriders.com/" target="_new" title="Opens in new window">New Riders Publishing</a><br>\n<strong>Price:</strong>  US$ 29.99 (currently selling at US$ 20.99 at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904151027/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20" target="_new" title="Buy it from Amzon.com, and give evolt.org some kickback. Opens in a new window">Amazon.com</a>)<br>\n<strong>Page Count:</strong> 368<br>\n<strong>Publication Date:</strong> 16 October 2002\n</p></p><p>\n<p>This book is full of that kind of energy that makes it hard to stop reading. \n  You can tell that Christina Wodke takes IA as something very personal, and has \n  placed all that passion into these pages.</p>\n<p>She starts by making a solid case for IA, then proceeds to ditch the \n        gurus and their hard rules with braveness and wit. Next, she opens her \n        toolbox, and starts showing you an impressive set of tools which are exhaustively \n        described, with all the secrets you need to use them effectively and great \n        examples. It's the most practical book on Information Architecture that \n        I've read so far.</p>\n      <p>It doesn't matter if you are new to the discipline or an experienced \n        architect, you'll still learn lots of useful stuff. The traditional subjects \n        of IA are presented in a refreshing point of view, and it explains subjects \n        that nobody before had revealed, with clarity and detail. For example: \n        best practices for developing user research, how to build a good taxonomy, \n        a great chapter on interaction design, and all you need to know about \n        documentation - just to mention sample topics that were particularly relevant \n        to me.</p>\n      <p>Then she wraps it all up into an exercise project, and as if that wasn't \n        enough the goes on to give you greats bits of advice on how to be a better \n        professional, like how to get out of a creativity block and how to win \n        the respect of the people you work with. Prof. Norman is best as describing \n        it in the back cover: "what else can you ask for?"</p>\n      <p>Within the first pages she says it's a small book, I'd say that's not \n        quite precise. She also says she's put her whole brain into this book, \n        she surely did. So my recommendation would be: don't waste the chance \n        to feed on a really bright brain.</p>\n      <p>She also says hello to evolt.org in the Acknowledgements page <code>:)</code></p></p><p><table border="0" cellpadding="10">\n  <tr><td valign="middle"><a \n href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712506/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20"><img\n src="images/138/47554/cover.jpg"\n border="0" alt="Book Cover"></a></td><td valign="middle"><a \n href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712506/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20">Buy\n it through amazon.com with a slice for evolt.org</a></td></tr>\n</table>
