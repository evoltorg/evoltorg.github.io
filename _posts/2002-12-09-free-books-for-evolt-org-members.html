Starting with the communication ends that online media support, he moved back through design, HTML and server-side code. Then he got into running the whole show.
These days he\'s working for <a href=\"http://www-5.ibm.com/services/uk/services/bcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these people</a> as a Project Manager, and still thinks (nearly 6 years on) it\'s a hell of a lot better than working for a dot-com. In his Copious Free Time&trade;, he helps out running a <a href=\"http://www.purpur.co.uk/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloth Nappies</a> online store.
</p>

<p>Amongst his favourite things is <del><strike><a href=\"http://www.zope.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">Zope</a></strike></del><ins><a href=\"http://drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal</a></ins>, which he uses to run his <a href=\"http://www.easyweb.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">personal site</a>. He\'s starting to (re)gain a sneaking regard for ECMAscript since the arrival of unobtrusive scripting.</p> 

<p>He\'s been a member of evolt.org since the very early days, a board member, a president, a writer and even contributed a modest amount of template code for the current site. Above all, he likes evolt.org to do things because it knowingly chooses to do so, rather than randomly stumbling into them. He\'s also one of the boys and girls who beervolts in the UK, although the arrival of small children in his life have knocked the frequency for 6.</p>

excerpt: "How you can get your hands on a free copy of the Glasshaus book: \"Usability, The Site Speaks for Itself\" this holiday season."

<p></p>Over 2002, evolt.org has built up quite a friendship with publishers <a href="http://www.glasshaus.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">glasshaus</a>. A growing number of glasshaus titles have had evolters as authors and technical editors, and evolt.org was one of the case studies featured in <a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904151035/evoltorg02-20/ref=nosim" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Usability, The Site Speaks for Itself</a>.</p></p></p><p></p>Our friends at glasshaus have given evolt.org some free copies of &quot;<cite>Usability...</cite>&quot; to distribute to evolt members, so here's your chance to win one of them. You've got two choices:</p></p></p><p><h2></p>Write a High Quality Article</p></h2></p><p></p>We've got three copies to give to the best articles published in December. Put all that time off over the festivities to write a killer article about the stuff you know. It can be a review, a tutorial, a commentary on the state of the web - anything that fits into the usual evolt.org categories. If you're stuck for an article structure, Spinhead's written <a href="/how_to_how_to/">a useful guide</a>.</p></p></p><p><h2></p>Give evolt.org a Christmas Present</p></h2></p><p></p>We've also got three copies to give to people who support evolt.org through donations. We'll be picking three people randomly from those who give any size of gift in December via our PayPal account. If you want to know how to do this, see Marlene's article <a href="/help_support_evolt/">Support evolt.org</a>.</p></p></p><p></p><h2>Small Print</h2></p><ul></p><li></p>You may submit as many articles as you like, but no evolt.org member will win more than one copy of the book.</p></li></p><li></p>Winners will be based on articles published and financial donations received in December 2002, and will be assessed and announced in early January 2003. The decision of the judges will be final in all cases.</p></li></p><li></p>Members of the <a href="/admin/">evolt.org content team</a> are not eligible for the article prizes.</p></li></p></ul>
