<p>I've been eagerly waiting to see the winners of this contest which allowed just anyone to submit snowboard designs online. They apparently received over one thousand submissions and have just announced the winners. <a href="http://www.monsonboards.com/contest/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window.">The winning boards look beautiful</a>.</p></p><p><p>This is a great use of the web medium, to pull together a group of designers (or, really, anyone who wanted to give it a try) through a slick website and end up with a tangible product. I'm playing next year!</p>
