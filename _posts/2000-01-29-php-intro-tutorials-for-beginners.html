<!-- <P> PHP Tutorials for Beginners  1-29-00  <P> <P> Scott Perkins  2scott@bellsouth.net 770 973-3860  Atlanta, GA  <P> <P> --> <P> I just put this together.  This is an example of  open source support  . . .  By the community in other  words. Other people have answered hundreds of my  questions so I am trying to pass something along.  <P> <P> There are about 250 - 350 posts per day on the PHP  Mail-list and about 150 per day on the MYSQL mail  list.  As a beginner I was worried that I could  not call anyone that was contractually obligated  to help me. (paid support)  <P> <P> My biggest hurdle was to comprehend how a software  package could be any good if a big company was not  backing it with billions of dollars revenue and  thousands of employees.  <P> <P> Amazing but true, there are more people world  wide willing to give their efforts and share in  the pride of development and excellence than any  big company can hire.  <P> <P> Look at Apache server. Most widely used in the world, and free.   This must cause nightmares to company management trying to compete.   How can you? Can't make it cheaper. Can only try to  make it  better.  Can't do that either when the workforce is much  larger and adopts a religious attitude instead of a 9 - 5 attitude.  <P> <P> The other "most" amazing thing is the abundance of "free"  code from the thousands of other developers.   Want to do something.  Probably someone else has already done it.   Borrow the code and make changes or enhancements and pass  it along.  Mind Boggling!  <P> <P> One last amazing thing.  The manual is available on  line to update by the world users. As such it is  ne of the most complete you will ever see.  If you do  not think something is clear, submit a clarification  with example in your own words!  <P> <P> This is a collection of URLs for  prospective PHP developers exposed  to PHP for the first time.  <P> <P> An attempt has been made to order  the below listed resources with an  increasing level of complexity beginning with  the simplest and easiest to understand.  <P> <P> If you have some recommendations after  reviewing these regarding changes  of order because you found one to  be either very easy or very difficult to understand,  please let me know at  <a href=mailto:2scott@bellsouth.net>2scott@bellsouth.net</a>. <P> <P> Elementary Intro and Review of PHP  <br><a href=http://www.php.net/tut.php3>http://www.php.net/tut.php3</a> <P> <p> PHP/MySQL Tutorial Overview by Graeme Merrall   <br><a href=http://www.hotwired.com/webmonkey/databases/tutorials/tutorial4.html>http://www.hotwired.com/webmonkey/databases/tutorials/tutorial4.html</a> <P> <p> "Beginners guide to PHP and MySQL"  <br><a href=http://www.weberdev.com/index.php3?GoTo=ViewArticle.php3?ArticleID=22>http://www.weberdev.com/index.php3?GoTo=ViewArticle.php3?ArticleID=22</a> <P> <p> PHP review slideshow by PHP creator "excellent"  -  NETSCAPE only  ??-  <br><a href=http://php.net/als99/>http://php.net/als99/</a> <P> <p> PHP Intro review By Adam Trachtenberg  and David Sklar  <br><a href=http://www.builder.com/Programming/PHPIntro/?dd.bu.bb.0805.03>http://www.builder.com/Programming/PHPIntro/?dd.bu.bb.0805.03</a> <P> <p> PHP, MySQL, and Images (used car website)  by Willim Samplonius   <br><a href=http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/User/>http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/User/</a> <P> <p> PHP Introduction by W.J.Gilmore  <br><a href=http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/Introduction/>http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP/Introduction/</a> <P> <p> PHP Demos -  List of basic examples with code of PHP usage.      <br><a href=http://www.grmi.org/~www/phpexamples/demo_main.phtml>http://www.grmi.org/~www/phpexamples/demo_main.phtml</a> <P> <p> So you want to use a database in your site?
