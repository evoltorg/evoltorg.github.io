<a href="http://www.statmarket.com/">Statmarket</a> reports that Internet Explorer (mostly versions 4 and 5) is dominating the browser market, giving Microsoft 75% - a nice advantage over Netscape, which has a 25% grasp.</p><p>Apparently, it's getting these stats via trackers on Websidestory sites: 31 million pageviews is a decent base for testing, so they cannot be too far off.</p><p>Yet again we ask ourselves: "Will Netscape 5 ever arrive? and will it match IE5?" Mozilla might be a wonderful concept, but until Netscape 5 is released for download to everyday users, available on magazine coverdisks and handed out on ISP welcome CDs, Mozilla will hardly effect the stats.</p><p>In many ways, Netscape 4 is a perfectly decent browser, but mindshare effects marketshare, and with Netscape/AOL not having released a significant browser in a long time, people will really start to notice and think of them as stale and incompetent.</p><p>On the other hand, as workers of the web, we'll still have to design cross-browser Web sites regardless. There will always be enough users of Netscape, Neoplanet, Opera, etc, to warrant designing for everyone. 50%, 75%, 87%? It's not really going to matter who has what percentage of the market - as long as there are at least 5% or so "others" out there, we will be forever on our toes...
