<p> It appears that <a href="http://www.macromedialcom">Macromedia</a> has released Dreamweaver 3. </p> <p> After a quick overview of the new features, I'd say it looks promising. It's got some nice tools for cleaning up MS generated HTML, will do in-line image maps, has more tools for collaborative work (including a place to keep development notes), keeps a history file (!), and uses XML as its custom menu and shortcuts file type. </p> <p> It's available for a free trial, and will be shipping in mid-December. </p> <p> More information is available at:<br> <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/</a>. </p> <P>
