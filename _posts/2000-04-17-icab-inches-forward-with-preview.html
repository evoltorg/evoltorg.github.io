The German browser developers responsible for the tiny Mac browser, <a href="http://www.icab.de/" target="_new">iCab</a>, have posted a preview of version 2.0. This preview fixes a few bugs, and adds bookmark features allowing you to import and export from Internet Explorer and Netscape. It also adds a feature similar to that of GetRight - handling downloads and enabling users to resume downloads which have been aborted by a lost connection.</p><p>JavaScript support has been extended, but is incomplete. However, the developers promise that the final release will have full JavaScript and CSS support.</p><p>You can download the 1.1MB preview for <a href="http://www.marie-jonna.de/icab/iCab_Pre2.0_English_PPC.sit" target="_new">PPC</a>, or <a href="http://www.marie-jonna.de/icab/iCab_Pre2.0_English_68k.sit" target="_new">68K</a> CPUs.</p><p>German and Japanese versions of the preview can also be <a href="http://www.icab.de/download.html" target="_new">downloaded</a>.
