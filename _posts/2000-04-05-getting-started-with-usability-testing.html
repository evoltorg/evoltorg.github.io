<p>The best way to get started in usability is getting your hands dirty. Yes, people, that means testing.</p></p><p>Now, many web designers have never actually seen any users using their sites. If you're one of them, prepare for a bit of a shock. You'll probably find people can't use them, especially if there's functionality involved (forms, etc.). So go ahead, do some testing.</p></p><h2>How to do user testing:</h2></p><p>There are a few important rules and steps to follow when doing user testing:</p></p><ol></p><li>Get a person who fits the user profile for the site. Don't get someone who has worked on it, don't get a geek. Get a real person (off the streets if you have to). Try to get someone that's as close as possible to the intended users of the site.</li></p><li>Sit them down in front of a computer, give them the URL, and tell them a small scenario, like: "I'm testing this CV site, imagine you're a person looking for a job and try to enter your CV." Also tell them to think aloud, especially when they're wondering about something.</li></p><li>Then: shut up. Don't speak. Do not utter a word!</li></p><li>Sounds easy, but see if you actually <i>can</i> shut up.</li></p><li>Watch them use the site. If they ask you something, tell them you're not there. Then shut up again.</li></p><li>Start noting all the things you're gonna have to change.</li></p><li>Afterwards ask them what they thought.</li></p></ol></p><p><p>Easy, isn't it? You'll be surprised at the results, and what's even cooler, you can now put "usability testing" on your CV.</p></p><p><p>Finally, here are some links. I'm not giving all of them, just the top sites you just <b>must</b> visit, if you haven't already.</p></p><p><p><a href="http://www.useit.com" target="_new">useit.com: Jakob Nielsen's Website</a><br></p>The grandfather of usability, Jacob Nielsen has been writing his monthly AlertBox for years. An obligatory read.</p></p><p><a href="http://www.webword.com" target="_new">WebWord.com</a><br></p>Daily links by John Rhodes that have to do with usability. Read this and you'll be all up to date.</p></p><p><a href="http://world.std.com/~uieweb/index.html" target="_new">User Interface Engineering</a><br></p>These guys have some fantastic articles. The research is all well done and well explained, you'll be sure to learn some interesting things here.</p></p><p><a href="http://www.usableweb.com/" target="_new">Usable Web</a><br></p>Hundreds of links.
