<p>Internet.com announced today that it has acquired <a href="http://xml101.com</p>" target="_blank" title="Visit site">XML101.com</a>, <a href="http://asp101.com</p>" target="_blank" title="Visit site">ASP101.com</a>,  and <a href="http://4guysfromrolla.com</p>" target="_blank" title="Visit site">4guysfromrolla.com</a> today. Internet.com now owns and operates a network of about 150 websites related the the Internet industry.</p></p><p><p></p>Interesting to see the continuing trend of independant Web Development sites being snapped up and consolidated by larger companies. I have to wonder aloud if this type of consolidation is good or bad for the Web Development community as a whole. A couple of the more well known Development sites have fallen by the wayside after they've been bought out in a similar fashion by larger companies, and I'd hate to see that happen to good sites like xml101.</p></p></p>
