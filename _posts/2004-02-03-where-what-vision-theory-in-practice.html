<h2>Understanding the Where and What vision systems helps with better </p>  visual design:</h2></p><p>In my <a href="/article/Where_What_Vision_Systems_and_Visual_Design/22/60261/index.html">first </p>  article about the Where and What vision systems</a> (defined by Margaret Livingstone, </p>  a neurobiologist, in her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0810904063/evolt02-20/ref=nosim" title="Buy it at Amazon">Vision and Art: The Biology of Seeing</a> (Margaret </p>  Livingstone, David H. Hubel, ISBN 0810904063)), I wrote about the differences </p>  between the two vision systems, and I made a strong claim: By learning about </p>  the vision systems and their differences, you'll be able to do more effective </p>  visual design.</p></p><p>This article puts that theory to work.</p></p><p>I've taken my own website, and analyzed it for Where/What balance. Using what </p>  I learned from the analysis, I made some changes to my site's title and navigation </p>  graphics. The result is a more effective page design, with a small investment </p>  in time and effort. And the work involved becomes an addition to my experience </p>  as a visual artist.</p></p><p><h3>How can Where/What analysis help the designer?</h3></p><p>Whether designing or redesigning, the designer works in a recursive loop: doing </p>  work, viewing it, critiquing it, working out changes to make, then back to the </p>  original work to apply the changes, and so on. You don't want to be stuck in </p>  recursion mode forever, and you want your final work to be effective. The objective </p>  nature of Where/What analysis can help you break out of the design loop, and </p>  make sure your work is communicating with viewers the way you intend it to.</p></p><p>If you have a problem with an existing design, Where/What analysis often gives </p>  you the hidden key to your design problem. It also gives you an approach </p>  for developing a solution. And it's a tool that lets you recheck your </p>  redeveloped design to make sure it's working. It gives you a level of </p>  solid confidence about your design decisions that's a welcome counterbalance </p>  to the otherwise subjective nature of design. </p></p>Finally, if you need to sell an employer or site owner on a particular design </p>of your own, Where/What analysis can be used to show why an old design doesn't </p>work and your new one does. </p><h2>A real-world example: my own website</h2></p><p>When I did a couple of bits of digital illustration recently, I featured a </p>  large thumbnail of one on my site's main page, but the new illustration made </p>  my site's design look &quot;off&quot; somehow. Also: I often feel driven by </p>  changes in the world (including seasonal shifts) to modify my website's look. </p></p></p><p>With a design problem of my own making, and midwinter having generated an impatience </p>  for springtime in any form, I was motivated to do a redesign.</p></p><p>In my redesign project, I had two goals: To resolve the visual disharmony that </p>  a new illustration created on my site, and to shift my site's look a little, </p>  in honor of the upcoming spring season. </p></p><p><h3>Creating an inadvertent design problem:</h3></p><p><img src="images/15977/60270/v30cbeforeprob.gif" width="340" height="255" border="1" hspace="12"> </p></p></p><p>Before I added the new illustration to my site's main page, the page looked </p>  like the screenshot above. The page was designed to allow the eye to move </p>  from the branding in the top left corner, diagonally down and right to the main </p>  page content. The page elements had a good balance between Where features </p>  (mainly high contrast and sharp edges) and What features (color, texture, details </p>  and apparent depth) that captured a viewer's attention, and held it for a while.</p></p><p>The next screenshot, below, shows the page with the new illustration in place. </p>  You'll see that adding the new illustration has messed up the page's visual </p>  dynamic.</p><p><img src="images/15977/60270/v30cafterprob.gif" width="340" height="255" border="1" hspace="12"></p></p><p>Comparing the two screenshots without thinking about the Where and What vision </p>  systems, we'd say that the new illustration is too strong. It pulls the </p>  eye down to the bottom right of the page, and keeps it there.</p></p><p>How can we fix this? My questions grew. Should I remove the illustration? Make </p>  it smaller? Is the problem that it's too square? Is that big apparent curve </p>  holding the viewer too strongly? Is it the dog's face? What can I change? What </p>  if I like the illustration as-is? Should I change the branding area instead, </p>  making it stronger to balance the illustration? If so, how should I make it </p>  stronger? Wouldn't making it stronger create a new imbalance on the page?</p></p><p>Yow! It was time for a Where/What analysis. The analysis would tell me what </p>  was really wrong, and help me figure out how to fix it.</p></p><h3>Doing the Where/What analysis:</h3></p><p>Below is a table of possible Where and What vision system features:</p></p><p><table class="data" cellspacing="0"></p>  <tr> </p>    <th>The Where vision system sees large </p>      shapes and movement fast, and fatigues quickly.</th></p>    <th>The What vision system </p>      sees things slowly, processes details, and is long-lasting and resilient.</th></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td><strong>The Where vision system is triggered by:</strong></td></p>    <td><strong>The What vision system is triggered by:</strong></td></p><p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td>High contrast</td></p>    <td>Low contrast</td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td>Edges</td></p>    <td>Soft value shifts</td></p><p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td>Large shapes</td></p>    <td>Details</td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td>Angles</td></p>    <td>Curves</td></p><p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td>Sharpness</td></p>    <td>Textures</td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td>Apparent movement</td></p>    <td>Apparent depth</td></p><p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td><strong>Where vision system special features:</strong></td></p>    <td><strong>What vision system special features:</strong></td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td>Is 100% colorblind</td></p>    <td>Sees color</td></p><p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td>Is used to determine who close things are, </p>      and and how fast things are moving, thus telling people WHERE something </p>      they're looking at is.</td></p>    <td>Is used to recognize details, including </p>      facial recognition, thus telling people WHAT something they're looking at </p>      is.</td></p>  </tr></p></table></p><p><p>Taking an inventory of the new illustration's Where and What qualities, I found:</p></p><p>Attention-getting Where features: The illustration has large, high-contrast </p>  shapes, and some sharp edges. These are very Where, and draw the viewer's eye </p>  down to the new illustration right away.</p></p><p><p>Attention-holding What features: The illustration has texture, color, curves, </p>  low-contrast areas, and a face. These are very What, and hold the viewer's gaze </p>  long after the initial attention grab (achieved by the illustration's Where </p>  features) has fatigued.</p></p><p><h3>Looking at the Where/What analysis more deeply, to develop a solution:</h3></p><p><img src="images/15977/60270/causeofprob.gif" width="340" height="255" border="1" hspace="12"></p></p><p>The Where/What analysis of the new illustration showed it had both strong Where </p>  and strong What features.&nbsp; Overall, it had the strongest combined Where/What </p>  features of anything on the page. Close-up snips of the branding area and the </p>  new illustration show this more clearly. Notice that the illustration (bottom </p>  snip) has significantly more large shapes and high-contrast, which are strong </p>  Where features, as well as more value shifts, detail, texture, curves and that </p>  cute little face, all strong What features. This is why it competes so strongly </p>  with the logotype graphic. And even in the snips graphics above, even though </p>  the snip of the branding area partially overlays the snip of the new illustration, </p>  it's the new illustration that draws and holds attention best. </p></p><p>Because the new illustration engages both of the viewer's vision systems so </p>  strongly, attention is captured by the new illustration and never released to </p>  the rest of the page. It's hard for the casual viewer to pay any attention to </p>  the site's branding and rest of the page content.</p></p><p>(In a grayscale version of the snips graphic, below, you can see each element's </p>  Where qualities more easily.&nbsp; When you view in grayscale, there's no color </p>  to excite the What vision system, so it's easier to see Where features.)</p></p><p><img src="images/15977/60270/causeofprobgs.gif" width="340" height="255" border="1" hspace="12"></p></p><p><p>My site's original design was done with the Where/What vision systems in mind. </p>  The original page focus is the branding area in the top left of the page, consisting </p>  of a logotype and an illustration of a horse (designers are workhorses, you </p>  know!). The logotype and branding illustration have large shapes, sharp edges, </p>  angles and high contrast. These features made it the most Where area of the </p>  page, so it would get attention first. The color of the logotype and its background, </p>  and the texture, detail, curves and color of the horse illustration, were What </p>  features that were deliberately introduced into this area of the design to make </p>  it less Where. I wanted viewers to see the logotype first, and stick around </p>  long enough to read it, too. The Where vision system fatigues very quickly. </p>  To hold attention on a Where element, you must add What features to counterbalance </p>  the element's Where qualities. By creating graphic with a combination of strong </p>  Where/What features, I ensured that the branding area would become the page's </p>  main focus.</p></p><p>All this planning was undone by the intended well-balanced strengths of the </p>  new illustration, which communicates strongly and directly with both the Where </p>  and What vision systems.</p></p><h3>The solution:</h3></p><p>So what's the solution? The source of the problem is the strength of both Where </p>  and What features in the new illustration, vis-&agrave;-vis the original branding </p>  graphic.</p></p><p>I don't want to change the illustration. My only option is need to turn my </p>  attention to the branding area, specifically the logotype and its background. </p>  Also, I don't want to spend a lot of time fixing this problem. That means I </p>  decide there'll be no changes to shapes, sizes or positions of the original </p>  logotype graphic slices.</p></p><p>I turned back to my Where/What knowledge to assist in developing my solution. </p>  I figured I could rebalance the page by adding stronger Where features to the </p>  logotype, to enhance its basic attention-getting qualities. But I knew that </p>  if I did this, I'd run a strong risk of making it so strong that people would </p>  see it and run the other way. So, as well as giving the logotype more Where attention-getting </p>  qualities, I'd probably need to enhance its What attention-holding qualities, </p>  to give it a good balance so people would stay long enough to read the logo, </p>  just as in the original.</p></p><p>Remember this key to good design: Too many Where elements grab attention, </p>  then lose it. Too many What elements may never have the chance to grab </p>  attention long enough to hold it. You need both!</p></p><p>Below are snips and a screenshot that show how the solution worked out.</p></p><p>  </p><p><img src="images/15977/60270/v30csolutiondtls.gif" width="340" height="255" border="1" hspace="12" vspace="6"></p></p><p>The logotype was made higher-contrast, and a block of warm transparent color </p>  in back of the logotype was removed. High contrast and less color create stronger </p>  Where, attention-getting, qualities. </p></p><p>The increase in Where had to be balanced by reducing the logotype font size, </p>  and adding a fine, colored texture in back of the logotype. Texture and more </p>  color create stronger What, attention-holding qualities.</p></p><p>The logotype and its illustration were now rebalanced. But, when the now-stronger </p>  branding area was seen against an already strong navigation block, it was clear </p>  that together they were too Where. The navigation block had its font size reduced, </p>  and the font color lightened to reduce contrast. This improved the What qualities </p>  of the navigation block, and created a better Where/What balance for the branding </p>  and navigation area together.</p><p><a href="http://www.windyhilldesign.com" target="_blank"><img src="images/15977/60270/v30csolution.gif" width="340" height="255" hspace="12" border="0" alt="See the Where/What-developed solution as a live page." title="See the  Where/What-developed solution as a live page."></a></p></p><p>Overall, these small changes completely rebalanced the entire page, and worked </p>  well on other pages on the site that had not been otherwise changed. In addition, </p>  when a warm color block was replaced with a textured green, and the size of </p>  the logotype font was reduced and its color darkened, the site stepped into </p>  a kind of spring dress, with cooler colors and more delicate elements. It took </p>  about 90 minutes to do the analysis, make the changes, and publish the results.</p></p><p>When you first starting thinking about how the Where and What vision systems </p>  experience your designs and how you can best communicate with them, you'll have </p>  to do a bit of depth-thought and explicit analysis. Over time, you'll integrate </p>  your awareness of these issues into your general design skills, and incorporate </p>  Where/What knowledge into your active work intuitively. Whether you're just </p>  starting to think about these two vision systems, and how humans process what </p>  they see, or you're farther along in understanding how these vision systems </p>  work, grappling with these issues will help you design with more effective results.</p></p><p><!-- Content and graphics copyright 2004 </p>  Heather Quinn, http://www.windyhilldesign.com, WindyHill </p>  Design, All rights reserved -->
