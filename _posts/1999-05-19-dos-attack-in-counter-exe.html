A denial of service exists in counter.exe version 2.70, a fairly popular webhit counter used on the Win32 platform with web servers such as IIS and</p>WebSite Pro. <P></p><p>1) When someone requests :</p>http://no-such-server-really/scripts/counter.exe?%0A this will create an</p>entry in counter.log of a blank line then a ",1" . If the person then</p>refreshes their browser and requests it again you get an Access Violation in</p>counter.exe - the instruction at 0x00414c0a referenced memory at 0x00000000.</p><p>2) When someone requests:</p>http://no-such-server-really/scripts/counter.exe?AAAAAover-2200-As you get a</p>similar problem - though not a buffer overrun.</p><p>Whilst in a state of "hanging" all other vaild requests for counter are</p>queued and not dealt with until someone goes to the console and okays the AV</p>messages. Added to this memory can be consumed if the page is continuosly</p>requested.</p><p>Thanks to David Litchfield for the heads up
