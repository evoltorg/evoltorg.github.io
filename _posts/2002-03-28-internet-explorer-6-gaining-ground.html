<p>According to <a href="http://www.statmarket.com/" title="StatMarket (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">StatMarket</a>, Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 has a 34% share of the browser market, which is the second most popular browser version behind its predecessor, Internet Explorer 5.  The various versions of Netscape have fallen to under 7% from 12% before IE 6's release.</p></p><p><p>However, as has been mentioned before, both <a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/refer_from_ie6_article/1/22549/index.html" title="Is Netscape the Browser for the Next AOL?">here on evolt.org</a> and <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-868921.html" title="News.com Article (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>, if AOL, which owns Netscape, switches its userbase from using Internet Explorer as its built-in browser to Netscape 6, there could be a sudden, serious increase in the usage of Netscape 6.  Subscribers to AOL make up almost 15% of internet users, according to StatMarket.</p></p><p><p>More information about this:</p></p><p><ul></p><li><a href="http://www.statmarket.com/cgi-bin/sm.cgi?sm&feature&week_stat" title="StatMarket Report (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">StatMarket Featured Statistics</a></li></p><li><a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-869412.html" title="News.com Article (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">News.com Article</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article/0,,3_999091,00.html" title="InternetNews.com Article (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">InternetNews.com Article</a></li></p></ul>
