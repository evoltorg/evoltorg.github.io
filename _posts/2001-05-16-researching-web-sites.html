excerpt: "Describes a technique on researching your competitors web sites to help you design your own."
---
<p>This article describes a technique that you could use to help you research </p>        web sites. Researching web sites to see what your competition is up to </p>        is cheaper than market research, doesn't take too long and can give you </p>        a general overview of the current trends on the web. <br></p>        I've used this - it works. Give it a try.</p></p>      <h2>Step 1.</h2></p>      <p>Find as many web sites whose goals and/or purpose are similar to those </p>        of the web site you're working on.</p></p>      <p>If you use a search engine to find these sites, stop reading here and </p>        go and bookmark as many as you can. Then come back and finish reading </p>        this - it's important that you don't read the next paragraph in this article </p>        before looking at these web sites.</p></p>      <p></p></p>      <p></p></p>      <p></p></p>      <p><br></p>        No, I said go away and search for those sites.</p></p>      <h2></h2></p>      <p></p></p>      <h2>Step 2.</h2></p>      <p>Great, here's what I didn't want you to see before you searched for those </p>        sites:</p></p>      <p><br></p>        Note down all the keywords you used to search for these sites.</p></p>      <p>Hopefully, you've subconsciously saved yourself a lot of work. The top </p>        five or six words you've used to search for your site should give you </p>        a starting point when you insert your keywords into your meta-tags. I </p>        didn't want you to think about your keywords while you were searching </p>        as this could have biased your opinion of what to search for. As a side </p>        note, you should do some usability testing and ask a sample of your target </p>        audience to search for your web site (it doesn't matter if it's online </p>        or not - you're only going to note down which words they typed into the </p>        search engine). Back to the article&#8230;</p></p>      <h2>Step 3.</h2></p>      <p>Have a look through all the web sites you've found/selected to look at </p>        and jot down a few notes about what you think of them. Here are some pointers </p>        to help you:</p></p>      <ul></p>        <li> First impressions</li></p>      </ul></p>      <p>Write down first impressions - did you find the whole thing easy to use? </p>        Were you frustrated by the site? Did you stay longer than what you should </p>        have done? Did you wander off track because something interesting caught </p>        your eye? Did you think &quot;what?&quot; and leave straight away?<br></p>        You only get one shot at a first impression so try to jot down as much </p>        as possible.</p></p>      <ul></p>        <li> Design</li></p>      </ul></p>      <p>Dog's bollocks or pig's ear? Like it? Hate it? Didn't notice it? Did </p>        you say &quot;Wow!&quot;? Did you say &quot;Urgh&quot;? Simple, clean-looking, </p>        cluttered, messy, horrendous? Professional looking? Amateurish? My 12 </p>        year old son could do better?</p></p>      <ul></p>        <li> Does it work?</li></p>      </ul></p>      <p>Plagued by broken links? Does it work on your browser? On your Gran's </p>        ageing copy of Netscape 2? Does the page render properly? Does that fancy </p>        Flash animation load up? Tried it on a Mac yet? Go on, give it a shot; </p>        you'll be surprised by the results.</p></p>      <ul></p>        <li> Content</li></p>      </ul></p>      <p>Did you find what you're looking for? Is the information you expected </p>        to be on the site actually on the site? Is there too much info? Too little? </p>        Is it clear? Is the language (tone of voice) correct for the target audience? </p>        Is it in the relevant place? Is it titled correctly?</p></p>      <ul></p>        <li> Navigation</li></p>      </ul></p>      <p>Can you find the navigation elements? Do they work? Are they consistent? </p>        Do they jump around the page? Is there too much choice? Too little choice? </p>        Do you know where you are in the site at all times? Is there a &quot;safety </p>        net&quot; link back to the homepage on every page? Are the link titles </p>        descriptive enough? Are they obscure? Are they too long-winded?</p></p>      <ul></p>        <li> Functionality</li></p>      </ul></p>      <p>Which features on the site really worked? Which features got in the way? </p>        Any pointless gimmicks? Useful tools? Did you play around with a feature </p>        for an hour? Did you enjoy it? Did you skip it because you didn't know </p>        how it worked? </p></p>      <ul></p>        <li> Usability</li></p>      </ul></p>      <p>Did you find the site easy to use? Did everything on the page make sense? </p>        Did you feel you were always in control? Did you have to randomly click </p>        everywhere in the hope that something would take you to another page? </p>        Was the interface intuitive? (i.e. was it obvious from first glance or </p>        did you have to think about how it worked?)</p></p>      <ul></p>        <li> Overall feel</li></p>      </ul></p>      <p>Well, did you like it or not? Did it appeal to you? Anything you hated? </p>        Loved? How many people have you sent the link to?</p></p>      <h2>Step 4.</h2></p>      <ul></p>        <li>Make notes</li></p>        <li>Write as much or as little as you like</li></p>        <li>You can do it one site at a time or include all of the sites you've </p>          looked at</li></p>        <li>Make it informal</li></p>        <li>Send it (electronically preferably - it's easier for everyone to add </p>          their comments) to other members of your team</li></p>        <li>Send it to other teams if possible</li></p>        <li>Let people go through the sites and add comments to yours</li></p>        <li>Have a discussion (either through the document or face to face - do </p>          it at the pub if you prefer)</li></p>        <li>Write down every point in the discussion no matter how insignificant </p>          it may seem<br></p>          If you have any ideas or suggestions on how you would have done things </p>          differently, write them down</li></p>        <li>Share your thoughts and suggestions</li></p>        <li>Let other people comment on them. (A good tip is to have people write </p>          their comments in differently coloured text, or different fonts if you </p>          are planning to print it out on a black and white printer.)</li></p>      </ul></p>      <h2>Step 5.</h2></p>      <p>Now, leave it for a day or two. Get on with your work. Take a few days </p>        off, visit your cousins down south.</p></p>      <h2>Step 6.</h2></p>      <p>Go back to the document, read through all the points. Visit the web sites </p>        again to refresh your memory and to see examples of what people are referring </p>        to.</p></p>      <p>Make bullet points of everything which people liked or disliked. Make </p>        a note of any suggestions. Have a look at other web sites people may have </p>        referred to.</p></p>      <p>You should now have something that will give you ideas on how to improve </p>        your own web site.</p></p>      <h2>Step 7.</h2></p>      <p>Do the same exercise as above but this time on your own web site.</p></p>      <h2>Step 8.</h2></p>      <p>Now, take the lists of bullet points, compare them and write a set of </p>        recommendations for the web site you're working on. What you're doing </p>        here is looking for trends which users will identify with. You should </p>        also see what works and what doesn't. Learning by your mistakes is great </p>        but learning by your competitor's mistakes is cheaper.</p></p>      <p>What you do with these recommendations can depend on how your company </p>        or department works. You may be writing these guidelines purely for your </p>        own team to follow. If you need to justify a design decision to your client </p>        (whether internal or external), you could refer to the web sites used </p>        in your research. That way they can see how a design decision has been </p>        implemented and whether it works or not.</p></p>      <p align="center">---</p></p>      <p>Sources: Experience.</p></p>      <p>This article was first published on my brand spanking new <a href="http://www.ia-uk.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="ia-uk opens in other window">IA site<a/></p>
