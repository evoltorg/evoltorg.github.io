excerpt: "tion of Shopping. Be it your friends, your spouse, your children, your mom, your colleague or even your boss. Shopping gives people a kick, never felt and never associated with any other activity. While some would dig into their deep desires and go bizarre over their never ending wish lists, a few others would get caught up trying to prioritize what they need right now. And still others, would loose sight of their shopping budget and go extravagant with their purchases. The other few would end up trying to balance their shopping act, by trying to make wise & calculated purchases. </p><p>Shopping Application Background: </p><p>What if you could plan out your shopping, the next time you go out on a shopping spree? There are a number of solutions in the form of desktop applications or web applications that add the comfort of planned shopping, through web. After trying out all such applications, software and gizmo's, we realize there is still more that needs to be done. With this vision and the underlying needs in consideration, we did extensive research and tried to shape up a web application that makes shopping more manageable and even more fun. </p><p>Still in its 'Beta' version, the Shopping List application lets you create and manage all your shopping lists online. You can create multiple shopping lists, add items to them and assign preferred stores and relevant categories. You can also mark which of the items are most needed and if you have coupons for any. Moreover the filters help you pull out more specific shopping lists, with items that are \"Most Needed Only\" or Items assigned to the same category or available at a specific store. </p><p>The good news is that, they are accessible round the globe, being over the web! That means, you can print them, e-mail to someone or access over your e-mail, just in case you missed it back home or in that drawer at your work place. "

The Web 2.0 space since its inception, has always been surrounded amidst the controversies of information mismanagement. Though, recently there is a new dimension to it; "The Effective Management of Personal Information". Sounds displaced, ain't it? </p><p>Well, after a few initial years crammed with complaints about loss of information security, personal information theft and inappropriate usage, the web space has slowly evolved to live upto the social expectations in line of "Information Retention and Management". One example, we are closely discussing and examining is the social community space 'Infodoro'. The website has currently 2 social applications that claim making information management relatively easier to handle. To look through the nitty gritty of these applications, users can register for free at www.infodoro.com and take a plunge! But before, you go, let me walk you through their recently launched web application 'Shopping List'. </p><p>"Make Shopping Chores More Manageable & More FUN!" </p><p>Take the magic word 'Shopping' and you would see different expressions floating all around you. Anxiety, Smiles & Giggles, Panic, Excitement, Confusion, Extra terrestrial Imaginations, Hallucinations and much more!!!</p><p>Such is the addiction of Shopping. Be it your friends, your spouse, your children, your mom, your colleague or even your boss. Shopping gives people a kick, never felt and never associated with any other activity. While some would dig into their deep desires and go bizarre over their never ending wish lists, a few others would get caught up trying to prioritize what they need right now. And still others, would loose sight of their shopping budget and go extravagant with their purchases. The other few would end up trying to balance their shopping act, by trying to make wise & calculated purchases. </p><p>a) The Background: </p><p>What if you could plan out your shopping, the next time you go out on a shopping spree? There are a number of solutions in the form of desktop applications or web applications that add the comfort of planned shopping, through web.

With this vision and the underlying needs in consideration, we did extensive research and tried to shape up a web application that makes shopping more manageable and even more fun. </p><p>Still in its 'Beta' version, the Shopping List application lets you create and manage all your shopping lists online. You can create multiple shopping lists, add items to them and assign preferred stores and relevant categories. You can also mark which of the items are most needed and if you have coupons for any. Moreover the filters help you pull out more specific shopping lists, with items that are "Most Needed Only" or Items assigned to the same category or available at a specific store. </p><p>The good news is that, they are accessible round the globe, being over the web!
