We've been checking the hits on the site and the users subscribed, and it's really amazing how evolt is growing.</p>I believe that we have made an impressive example of the power of this net. Consider the fact that we have no physical office (but many), we have never met, we belong to different countries and some of us don't use English when they talk to our families - if you know what I mean.</p>This community is like a castle built on air, we started gathering our dreams, selecting them, voting. We organized a structure for our workflow, designed a logo, a site, archive system, the wonderful tip harvester, etc. </p>And finally have joined all these efforts, put this thing to work, and we have even become friends on the way.  The structure of the admin team has been very flexible, some people have left, others have joined, we got a cyclic rhythm for work, individual participation comes and goes according to the needs of "real life", giving this org a very organic feel.</p>I am really impressed by what this means, I've always liked to look at the Internet as an object of study, and this is amazing. We are proving that this net can help us build better forms of organization, of working and learning. I don't really know if there is some other project of this nature around.</p>Anyway, I really believe that all of us here at evolt (all the ones sub'ed to thelist, visiting the site) are actuelly making history, we as Web Developers are demonstrating how useful this Web can be, we are proving that communication over the Internet can be much more than information.</p>
