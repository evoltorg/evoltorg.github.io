<p>According to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/" target="_new">TheRegister</a>, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/23/20948.html" target="_new">Microsoft have released a Content Management System</a>.</p></p><p><p></p>As with many Microsoft products, this isn't a product of intensive development in Redmond - they went out and bought NCompass who had a CMS called Resolution. The big news is that they've dropped the price from Resolution's per server list price of $79,000 to $39,901.</p></p></p><p></p>Unsurprisingly, it only runs on Win2k (Resolution also ran on NT4).</p></p></p><p></p>Now while this won't actually be a major competitor to the likes of Vignette and Broadvision (Resolution wasn't either), it may herald a difficult time for lower cost CMSs (particularly in MS hosted environments) such as Mediasurface.</p></p>
