<p>There is perhaps no more level playing field in business than the </p>              Internet. It is this fact that has created millionaires from paupers. </p>              The amount of money that can be made depends of course on your industry </p>              and your products and/or services but to be sure, if it can be sold </p>              at all, it can be sold online.</p></p>            <p>While there are many methods out there for building a profitable </p>              website, from banner ads to email campaigns, by far the most cost </p>              effective over time has proven repeatedly to be search engine positioning. </p>              That major advantage search engine positioning has over other methods </p>              of producing revenue online is that once high rankings are attained </p>              and provided that the tactics used were ethical and that continued </p>              efforts are made to keep them, they can essentially hold and provide </p>              targeted traffic indefinitely. Your site will rise and your site </p>              may sometimes fall in the rankings but a solid and complete optimization </p>              of your site will insure that through algorithm changes you may </p>              fluctuate but you will not disappear.</p></p>            <p>I have been ranking websites highly on the Internet for quite a </p>              few years now and there are some essential rules that, if followed, </p>              will insure that over time your website does well and holds solid </p>              and profitable positions on the major search engines.</p></p>            <p><strong>Here are the 10 steps to higher search engine positioning:</strong></p></p>            <p><strong>Step One - Choosing Keywords</strong><br></p>              You first must choose your keywords. This is perhaps the most important </p>              step of the process as incorrectly targeting phrases can result </p>              in traffic that is not interested in your product. There are three </p>              tools that I use virtually every day to help pick the most appropriate </p>              keywords:</p></p>            <ol></p>              <li><a href="http://inventory.overture.com/d/searchinventory/suggestion/">Overture's </p>                Search Term Suggestion Tool</a></li></p>              <li><a href="http://www.wordtracker.com/" target="_blank">WordTracker</a></li></p>              <li>A Brain</li></p>            </ol></p>            <p>The last in the list is the most important. Look through the potential </p>              keyword phrases and think, "Who would be searching using that phrase?" </p>              If the answer is, "a student looking for information" then chances </p>              are it won't result in a sale. If the answer is "Someone who is </p>              looking specifically for a product I offer," then obviously this </p>              is a prime candidate as a targeted keyword phrase.</p></p>            <p><strong>Step Two - Site Content</strong><br></p>              Even before I optimize websites I like to get a good deal of new </p>              content down in order to insure that I know exactly where I'm going </p>              and exactly what I need to do to get there. Creating some of the </p>              new content before starting the optimization process can be doubly </p>              helpful in that it can reveal potential additions to your website </p>              that you may not have considered (a forum or blog for example). </p>              If you already have a site, perhaps simply sit on your back deck, </p>              sip on a coffee and image what you would do if your whole site was </p>              lost and you had to start again (other than launch into a very colorful </p>              discussion with your hosting company).</p></p>            <p><strong>Step Three - Site Structure</strong><br></p>              A solid site structure is very important. Creating a site that is </p>              easily spidered by the search engines yet attractive to visitors </p>              can be a daunting and yet entirely rewarding endeavor. To adequately </p>              structure your website you must "think like a spider" which is not </p>              as difficult as it may sound. A search engine spider reads your </p>              web page like you would read a book. It starts at the top left, </p>              reads across, and then moves down.</p></p>            <p>Priority must be given then, to what you place near the top of </p>              your page.</p></p>            <p><strong>Step Four - Optimization</strong><br></p>              Once you have your keyword targets, your content created and your </p>              site structure established you must now move on to the most obvious </p>              step, the optimization of your content. </p></p>            <p>As noted above, a spider places importance on what it reads highest </p>              on the page and so beginning with a sentence that includes your </p>              targeted phrase only makes sense. That said, stuffing in keywords </p>              in hopes that it will add weight to your page generally doesn't </p>              work. The term "keyword density" refers to the percentage of your </p>              content that is made up of your targeted keywords. There are optimum </p>              densities according to many reputable SEO's though exactly what </p>              they are is debatable. Estimates seem to range anywhere from 4 </p>              or 5% to 10% to 12% (quite a gap isn't it).</p></p>            <p>Personally, when it comes to keyword density I prescribe to one </p>              rule: put your keywords in the content as much as you can while </p>              keeping it comfortably readable to a human visitor.</p></p>            <p>Some do it first, I do it last. Regardless of when you do it you </p>              must choose your heading. At the beginning of your content you have </p>              the opportunity to use the &lt;h1&gt; tag to specify the heading </p>              of your content. This tag is given extra weight and is also an indicator </p>              to the search engine of where your actual content starts. Make sure </p>              to use your keywords in the heading but don't shy away from also </p>              adding additional words (though not too many).</p></p>            <p><strong>Step Five - Internal Linking</strong><br></p>              To insure that your website gets fully indexed you have to make </p>              sure that the spiders have an easy path through your website. Text </p>              links make the best choice as the anchor text (the actual words </p>              used to link to a specific page) add relevancy to that page for </p>              the words used to link to it. For example, if I ran a website on </p>              acne and had a treatments page I could link to it with an image, </p>              with text reading "Click for more information on how to treat this </p>              skin condition" or simply "Acne Treatments". When a search engine </p>              spider hits an image it has no idea what the image is and, while </p>              it will follow the link, it will not give any weight to the page </p>              it hits. If you use text that does not contain the keywords you </p>              are targeting you are essentially supplying the engine with the </p>              same lack of relevancy as with an image, but if you use the phrase </p>              "Acne Treatments" to link to your acne treatments page you are attaching </p>              relevancy to that page for those keywords.</p></p>            <p>There are two main ways to insure that your site gets well spidered </p>              AND that the relevancy is added. The first is to place text links </p>              on the bottom of your homepage to your main internal pages (not </p>              EVERY page, that just looks odd). The second is to create a sitemap </p>              to all your internal pages and link to it from your homepage. Both </p>              methods have advantages and disadvantages but that's a whole article </p>              unto itself.</p></p>            <p><strong>Step Six - Human Testing</strong><br></p>              So now you have your site, it's optimized and you have your navigation </p>              in place. The next step is to put it past someone who has never </p>              seen your site (and preferably who won't know how much work you've </p>              put in and tell you it's great even if it's not).</p></p>            <p>Ask them to find specific information and see how long it takes. </p>              Ask someone else to just surf your site and watch which links they </p>              click and ask them why they chose those ones. </p></p>            <p>Most importantly, find out how the content reads to them. You've </p>              spent hours working through the content at this point and are probably </p>              not the least biased on its readers. Find out how it reads to someone </p>              who has no invested interest in the site and correct any issues </p>              they may bring up.</p></p>            <p><strong>Step Seven - Submissions</strong><br></p>              I take a different philosophy than most when it cones to search </p>              engine submissions. I submit to directories (both general and topic-specific) </p>              and to a few topical search engines but for the most part I've found </p>              submitting to Google, Yahoo, MSN and the other major engines has </p>              proven to be a bit of a waste of time. The major search engines </p>              are spidering search engines, which means they will follow links </p>              to wherever they go. Simply having sites that are spidered by the </p>              major search engines linking to you will get your site found. </p></p>            <p>When I have spent time submitting my sites I have found they get </p>              picked up in about a week. When I have simply skipped this step </p>              and sought out reputable directories and other sites to get links </p>              from I have found that at least the homepage of the site gets indexed </p>              in as little as two days. </p></p>            <p>Neither will hurt your rankings but simply to make the best use </p>              of your time, seek our directories and other websites to get links </p>              from and leave the spiders to find you on their own.</p></p>            <p><strong>Step Eight - Link Building</strong><br></p>              All of the major search engines give credit to sites that have quality </p>              links pointing to them. How many is enough depends on your industry </p>              and targeted phrases. Running a search on Google the reads "link:www.yourcompetition.com" </p>              will reveal approximately how many links a competitor has.</p></p>            <p>The first place to seek links is with general and topic-specific </p>              directories. After that you may want to move into reciprocal link </p>              building. Reciprocal link building is the exchange of links between </p>              two websites. Some webmasters will simply link to any website that </p>              links back to them. I highly recommend being more particular than </p>              that.</p></p>            <p>Find websites that you believe your site visitors would genuinely </p>              be interested in and you've probably found a good link partner. </p>              You want to find links from sites that are related to yours.</p></p>            <p>There are obviously many more methods to building links than directories </p>              and reciprocal link building. Again though, this is a whole article </p>              (or more) in itself.</p></p>            <p><strong>Step Nine - Monitoring</strong><br></p>              Whether you use <a href="../../resources/tools.htm">WebPosition </p>              Gold</a> or just run searches manually by hand you will have to </p>              monitor the major search engines for your targeted phrases. Also, </p>              you will need to review your stats to see where your traffic is </p>              coming from and what search terms are being used to find you.</p></p>            <p>If a month passes and you don't see any changes then more work </p>              needs to be done. I'm certainly not stating that you should take </p>              a month off, a solid search engine positioning strategy involves </p>              constantly adding content, building links, and insuring that your </p>              visitors are getting the information they want to have and finding </p>              it as easily as possible.</p></p>            <p><strong>Step Ten - Reward Yourself</strong><br></p>              So you've done it. It's taken many, many hours of work but your </p>              rankings are doing well. What you've created is a solid position </p>              that will stand the tests of time provided that you continually </p>              revisit the above noted steps and insure that your website is always </p>              one step ahead of your competition (who have noticed you climbing </p>              and succeeding as you would notice others climbing up around your </p>              ranking).</p></p>            <p>Now it's time to turn off your computer, take your partner out </p>              (you haven't had much time for them lately) and have a great week(end). </p>              You've got a lot of work to do to maintain and build on these rankings </p>              but the hardest part is over. Congratulations!</p>
