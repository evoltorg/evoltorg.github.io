<p>I recently stumbled across an interesting PDF while checking out <a href="http://www.1099.com" target="_new">1099 Magazine</a>'s parent company, <a href="http://www.aquent.com" target="_new">Aquent</a>.  It's a detailed salary/fee guide for web professionals.</p><p>They've broken it down into various types and levels of skill, along with typical salary ranges or fee structures one might expect at each rung of the ladder.  Check it out <a href="http://www.aquentpartners.com/info/free_tools/index.cfm" target="_new">here.</a>  (You'll need to enter an email address to take a peek)</p></p><p>One nice touch:  it was designed to be read from the <i>client's perspective.</i>  A prospective client can use this guide to get a rough handle on what this type of work is going to cost them.  Web professionals can use it as a guide to structuring their fees based on their level of skill in each particular field, from serious backend work all the way up to Flash wizardry.</p></p><p>I'm curious:  what do you think of the rates themselves?  I've noticed that there still seems to be a lot of variance in what web professionals are charging for their services...</p></p>
