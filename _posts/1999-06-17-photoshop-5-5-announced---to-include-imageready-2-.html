Adobe has announced Photoshop 5.5 which sensibly includes "the power of ImageReady 2.0" among a few other new features. <P></p>Apparently 90% of ImageReady owners also owned Photoshop and wanted to see the two combined. There are no plans to release future standalone ImageReady versions - having the two of them together will be great and is what should've happened from the beginning. <P></p>It should be available in July with an estimated street price of just over US$600. <P></p>Check out this URL for details: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/photoshop/main.html">Photoshop 5.5!</a>. <P>
