<p>\nLately there has been a great deal of interest in adding Flash to \nyour everyday run-of-the-mill email so you can send it to your clients, prospects \nor newsletter subscribers. Marketing has descended from upon high and declared \nit, the small business client wants it, or an executive in management has read \nabout it. \n</p></p><p><p>\nWell, why not?\n</p></p><p><p>\nThe fact of the matter is that email HTML \nbrowsers are just not equal to their web browser equivalents. \nThis is further made complex by the wide variety of settings, \npreferences, security updates, versions, and third-party \napplications which make the user experience hard to predict.\n</p></p><p><p>\nThis is an interesting problem to contend \nwith when creating, designing and marketing your HTML \nemail. Most likely you are about to hate what I am about \nto say, however, please do not shoot the messenger.\n</p>\n                      \n<p>\nYou should never use Flash or any other rich media piece in your \nHTML email unless you absolutely know that the email client your recipient uses \ncan handle <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/java-flash-email.php">Flash \ncontent</a>. Further, you should only send Flash/rich media content to someone \nwho has requested it, or you have an agreed upon marketing relationship. The \nfirst time that I had to wait almost an hour to download what turned out to \nbe a Flash email, I was on a hotel dial up account. That one Flash email cost \nnearly $10.00 and an hour of my time.\n</p>\n  \n<p>\nNot exactly the relationship you want to \nenter into with your customers or clients.\n</p></p><p><p>\nSo if you absolutely have to send Flash \ncontent via email, here are a few tips you should remember.\n</p></p><p><h2>Do not try to control your Flash with active scripting</h2>\n                      \n<p>\nDue to the wide variety of email clients, browsers, security settings, \nupdates, and service packs installed, it is difficult to predict how a script \nwill execute against any given email client. JavaScripts can cause browsers \n&amp; Outlook 2000 to <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/java-flash-email.php">disable \nany active scripting</a> contained in an email document (there has been an increase \nin email security due to malicious scripts).\n</p>\n  \n<h2>You're better off attaching or sending a link</h2>\n                      \n<p>\nThe majority of web-based email clients (Hotmail, Yahoo!, etc.) \nwill strip out your Flash content. It \nis not uncommon to send embedded Flash content only to have the recipient open \nit in their web-based client and see \n<a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/java-flash-email.php">absolutely nothing</a>.\n</p>\n  \n<p>\nYou also cannot rely on a &lt;NOEMBED&gt; \nto provide an alternate link for the content. You will \nneed to include a text link before or after your Flash \ncontent for all Web-based recipients and those whose systems, \nISP, network security, or other variables interfere with \ntheir viewing of Flash content.\n</p>\n                      \n<p>\nBy sending your Flash content as an attachment or a link, you \ncan work around some of these limitations imposed by making the Flash content \nrender in the browser rather in your email. That way, if your recipient has \nthe plugin, they can view the Flash file.\n</p>\n  \n<h2>Make sure your files do not immediately start playing</h2></p><p><p>\nControl your content with an onClick, or \nother event. Just a nice &quot;Click here for an important \nmessage.&quot; is all you need. Allow the viewer to start \nthe presentation when they are ready. A Flash or Shockwave \npiece, which begins streaming if viewed in an Outlook \npreview window, will start a second time when the email \nis opened. This will usually cause quite a mess with the \nrecipient's sound system, not to mention distort your \nintended message.\n</p></p><p><p>\nNothing will get your Flash email deleted \nquicker than if it causes unexpected sounds to suddenly \ncome pouring loudly from the recipient's computer during \nthe workday.\n</p></p><p><p>\nThese are just a few things you should watch \nout for if you plan to design, send and expect responses \nto your Flash emails.\n</p></p><p><p>\nFlash &amp; other rich media may all be \nyear 2001 &#8212; &quot;bleeding edge&quot; for the world of \nweb browsers. Unfortunately your average HTML email browser \nseems stuck at about early 1998.\n</p>\n                      \n<h2>Additional Resources</h2></p><p><p>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/article.php?art_id=12">Uneccessary \n  Elements in HTML email</a>\n<li> <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/article.php?art_id=6">Formatting tips \n  for AOL email</a>\n<li> <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/article.php?art_id=5">Using Javascript \n  in your HTML email</a>\n<li> <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/article.php?art_id=44">Sending HTML \n  email with Entourage (Macintosh)</a>\n</ul>\n</p>
