<p></p>Lately there has been a great deal of interest in adding Flash to </p>your everyday run-of-the-mill email so you can send it to your clients, prospects </p>or newsletter subscribers. Marketing has descended from upon high and declared </p>it, the small business client wants it, or an executive in management has read </p>about it. </p></p></p><p><p></p>Well, why not?</p></p></p><p><p></p>The fact of the matter is that email HTML </p>browsers are just not equal to their web browser equivalents. </p>This is further made complex by the wide variety of settings, </p>preferences, security updates, versions, and third-party </p>applications which make the user experience hard to predict.</p></p></p><p><p></p>This is an interesting problem to contend </p>with when creating, designing and marketing your HTML </p>email. Most likely you are about to hate what I am about </p>to say, however, please do not shoot the messenger.</p></p></p>                      </p><p></p>You should never use Flash or any other rich media piece in your </p>HTML email unless you absolutely know that the email client your recipient uses </p>can handle <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/java-flash-email.php">Flash </p>content</a>. Further, you should only send Flash/rich media content to someone </p>who has requested it, or you have an agreed upon marketing relationship. The </p>first time that I had to wait almost an hour to download what turned out to </p>be a Flash email, I was on a hotel dial up account. That one Flash email cost </p>nearly $10.00 and an hour of my time.</p></p></p>  </p><p></p>Not exactly the relationship you want to </p>enter into with your customers or clients.</p></p></p><p><p></p>So if you absolutely have to send Flash </p>content via email, here are a few tips you should remember.</p></p></p><p><h2>Do not try to control your Flash with active scripting</h2></p>                      </p><p></p>Due to the wide variety of email clients, browsers, security settings, </p>updates, and service packs installed, it is difficult to predict how a script </p>will execute against any given email client. JavaScripts can cause browsers </p>&amp; Outlook 2000 to <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/java-flash-email.php">disable </p>any active scripting</a> contained in an email document (there has been an increase </p>in email security due to malicious scripts).</p></p></p>  </p><h2>You're better off attaching or sending a link</h2></p>                      </p><p></p>The majority of web-based email clients (Hotmail, Yahoo!, etc.) </p>will strip out your Flash content. It </p>is not uncommon to send embedded Flash content only to have the recipient open </p>it in their web-based client and see </p><a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/java-flash-email.php">absolutely nothing</a>.</p></p></p>  </p><p></p>You also cannot rely on a &lt;NOEMBED&gt; </p>to provide an alternate link for the content. You will </p>need to include a text link before or after your Flash </p>content for all Web-based recipients and those whose systems, </p>ISP, network security, or other variables interfere with </p>their viewing of Flash content.</p></p></p>                      </p><p></p>By sending your Flash content as an attachment or a link, you </p>can work around some of these limitations imposed by making the Flash content </p>render in the browser rather in your email. That way, if your recipient has </p>the plugin, they can view the Flash file.</p></p></p>  </p><h2>Make sure your files do not immediately start playing</h2></p><p><p></p>Control your content with an onClick, or </p>other event. Just a nice &quot;Click here for an important </p>message.&quot; is all you need. Allow the viewer to start </p>the presentation when they are ready. A Flash or Shockwave </p>piece, which begins streaming if viewed in an Outlook </p>preview window, will start a second time when the email </p>is opened. This will usually cause quite a mess with the </p>recipient's sound system, not to mention distort your </p>intended message.</p></p></p><p><p></p>Nothing will get your Flash email deleted </p>quicker than if it causes unexpected sounds to suddenly </p>come pouring loudly from the recipient's computer during </p>the workday.</p></p></p><p><p></p>These are just a few things you should watch </p>out for if you plan to design, send and expect responses </p>to your Flash emails.</p></p></p><p><p></p>Flash &amp; other rich media may all be </p>year 2001 &#8212; &quot;bleeding edge&quot; for the world of </p>web browsers. Unfortunately your average HTML email browser </p>seems stuck at about early 1998.</p></p></p>                      </p><h2>Additional Resources</h2></p><p><p></p><ul></p><li> <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/article.php?art_id=12">Uneccessary </p>  Elements in HTML email</a></p><li> <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/article.php?art_id=6">Formatting tips </p>  for AOL email</a></p><li> <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/article.php?art_id=5">Using Javascript </p>  in your HTML email</a></p><li> <a href="http://www.templatekit.com/tk2/article.php?art_id=44">Sending HTML </p>  email with Entourage (Macintosh)</a></p></ul></p></p>
