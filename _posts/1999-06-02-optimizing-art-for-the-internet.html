Artwork and photographs probably contribute the most to </p>  this particular problem. Studies have shown that a page must load in 20 seconds </p>  or less, or the visitor gets bored and goes elsewhere, probably never to return. </p>  This issue is especially critical for visitors with low end modems - and unfortunately </p>  there are plenty of such modems still in use.<br></p>  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p></p><p><strong><a name="basics"></a>Optimizing Artwork, Important Basics:</strong> </p></p><ol></p>  <li> Always save the original image separately for the inevitable later modification. </p>  </li></p>  <li> Start your images in the RGB format (Red Green Blue, as opposed to CMYK). </p>    [RGB is the default setting of many image programs.]</li></p>  <li> Convert images at the last minute to JPEG (JPG) or GIF.</li></p>  <li> JPEG - best file type for photographs.</li></p>  <li> GIF - best file type for flat color art.<br></p>    [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </li></p></ol></p><strong><a name="scale"></a>Design your images TO SCALE if at all possible</strong>, so </p>you don't get any surprises when you later reduce the image's dimensions. This </p>is especially important when you're incorporating text in your images. Reducing </p>image dimensions after-the-fact may yield unreadable text. In the very least, </p>the final images should be to scale. Having to stretch or shrink them when creating </p>web pages can result in ugly images or unnecessarily large file sizes (and longer </p>download times). <br></p>[back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p><p><strong><a name="72dpi"></a>All web images should be 72 dpi, period.</strong><br></p>  (The ONLY exception is when you need to put images up deliberately for download </p>  by your users, and your users must have high resolution pictures accessible </p>  through the web. This is a rare instance, and it involves making your users </p>  wait obnoxious amounts of time just to view the image, and further obscene amounts </p>  of time to download the image. Bottom line: Find another way to provide high-res </p>  images to your users.)<br></p>  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p></p><p><strong><a name="preferences"></a>Setting preferences properly in Photoshop </strong><i>(PS </p>  only)</i><strong>:</strong> When designing web images in Photoshop 4(+), change the following </p>  setting in your preferences... </p></p><ol></p>  <li> Under File: Preferences: Saving Files, set Image Previews to "Never Save", </p>    or at least to "Ask When Saving." </li></p>  <li> Then when saving your web image, DO NOT save an Icon, Thumbnail, or Full </p>    Size Image Preview. </li></p>  <li>In Photoshop 5(+), Under File: Color Settings: RGB Setup, select anything </p>    but &quot;sRGB&quot; - whatever else is appropriate (I chose &quot;monitor&quot;).</li></p></ol></p><p>The RGB setting of &quot;sRGB&quot; is an advanced color setting. Using it </p>  when creating web graphics will shift the color of your images - something you </p>  want to avoid! Additionally, saving an image preview merely adds "weight" to </p>  the file size, which inflates the image file size estimate. This information </p>  is stripped off when a web page accesses the file anyway, and it's more important </p>  to get an accurate file size than it is to see a preview of the image. And speaking </p>  of file size estimates... <br></p>  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p></p><p><strong><a name="accurate"></a>Getting an accurate measurement of image file size </p>  (for estimating total web page size):</strong><br></p>  You want to know the image file sizes because you want to know how long your </p>  web page will take to download.<br></p><br><strong>On a PC:</strong> Right click ONCE on the file. Select &quot;Properties&quot; </p>  from the menu that appears. The size is listed in the window that appears.<br></p><br></p><strong>On a Macintosh:</strong> Select the file (click on it ONCE) and under </p>  the "File" menu, select "Get Info". In the window that appears is "Size:" and </p>  two numbers. The number in the parentheses is the accurate file size (which </p>  can vary widely from the "on disk" number). If you ever want to bother me about </p>  the reason for the difference, go ahead, but it won't be pretty. <br></p>  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p></p><p><strong><a name="accurateps"></a>Accurate measurement of image file size and Photoshop </p>  </strong><i>(PS only)</i><strong>:</strong> The file size will be accurate for a Photoshop </p>  created image IF you've set the Photoshop preferences the way I suggested earlier. </p>  Otherwise, the file size includes preview data, and is inaccurate for web file </p>  size estimation. <br></p>  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p></p><p><strong><a name="shadows"></a>Don't use drop shadows and gradations on your artwork.<br></p>  </strong>Both tend to look ugly on low-end monitors at 256 colors, the standard settings </p>  of most computers out of the box.</p></p><ol></p>  <li> </p>    <p>Try to avoid drop shadows, especially ones with large shadow diffusions. </p>      When they are necessary, keep the drop shadows small (1 or 2 pixels out), </p>      and either don't blur the edge or blur just a tiny bit. <br></p>      <br></p>      Creating text or images with drop shadows that will be floating over a colored </p>      webpage background are another special case altogether. Have you ever seen </p>      an image with an unattractive white &quot;halo&quot; around it? That's because </p>      the image was made on a white background, then the background was made transparent, </p>      and finally placed on a colored page. In the process the &quot;edge&quot; </p>      of the image picked up some &quot;white influenced&quot; pixels around it, </p>      hence the halo.<br></p>      <br></p>      If you've got shadows you intend to float over a color, make the image with </p>      the target color in the background. You can then make the background transparent </p>      as you produce the gif, and the shadow will look more natural.</p></p>  </li></p>  <li>Gradations are a big no-no on the web, particularly subtle ones. They band </p>    like crazy on low-res screens and look REALLY ugly. Avoid them if at all possible. </p>    <br></p>    [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </li></p></ol></p><p><strong><a name="jpeggif"></a>The general rule regarding JPEG vs. GIF is this:</strong> </p></p></p><ol></p>  <li> Use JPEGs for photo-like images with lots of colors and subtle color shifts </p>    (like gradations).</li></p>  <li> Use GIFs for flat color images and line art. In most cases this will result </p>    in better looking images with smaller file sizes (but for really small photo-like </p>    images, use GIF instead of JPEG).<br></p>    [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </li></p></ol></p><p><strong><a name="palette"></a>The web-safe color palette:</strong> When designing flat </p>  color art, start with the web palette! This palette contains the web safe 216 </p>  colors which work on both PC's and Mac's. You'll want to use it because if you're </p>  designing flat color art and don't choose a web-safe color, the art may &quot;dither&quot; </p>  (get a spotty blend of colors) and look very different from what you intended. </p>  Very important, and useful for avoiding headaches later. </p></p><p>If you need the web safe palette (some programs have it already), you can get </p>  it various places (try &quot;bclut2.aco&quot; at <a href="http://www.lynda.com/files/" target="_new" title="Opens new window">www.lynda.com</a>). </p>  Another good palette resource is <a href="http://admin.evolt.org/marlene/services/netscape-216/" target="_new" title="Opens new window">here</a>. </p>  It gives you the RGB and Hex values for any web safe color you choose.<br></p>  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p></p><p><strong><a name="smallgif"></a>Getting the smallest GIF file size </strong><i>(PS only)</i><strong>:</strong> </p>  If you're using photoshop, this is an important quick trick to get the smallest </p>  GIF file size (reducing it to the smallest palette):</p></p><ol></p>  <li> Start with RGB.</li></p>  <li> Under Image:Mode change the mode to Indexed Color.</li></p>  <li> In the window that appears, select the Web palette (216 colors).</li></p>  <li> Under Image:Mode change the mode back to RGB.</li></p>  <li> Again, under Image:Mode change the mode to Indexed Color.</li></p>  <li> In the window that appears, select the Exact palette.</li></p>  <li> Under File: Export choose GIF89a. </li></p>  <li> Choose Save (or Okay, or whatever it says). <br></p>    [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </li></p></ol></p><p><strong><a name="transparent"></a>Transparent GIF's </strong><i>(PS only, but other software </p>  may be similar)</i><strong>:</strong> If you want to create a transparent color in the </p>  GIF, use the eyedropper tool in the GIF89a window to select ONE target transparent </p>  color before saving. Also, if you want to batch process a bunch of GIFs with </p>  the same colors, create an "action" to do most of it for you. I won't get into </p>  actions here (look at Photoshop help or your manual), but this can be a tremendous </p>  time saver when processing a large number (or even a small number) of images </p>  from RGB to GIF. <br></p>  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p></p><p><strong><a name="smalljpeg"></a>Getting the smallest JPEG file size: </strong>When saving </p>  JPEGs, choose 1, 2 or 3 (or &quot;low&quot;) as your compression quality. Keeping </p>  the compression low <strong>slightly</strong> erodes the quality of your images, but also </p>  greatly saves in file size. Two or three "k" (kilobytes) can make a big difference! </p>  Start saving your images at the lowest quality and work up from there, until </p>  something looks good enough for you. </p></p><p>If you're given either of the following options, follow the recommended instruction: </p>  turn off "save paths" and choose "baseline standard." "Baseline Progressive" </p>  creates JPEGs that are interlaced like GIFs, but not all major browsers support </p>  progressive JPEGs. <br></p>  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>]</p></p><p><strong>Well, that's it for now.
