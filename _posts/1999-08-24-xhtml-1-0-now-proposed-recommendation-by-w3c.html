<p>\nThe <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_new" title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</a> yesterday reclassified the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="_new">XHTML 1.0 </a>\nspecification from a working draft to a proposed recommendation.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe XHTML specification is a reformulation of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/" target="_new" title="HTML 4.0 Specification">HTML 4.0</a> specification as an XML 1.0 application, as well as three DTDs corresponding to ones defined by HTML 4.0.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom the date this entered a proposed recommendation review period until September 22, 1999, W3C Advisory Committee representatives are encouraged to review this specification.\n</p>\n<p>\nXHTML will appear very familiar to those who know HTML, since it still uses the greater-than and less-than symbols to denote markup tags as well as many familiar HTML tags and attributes. However, it introduces a number of new restrictions and features designed to make it both compatible with <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org" title="evolt.org Browser Archive">old browsers</a> that support previous HTML specifications, and compliant with XML and future generations of XML-compliant browsers.\n</p>
