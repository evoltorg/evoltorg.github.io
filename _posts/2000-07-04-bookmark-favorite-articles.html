I was just searching around the Evolt site when it dawned on me.</p><p>There are many articles that I feel are useful and ones that I would use in the future. But at the same time, I can't use each article at the moment (maybe I'm not using any PHP at the moment but will be in 2 weeks). </p><p>So wouldn't it be nifty if there was a way to bookmark favorite articles under my logged in screen name. Maybe have a section that displays "useful articles" or something of that nature that would allow me to quickly access older articles that I deamed useful for future projects.</p><p>Just a thought.
