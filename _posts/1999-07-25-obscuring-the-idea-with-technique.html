user_biog: "<p>A founder of evolt.org, Marlene (say \"Mar-lay-nuh\") currently lives in Virginia and is a web and print designer, massage therapist, photographer, artist, burner (person who attends Burning Man), dancer, activist and yogini. In years past Marlene served as evolt.org's executive director and treasurer, though she's not much involved these days. But she still encourages visitors to <a href=\"http://www.evolt.org/article/Help_support_evolt_org/9741/29298/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">give to evolt.org</a>.</p>

<p>Marlene began exploring computer-generated graphics with a purchase of the first Mac 128K in 1984. She's subsequently been involved in print design, illustration, and since 1995, professional web design and development. Her other skills are information architecture, usability testing and site management (the largest at 14,000+ pages). Additionally, she's taught seminars, has been published on <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/stories/dice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_new\">A List Apart</a>, and contributed to and reviewed a chapter on evolt.org which appears in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596000359/qid=1036701244/sr=2-1/evoltorg02-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_new\">Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, Designing Large Scale Web Sites</a>.</p>

<p>A List Apart has an excellent article on <a href= "http://www.AListApart.com/stories/execution/" target="_new" title="Opens new window">"Execution Versus Concept"</a> -- or the dangers of losing your site's message by adding too many bells and whistles. An interesting comparison to modern advertising is made. As I recall Edward Tufte stressing at a lecture, the method should be transparent, leaving the message the single focus.</p>
