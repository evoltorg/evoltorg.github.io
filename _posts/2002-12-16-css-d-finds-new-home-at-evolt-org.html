<p></p>The incredibly popular, active, and valuable mailing list devoted to Cascading Style Sheets, CSS-Discuss (css-d), has moved its hosting to evolt.org. After some brief list overlap, and a lot of server tweaking, the list opened its doors to its new home Monday, December 9.</p><p></p></p><p><p></p>Started and moderated by Eric Meyer, author of <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/books/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window.">four books on CSS</a>, css-d quickly grew to 2,500+ members and more than 50 messages a day. This load began to tax the hosting resources Eric had in place in the beginning, and so he began a search in early November to look for a new home.</p></p></p><p><p></p>The evolt.org UK branch, <a href="http://evolt.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window.">evolt.org.uk</a> was kind enough to offer server space and bandwidth, thanks to the efforts of Lachlan Cannon and John Handelaar. In particular, John had to wrestle with a particularly ornery Cobalt Raq configuration in the time-honored tradition of trying random stuff until it worked.</p></p></p><p><p></p>Advantages of the move include more control over mailing list features for the administrator, the ability to have a css-discuss domain as the list address, and, ideally, resolution of problems with members getting multiples of multiple messages. Bringing the old list archive over is just a matter of time.</p></p></p><p><p></p>The css-d mailing list is devoted to the discussion of CSS and its real-world applications. Theory is sometimes discussed, but for the most part, it's a list for practical and daily use of CSS in projects. Find out more about css-d and sign up for the mailing list at its new home, <a href="http://www.css-discuss.org/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window.">css-discuss.org</a>.</p></p>
