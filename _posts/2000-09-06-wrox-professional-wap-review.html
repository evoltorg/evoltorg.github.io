It presents a broad overview of the\nWAP standards and a detailed guide to WML 1.1 and WMLScript. There is a wide\ndiscussion of different methods for creating mobile applications and\nconverting existing web material. The book also includes a look at some of\nthe WAP enhancements we can expect to see in the near future, helping\ndevelopers plan ahead for future functionality.\n</p>\n<a name="r"></a><h2>Review:</h2>\n<p>\nWhen I initially received this book, I was sceptical that Wrox could find\nenough material about WAP development to fill 800 pages, without falling\ninto the trap of filling up with a great deal of useless side information.\nOn seeing that there were chapters covering ASP, ColdFusion and Java, I\nthought my fears were justified, but in fact the authors have managed to\navoid the problem from being too great by using the different development\nmethods to introduce different techniques a developer might need to use in\nimplementing a strong and flexible use of WAP as an alternative delivery\nchannel for online services.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe book begins with an introduction to WAP as a family of standards and\npresents the development model and the WAP Forum. It then introduces\ndifferent ways of accessing WAP content through PC based emulators or phone\nmicrobrowsers. The first section of the book then closes with an\nintroduction to WAP Gateways, which introduces the concept in enough depth\nto allow a developer to make an informed decision as to whether his company\nrequires a gateway and what benefits they might bring. As the actual\ndevelopment of gateways and PC based browsers is so rapid, this information\nmay very quickly become dated, but the central concepts should at least hold\ntrue.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next part of the book brings us into the meatiest content area, an\nintroduction to WML and WMLScript. These two core parts of the WAP\ndevelopers arsenal are well presented and should answer the majority of\nquestions anyone starting to create WAP applications might pose. Attention\nis drawn to the differences between various microbrowsers' support, but\nthere are perhaps some problems with the way this is done, which I have\noutlined below. Anyone who has developed with HTML and / or JavaScript will\nhave no problems picking up the techniques described in these chapters and\neven complete beginners should find they can develop quite complex\napplications with a little study. Because WML and WMLS are rather simple\nlanguages, they are covered in quite enough depth that most developers'\nneeds should be catered for. The final chapter in this section covers the\nsubject of useability and like many articles on the subject, should be taken\nas a set of guidelines rather than hard and fast rules. This chapter is well\nwritten though and thought provoking especially in its discussions of\ncatering to different microbrowsers and picking which functionality of an\nexisting application should be included in a WAP application.\n</p>\n<p>\nPart three discusses different methods for generating dynamic WAP content.\nIt was here I was worried that the authors may have been padding out their\nmaterial, but in fact this section contains some great tips for application\ndevelopers. It is worth taking a look through each of the chapters, even if\nit does not cover your technology of choice. The chapter on ASP for\ninstance, introduces us to common beginners issue such as sending correct\nMIME types in content headers and interacting with WML forms on the server\nside. This is followed with a look at using XML and XSLT to serve content to\ndifferent browsers. I must admit that after reading this chapter I felt I\nwas still a little in the dark about this technology - the level of\ncomplexity of the solution left me wondering whether for the majority of\nsites it wouldn't be overkill. Worth following up this subject with a deeper\nlook at the whole subject of XML if that's where your researches are taking\nyou. \n</p>\n<p>\nThere are quite a few developers here who are developing using JSP and they\nwill be pleased by a whole chapter on combining Java, XML and WAP. Once\nagain, I'm no Java expert, but the information here throws some extra light\non developing in a flexible way to serve multiple client browsers. Finally\npart three looks at ColdFusion and WAP - another extremely popular\ndevelopment environment. As someone who develops in PHP and ASP (for\ndifferent projects), I could complain that the lack of a PHP chapter is a\nproblem, but in all honesty, the techniques presented in these 4 chapters\ncover the most popular development techniques and are quite easily adapted\nto your platform of choice with only a little head-scratching! After all,\nthis is a "Programmer to Programmer" book rather than a dummies guide!\n</p>\n<p>\nThe next section focuses on "Developing advanced WAP applications". The\nfirst chapter in this section may be of use to developers who need to\nconvert a substantial amount of existing web content that isn't in a\ndatabase or similar dynamic format. It looks at several existing tools for\nconversion and how to write your own custom converter. Interestingly this\nchapter also looks at when it may be worthwhile taking this approach - a\nuseful point if we are to avoid a situation where every other WAP site is a\ncomplete clone of a static HTML site - not a very useful or desirable\nsituation. The following two chapters cover integrating WAP with email and\ndirectory services. Both cover extremely useful techniques for the portal\nbuilder and look at the subjects in surprising depth. However neither is\nlikely to be a complete solution for your needs "out of the box" and with\nthe number of suppliers starting to offer ready made solutions, these\nchapters will probably mostly be of use in small specific cases. Finally\nChapter 15 looks at Wireless security in enough depth to answer the majority\nof questions the average developer will have an provides a number of strong\njumping off points for those who require further information or more\ndeveloped solutions.\n</p>\n<p>\nPart five of this book will be both exciting and disappointing for many\ndevelopers. Here the authors take a look at the future development of the\nWAP specifications, outlining many of the groovy techniques we will be using\nin the future, but also spelling out the inevitable truth that the vast\nmajority of these features are not implemented in either the networks or the\nhandsets yet. Push, WTA and the WTAI libraries and VoiceXML are all covered\nalong with an optimistic look at what the future holds for wireless\ntechnologies. Mouthwatering stuff!\n</p>\n<p>\nThe book finishes up with an extremely useful set of Appendices, which I\npersonally would love to have in a pocket size reference version. Here are\nWML and WMLS references, WTAI libraries and more.\n</p>\n<a name="s"></a><h2>Summary:</h2>\n<p>\nI did have a couple of criticisms. The Range of different authors for\ndifferent chapters means that there are discernible style differences\nthroughout the book. It could have benefited from a slightly stronger style\nguide. One area where this was especially apparent was in the introductions\nto WML and WMLS. Tucked in amongst the descriptions of different mark-up\ntags and code functions are various comments about the inconsistent support\nbetween various browsers. As only two browsers are covered in the book,\n(Nokia SDK and UP.Simulator) these comments would have been better either\nbroken out of the main text in the form of a standard warning that this is a\nknown area of inconsistent support, or perhaps discussed in a separate\nchapter. Finally I felt that the index was awkward to use in places - the\nfirst thing I tried to look up was information about character entities.\nFinding nothing under "character" or "entities" (or even "special\ncharacters") I gave up and flicked through the book to find the info I was\nlooking for. A couple of days later I noticed that it was under "WML -\nspecial characters", which in a book about WAP struck me as rather like\nplacing information about arrays under "Perl - arrays" in a book about Perl\nprogramming!\n</p>\n<p>\nThose small niggles aside, I would recommend Professional WAP to anyone\nlooking to buy a reference for their WAP developing adventures. It provides\nall the information a developer needs to get started in all aspects of\ndeveloping mobile services. Fortunately it doesn't answer every question,\nmeaning that lists such as ours will continue to flourish! For complete\nnon-programmers, a great deal of this book will be overcomplicated. However\nthe introductory chapters covering WML and WMLS should mean that even\ncomplete beginners can produce useful content. Experienced programmers will\nfind a good coverage of techniques for extending their applications to\nmobile users. \n</p>\n<a name="f"></a><h2>Further Information:</h2>\n<p>\nProfessional WAP has a cover price of $59.99 (US), $89.95 (Can) and �43.99\n(UK).
