It presents a broad overview of the</p>WAP standards and a detailed guide to WML 1.1 and WMLScript. There is a wide</p>discussion of different methods for creating mobile applications and</p>converting existing web material. The book also includes a look at some of</p>the WAP enhancements we can expect to see in the near future, helping</p>developers plan ahead for future functionality.</p></p></p><a name="r"></a><h2>Review:</h2></p><p></p>When I initially received this book, I was sceptical that Wrox could find</p>enough material about WAP development to fill 800 pages, without falling</p>into the trap of filling up with a great deal of useless side information.</p>On seeing that there were chapters covering ASP, ColdFusion and Java, I</p>thought my fears were justified, but in fact the authors have managed to</p>avoid the problem from being too great by using the different development</p>methods to introduce different techniques a developer might need to use in</p>implementing a strong and flexible use of WAP as an alternative delivery</p>channel for online services.</p></p></p><p></p>The book begins with an introduction to WAP as a family of standards and</p>presents the development model and the WAP Forum. It then introduces</p>different ways of accessing WAP content through PC based emulators or phone</p>microbrowsers. The first section of the book then closes with an</p>introduction to WAP Gateways, which introduces the concept in enough depth</p>to allow a developer to make an informed decision as to whether his company</p>requires a gateway and what benefits they might bring. As the actual</p>development of gateways and PC based browsers is so rapid, this information</p>may very quickly become dated, but the central concepts should at least hold</p>true.</p></p></p><p></p>The next part of the book brings us into the meatiest content area, an</p>introduction to WML and WMLScript. These two core parts of the WAP</p>developers arsenal are well presented and should answer the majority of</p>questions anyone starting to create WAP applications might pose. Attention</p>is drawn to the differences between various microbrowsers' support, but</p>there are perhaps some problems with the way this is done, which I have</p>outlined below. Anyone who has developed with HTML and / or JavaScript will</p>have no problems picking up the techniques described in these chapters and</p>even complete beginners should find they can develop quite complex</p>applications with a little study. Because WML and WMLS are rather simple</p>languages, they are covered in quite enough depth that most developers'</p>needs should be catered for. The final chapter in this section covers the</p>subject of useability and like many articles on the subject, should be taken</p>as a set of guidelines rather than hard and fast rules. This chapter is well</p>written though and thought provoking especially in its discussions of</p>catering to different microbrowsers and picking which functionality of an</p>existing application should be included in a WAP application.</p></p></p><p></p>Part three discusses different methods for generating dynamic WAP content.</p>It was here I was worried that the authors may have been padding out their</p>material, but in fact this section contains some great tips for application</p>developers. It is worth taking a look through each of the chapters, even if</p>it does not cover your technology of choice. The chapter on ASP for</p>instance, introduces us to common beginners issue such as sending correct</p>MIME types in content headers and interacting with WML forms on the server</p>side. This is followed with a look at using XML and XSLT to serve content to</p>different browsers. I must admit that after reading this chapter I felt I</p>was still a little in the dark about this technology - the level of</p>complexity of the solution left me wondering whether for the majority of</p>sites it wouldn't be overkill. Worth following up this subject with a deeper</p>look at the whole subject of XML if that's where your researches are taking</p>you. </p></p></p><p></p>There are quite a few developers here who are developing using JSP and they</p>will be pleased by a whole chapter on combining Java, XML and WAP. Once</p>again, I'm no Java expert, but the information here throws some extra light</p>on developing in a flexible way to serve multiple client browsers. Finally</p>part three looks at ColdFusion and WAP - another extremely popular</p>development environment. As someone who develops in PHP and ASP (for</p>different projects), I could complain that the lack of a PHP chapter is a</p>problem, but in all honesty, the techniques presented in these 4 chapters</p>cover the most popular development techniques and are quite easily adapted</p>to your platform of choice with only a little head-scratching! After all,</p>this is a "Programmer to Programmer" book rather than a dummies guide!</p></p></p><p></p>The next section focuses on "Developing advanced WAP applications". The</p>first chapter in this section may be of use to developers who need to</p>convert a substantial amount of existing web content that isn't in a</p>database or similar dynamic format. It looks at several existing tools for</p>conversion and how to write your own custom converter. Interestingly this</p>chapter also looks at when it may be worthwhile taking this approach - a</p>useful point if we are to avoid a situation where every other WAP site is a</p>complete clone of a static HTML site - not a very useful or desirable</p>situation. The following two chapters cover integrating WAP with email and</p>directory services. Both cover extremely useful techniques for the portal</p>builder and look at the subjects in surprising depth. However neither is</p>likely to be a complete solution for your needs "out of the box" and with</p>the number of suppliers starting to offer ready made solutions, these</p>chapters will probably mostly be of use in small specific cases. Finally</p>Chapter 15 looks at Wireless security in enough depth to answer the majority</p>of questions the average developer will have an provides a number of strong</p>jumping off points for those who require further information or more</p>developed solutions.</p></p></p><p></p>Part five of this book will be both exciting and disappointing for many</p>developers. Here the authors take a look at the future development of the</p>WAP specifications, outlining many of the groovy techniques we will be using</p>in the future, but also spelling out the inevitable truth that the vast</p>majority of these features are not implemented in either the networks or the</p>handsets yet. Push, WTA and the WTAI libraries and VoiceXML are all covered</p>along with an optimistic look at what the future holds for wireless</p>technologies. Mouthwatering stuff!</p></p></p><p></p>The book finishes up with an extremely useful set of Appendices, which I</p>personally would love to have in a pocket size reference version. Here are</p>WML and WMLS references, WTAI libraries and more.</p></p></p><a name="s"></a><h2>Summary:</h2></p><p></p>I did have a couple of criticisms. The Range of different authors for</p>different chapters means that there are discernible style differences</p>throughout the book. It could have benefited from a slightly stronger style</p>guide. One area where this was especially apparent was in the introductions</p>to WML and WMLS. Tucked in amongst the descriptions of different mark-up</p>tags and code functions are various comments about the inconsistent support</p>between various browsers. As only two browsers are covered in the book,</p>(Nokia SDK and UP.Simulator) these comments would have been better either</p>broken out of the main text in the form of a standard warning that this is a</p>known area of inconsistent support, or perhaps discussed in a separate</p>chapter. Finally I felt that the index was awkward to use in places - the</p>first thing I tried to look up was information about character entities.</p>Finding nothing under "character" or "entities" (or even "special</p>characters") I gave up and flicked through the book to find the info I was</p>looking for. A couple of days later I noticed that it was under "WML -</p>special characters", which in a book about WAP struck me as rather like</p>placing information about arrays under "Perl - arrays" in a book about Perl</p>programming!</p></p></p><p></p>Those small niggles aside, I would recommend Professional WAP to anyone</p>looking to buy a reference for their WAP developing adventures. It provides</p>all the information a developer needs to get started in all aspects of</p>developing mobile services. Fortunately it doesn't answer every question,</p>meaning that lists such as ours will continue to flourish! For complete</p>non-programmers, a great deal of this book will be overcomplicated. However</p>the introductory chapters covering WML and WMLS should mean that even</p>complete beginners can produce useful content. Experienced programmers will</p>find a good coverage of techniques for extending their applications to</p>mobile users. </p></p></p><a name="f"></a><h2>Further Information:</h2></p><p></p>Professional WAP has a cover price of $59.99 (US), $89.95 (Can) and �43.99</p>(UK).
