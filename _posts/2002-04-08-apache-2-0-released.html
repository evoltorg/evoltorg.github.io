excerpt: "After five years of work, the Apache Group released version 2.0.35 of its HTTP server this weekend - the first 'Gold' release."
---
Cv 0 comes with a raft of new and improved features, including:</p></p><p><ul></p><li>Radically improved support for non-*nix operating systems such as Microsoft Windows NT/2000. Apache 2.0 no longer relies on POSIX emulation, and is instead compiled with OS-specific extensions to core code called the Apache Portable Runtime. Additionally, on Win32 the server has native Unicode support throughout.</li></p><li>Support for input and output filtering through the module API</li></p><li>Support for IPv6</li></p><li>Simplified configuration</li></p></ul></p><p>However, whilst the server is now ready for production use - indeed, on non-Unix systems, administrators are encouraged to switch as soon as possible - most administrators will be waiting for the release of compatible versions of <a href="http://perl.apache.org/" title="mod_perl homepage. Opens in a new window" target="_blank">mod_perl</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/" title="PHP homepage. Opens in a new window" target="_blank">mod_php</a> before making the upgrade. So far, neither is ready.</p></p><p>The new release (and version 1.3.24) does have a few known bugs, notably with cookie handling and buffer sizes in mod_proxy.  If cookie-handling with proxypass directives is important to you, you should stick with 1.3.23 for the time being :-) </p>
