Despite all the hype about <cite>the mobile internet</cite> [sic],\npeople who actually have actually <strong>used</strong> WAP services\ngave the current state of technology a resounding thumbs-down.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/wap/" title="View the summary.\nYou can download the full report for $18 ">a field study of WAP users</a>\ncarried out in London by <a href="http://www.useit.com/"\ntitle="Usability Guru Jakob's site">Jakob Nielsen</a> and released this\nweek, 70% of those who had used WAP said that not only are WAP technologies,\nservices and content not currently usable, the same study subjects also\ndon't expect it to be usable at any point in the near future.</p><p>No real surprise to me - I can't think of <strong>any</strong> friends\nor colleagues who actually use their spiffy WAP phones. The only people\nbenefitting as far as I can see are Cellnet, mobile phone shops and WAP\ndevelopers.
