Despite all the hype about <cite>the mobile internet</cite> [sic],</p>people who actually have actually <strong>used</strong> WAP services</p>gave the current state of technology a resounding thumbs-down.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/wap/" title="View the summary.</p>You can download the full report for $18 ">a field study of WAP users</a></p>carried out in London by <a href="http://www.useit.com/"</p>title="Usability Guru Jakob's site">Jakob Nielsen</a> and released this</p>week, 70% of those who had used WAP said that not only are WAP technologies,</p>services and content not currently usable, the same study subjects also</p>don't expect it to be usable at any point in the near future.</p><p>No real surprise to me - I can't think of <strong>any</strong> friends</p>or colleagues who actually use their spiffy WAP phones. The only people</p>benefitting as far as I can see are Cellnet, mobile phone shops and WAP</p>developers.
