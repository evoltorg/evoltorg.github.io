Why? Many of the same reasons you do at work: Share a fast Internet connection - Share file space - Share databases - Work on projects together - and things we have not thought of yet. Now the question is how to build your own network and get all of these benefits. <P>\nSince we're on the subject of Intranets and, since there is a major push to get into the business of eCommerce, we will have a short discussion of the importance of our company's preparedness to take full advantage of e-Technologies, including its Intranet.   What allows or facilitates a company to be able to be a successful eBusiness?
