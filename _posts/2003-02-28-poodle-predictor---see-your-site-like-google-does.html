<p>One of the challenges a webmaster faces when designing a site, is getting it well-placed in the search-engines.</p>	Some might regard this as a job for a specialized Search Engine Optimiser, but mostly it just comes down to common-sense, and keeping a few basic rules in mind when designing the site.</p></p><p>	<p>One of the harder aspects though, is knowing how the search-engine will see your site.</p>	There are many sites stuck with an ugly Google listing, because they didn't realise search-engines don't use Javascript, or cookies, for instance.</p></p><p><p></p>	Just for fun, let's look at a few:</p></p><ul></p><li>	<a href="http://google.com/search?q=+%22not+support+javascript%22&as_qdr=m3" target="_blank">google.com/search?q=+%22not+support+javascript%22&as_qdr=m3</a></li></p><p><li>	<a href="http://google.com/search?q=+%22not+support+cookies%22&as_qdr=m3" target="_blank">google.com/search?q=+%22not+support+cookies%22&as_qdr=m3</a></li></p></ul></p><p>	<p>Those listings could have been avoided, but it would mean knowing something about what search-engines support, and what they don't, and the main problem is that you have to wait until your site is listed, before you can see the result.</p>	This usually takes about a month, and at least as long again before a bad listing is refreshed.</p></p><p>	<p>So we developed Poodle Predictor, a free tool to help web visualize what Google sees as it spiders your site, a search-engine simulator if you will.<p></p><p>	<p>The main application is found here at	<a href="http://www.gritechnologies.com/tools/spider.go?q=evolt.org" target="_blank">gritechnologies.com/tools/spider.go?q=evolt.org</a></p></p><p>	<p>This is the predictor-view, it's task is two-fold. Firstly to give you a rough idea of how your page's listing will look in Google, and secondly to find every link on the page that the search-engine would.</p></p><p>	<p>This list of links is ideally quite long, yet not more than 100 or so.</p></p><p>	<p>If you are using Flash or DHTML navigation you might find that none of the links show-up in Poodle's Predictor. In that case you should add the links inside <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tags, or as an alternative navigation system.</p></p><p>	<p>Underneath the main listing, you see three links, Diagnostics View - Source-code View - Header-Meta View.</p></p><p>	<p>The Diagnostics View opens the URL in Poodle Diagnostic. This gives you a color-coded view of the page through the 'eyes' of the search-engine spider.</p></p><p><p></p>	The colors reflect whether various important tags and attributes were used on the page. </p>	The text displayed should read logically - some alt and title attributes will show in your page, and this could give unexpected results, like &quot;welcome to [company_logo.gif]&quot;.</p></p><p>	<p>The Source-code View speaks for itself, it's a color-coded view of the source-code of the page. The color-coding again reflects the use of tags and attributes with importance for search-engines.</p></p><p>	<p>Finally the Header-Meta View will toggle the header and meta-tag section into view.</p></p>	<p>Other related pages are:</p></p><p><ul></p><li>	<a href="http://gritechnologies.com/tools/about_poodle.html" target="_blank">gritechnologies.com/tools/about_poodle.html</a></li></p><li>	<a href="http://gritechnologies.com/tools/rules_poodle.html" target="_blank">gritechnologies.com/tools/rules_poodle.html</a></li></p><li>	<a href="http://gritechnologies.com/tools/links_poodle.html" target="_blank">gritechnologies.com/tools/links_poodle.html</a></li></p></ul></p><p><p></p>	<p>I hope you enjoy using the tool, and feel free to comment here, or by email.</p></p><p><p>	Cheers, Richard.<br></p>	<a href="mailto:richard.b@gritechnologies.com">richard.b@gritechnologies.com</a>
