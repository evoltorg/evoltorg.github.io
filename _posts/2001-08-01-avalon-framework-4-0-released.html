<p> The Avalon project is Apache's Java Server Framework which is separated into six sub projects: Framework,\n  Excalibur, LogKit, Cornerstone, Phoenix, and Testlet.\n  Its purpose is to simplify server-side programming\n  for Java based projects and formalize several\n  best of breed practices and patterns for server side\n  programming.</p></p><p><p><h2>About Avalon Framework 4.0</h2></p>\n<p> The Avalon Framework formalizes the contracts and\n  patterns used in the other Avalon projects. It is\n  derived from modern software engineering techniques\n  and aims to provide a solid basis on which to build\n  server products.</p>\n<p>\nIn other words, the Avalon Framework provides:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Ready-to-use design patterns.</li>\n<li>A higher level of abstraction than OOP.</li>\n<li>Implementations of common components.</li>\n</ul>\n</p></p><p><p>\n<h2>ChangeLog for Avalon Framework 4.0</h2><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Added new method to Component Manager and Selector\nfor discovering if a Component exists inside or not.\nAlso augmented the default versions with the basic\nimplementation to discover them. [BL]</li></p><p><li>Added stylesheet to convert Stylebook markup to DocBook markup. [BL]</li></p><p><li>Changed the documentation build process to use Cocoon to build the site. [BL]</li></p><p><li>Added new "Developing with Avalon" book in DocBook format. [BL]</li></p><p><li>Added Executable interface to activity package. [PD]</li></p><p><li>Updated Resolvable interface to allow a ContextException to be thrown on failure. [PD]</li></p><p><li>Add a makeReadOnly() method to the default implementations\nof Configuration, Context and ComponentManager.\nCalling this method after the respective object\nhas been filled will make the object read-only. This\nis a safety precaution to stop code performing unwanted\noperations. [PD]</li></p><p><li>Updated the javadocs of many of the classes. [PD]</li></p><p><li>Update documentation so that it is more accurate and descriptive. [BL]</li>\n</ul>\n</p></p><p><p>Downloads for Avalon Framework 4.0 and more information about the Avalon project are available at\n<a \nhref="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon" target="_new" title="Opens in new window">the Avalon project website.</a>\n</p>
