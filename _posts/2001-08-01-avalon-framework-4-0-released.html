<p> The Avalon project is Apache's Java Server Framework which is separated into six sub projects: Framework,</p>  Excalibur, LogKit, Cornerstone, Phoenix, and Testlet.</p>  Its purpose is to simplify server-side programming</p>  for Java based projects and formalize several</p>  best of breed practices and patterns for server side</p>  programming.</p></p><p><p><h2>About Avalon Framework 4.0</h2></p></p><p> The Avalon Framework formalizes the contracts and</p>  patterns used in the other Avalon projects. It is</p>  derived from modern software engineering techniques</p>  and aims to provide a solid basis on which to build</p>  server products.</p></p><p></p>In other words, the Avalon Framework provides:<br></p><ul></p><li>Ready-to-use design patterns.</li></p><li>A higher level of abstraction than OOP.</li></p><li>Implementations of common components.</li></p></ul></p></p></p><p><p></p><h2>ChangeLog for Avalon Framework 4.0</h2><br></p><ul></p><li>Added new method to Component Manager and Selector</p>for discovering if a Component exists inside or not.</p>Also augmented the default versions with the basic</p>implementation to discover them. [BL]</li></p><p><li>Added stylesheet to convert Stylebook markup to DocBook markup. [BL]</li></p><p><li>Changed the documentation build process to use Cocoon to build the site. [BL]</li></p><p><li>Added new "Developing with Avalon" book in DocBook format. [BL]</li></p><p><li>Added Executable interface to activity package. [PD]</li></p><p><li>Updated Resolvable interface to allow a ContextException to be thrown on failure. [PD]</li></p><p><li>Add a makeReadOnly() method to the default implementations</p>of Configuration, Context and ComponentManager.</p>Calling this method after the respective object</p>has been filled will make the object read-only. This</p>is a safety precaution to stop code performing unwanted</p>operations. [PD]</li></p><p><li>Updated the javadocs of many of the classes. [PD]</li></p><p><li>Update documentation so that it is more accurate and descriptive. [BL]</li></p></ul></p></p></p><p><p>Downloads for Avalon Framework 4.0 and more information about the Avalon project are available at</p><a </p>href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon" target="_new" title="Opens in new window">the Avalon project website.</a></p></p>
