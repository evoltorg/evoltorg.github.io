<p>Hi there, you want me, I know you do. You got something to sell or you want to </p>be heard, or you want to share. In any case - you need me. To make matters worse,</p>you don't know anything about me.</p></p><p>I could be old, young, boy, girl, man, woman, </p>handicapped or fully abled. I can choose from a great variety of means to use</p>the internet and technology to control it, and you don't stand much chance to </p>know what I use.</p></p><p><h2>The things you do to get me</h2></p><p><p>You try hard to get me, no doubt about that. After all, your income or - in sadder</p>cases - your happiness, depends on it. And to ensure I hear you, you go far. Sometimes</p>you get pushy, and that puts me off. Let me count the ways you can annoy me:</p></p><p><h3>Don't throw things at me!</h3></p><p><p>One thing you seem to think makes a lot of sense is throwing things at me.</p> </p><p>Open new windows, cover my viewport in banners, make everything on the page</p>jump at me when I touch it with my mouse or tab to it with my keyboard. </p></p><p>You know what? This is annoying. I didn't ask for it, why do you think I want </p>it when you push harder? I counteract. To avoid wasting my time closing windows, </p>I use popup blockers. To get rid of things that are unrelated to what I was </p>looking for I use web filtering or browser extensions that turn off animation </p>and images of a certain size. Isn't the mere existence of these products hint </p>enough that I may not want to have things shoved in my face? If you need to use</p>a new window for something, make me aware of it. Tell me which links open in a </p>new window, and I know what will happen. </p></p><p><h3>Don't think I am mainly interested in the technology of your site</h3></p><p><p>We are all different. Things that make you go "ouhhhh" might make me go "ewwww" </p>or "zzzzzz".</p></p><p>It is not as common any longer, but there was a time where a web site without a</p>long and amazing flash tunnel was no web site. Thank god that this is over.</p> </p><p>Still, there are things you use that are amusing or interesting for the first time, </p>but really bug me when I come back (if you are lucky and I do come back). Don't make me </p>wait for you, don't fade the page or the navigation in and out endlessly. I might</p>not have your fancy and fast computer, which means I wait a lot longer than you,</p>and I don't like waiting, not at all. Time is money. Yes, there are flat rates and</p>I don't pay by the minute any longer, but I still consider my time precious. </p>I am not likely to be impressed by the same thing over and over again. You can </p>impress me for the first time, but please, give me a chance to get rid of that </p>same thing when I come back. Put it somewhere, in a sitemap for </p>example, so, if I'd be inclined to see it again, I can have another look at it.</p>Also, I might not see your fancy thing at all! I might be security aware or </p>paranoid, or my company is, and have all plug-ins and scripting and whatnot turned</p>off. If you still want me, give me another way to reach you.</p></p><p><h3>Don't patronize me</h3></p><p><p>I appreciate that you want the best for me. That is nice. But please don't </p>think that what is best for you, is also best for me. I know what is best for me,</p>I installed my computer or bought my mobile or my TV set top box, and, if possible,</p>chose my browser and the plug-ins I want to have. The plug-ins I might have gotten, </p>because I wanted to reach some content, that was nicely offered to me. Don't</p>think that making your web site look and behave like your operating system gives</p>me the same homely feeling it gives you. I willingly came to see your site, I </p>don't want to change my browser or operating system. Don't block me out, because</p>I am not like you. You like your design; you think it is the best. I might disagree</p>and use my own user style sheet to overwrite all that is out there. Can you still </p>offer me your product or your content? If so, good for us, if not, bad for you.</p></p><p><h3>Don't redecorate my house</h3></p><p><p>I like my browser / surfing device. I chose it, or I got it chosen for me, or </p>I don't have a chance to change it. Don't take it away from me, or I'll be </p>miffed. I like to use the back button, when I think the page I surfed to is </p>not what I wanted. I don't need your page in full screen, if I want that, I can</p>do that myself. Don't take away my toolbars or my ability to right-click or </p>shift click an element. You can't win. </p></p><ul></p></li>You open your site in an x by y window - I copy and paste the url from the </p>properties into my own window</li></p><li>You turn off my back button - I use a keyboard shortcut to go back to the previous document.</li></p><li>You change my browser history to always go back to your page - I disable Javascript</li></p><li>You use a "no right click" script - I disable Javascript</li> </p></ul></p><p>There is no need for us to fight an uneven battle like this. If you give an </p>important document to someone, you don't re-arrange their desk </p>first, do you? Why do you think I want you to change my browser? I like it </p>the way it is, with all my shortcuts, toolbars, sidebars and tabs.</p></p><p><h3>Don't replicate what I already have - and badly at that</h3></p><p><p>I use a browser, and that fabulous thing comes with everything I need: The </p>ability to move around a document via tabbing, scrolling with my mouse wheel or </p>my trackball or via the scrollbars, the ability to enter text and send it off to</p>your server.</p> </p><p>I like these controls - a lot! I got used to them, which might have</p>been a long and painful process, so please don't confuse me by changing them to</p>fit your design.</p> </p><p>I don't need a DHTML scroller that I cannot use with a keyboard, </p>or that shows no indicator how big the document is. I don't want to search for</p>form fields and buttons and scrollbars - chances are that you are not able to </p>style them properly for my browser anyway.</p> </p><p>These are vital elements of my surfing</p>experience, I don't want to think about them, they trigger automated processes in my brain. If you make </p>me look for them, you take my attention away from your content, and that is what</p>you don't want, right?</p> </p><p>If I want to print out your page, I do so by pressing the cute printer icon of </p>my browser, or I use my keyboard shortcut, I don't need a link, image or button</p>sending me to that one, a gadget that only works with javascript anyway. If you </p>add a "print this" feature, then please give me a proper print version of the </p>document, with stripped backgrounds, no unnecessary navigation and the inline links </p>as a list of URLs underneath so I can look them up next time I go online.</p> </p><p>If I want to bookmark your site, I can do that, no need for you to give me an </p>extra javascript link for that, thanks.</p></p><p>Popups I close almost immediately -  no need to add a javascript close button.</p> </p><p>And if there is a need for a back button, then your concept of navigation failed,</p>and I am not likely to use it anyways, as my browser comes with a cool back button </p>and keyboard shortcut to go back to the previous document.</p></p><p><h2>So, how can you get me?</h2></p><p><p>There are some things, that have been and are done successfully throughout the </p>years of the internet. The biggest one is the big C - content.</p></p><p><h3>Provide me with the content I want</h3></p><p><p>A web site with the right content can look horrid and be a tad harder</p>to use -  I don't care, as I found what I was looking for. The easier to get to</p>the content, the better.</p> </p><p>Write plain text and cut it  into easily digestible </p>chunks rather than 2 pages of corporate mumbo jumbo before I find the one </p>thing I want.</p> </p><p>If it is a download I want, make the download links with version </p>numbers and sizes available from the very beginning, I promise to read on while</p>I download!</p></p><p><h3>Provide me with a clean and fast navigation - give me a sitemap to access everything</h3></p>  </p><p>Your navigation is what takes me by the hand and leads me through your web site.</p></p><p>Don't make me search for it, don't smother me in links I really don't need at </p>the moment, just make it easy for me to see where I am in your site, and what </p>else is in this section. Keep the navigation on the same spot and looking </p>roughly the same and I feel secure and guided without being pushed. </p>Use the right wording in your navigation, keep it short and simple, I don't need</p>poetry and metaphors in navigation items.</p></p><p>There is normally no need to allow me to go to every page in the site within </p>the main navigation - this'll only mean I need to navigate through a lot of links </p>to find what I want - keep this to the sitemap.</p> </p><p><h3>Let me search</h3></p><p>I love searching, and a good search feature is perfect if I don't have the time</p>to navigate through your site - this time. Give me a search function that is </p>easy to use and prominently available on each page and I promise to use it and</p>stay a bit.</p></p><p><h3>Make me feel comfortable </h3></p><p><p>Use nice, clean language to help me overcome my original shyness and reluctance to stay long. Use good harmonious </p>colour schemes and imagery to give me a good feeling about your site -  don't forget</p>to add alternative content for those, should I not be able to see.</p></p><p>Make sure to </p>keep a nice and consistent look throughout the site.</p></p><p>When there are processes that </p>need more than one step, provide me with an indicator how far I am in the process</p>and allow me to go back any time. </p></p><p><h3>Invite me to participate</h3></p><p>Give me options to tweak your content to my desires, allow me to get rid of </p>parts and add others that I am interested in. Tell me what I have looked at before</p>and alert me when there was an update in that section. Offer me related articles</p>or products and greet me when I come back to your page next time. Nothing is better</p>for you and me than me coming back and be reminded of a good experience. </p></p><p><h3>Stay fresh</h3></p><p>The home page should not be a static "hello to yaddayaddayadda" page, it has to</p>be a living and changing element of the site that tells me about changes and </p>highlights special features and new content. Only that way I can find the </p>goodies immediately.</p> </p><p><h2>Don't cry, I didn't take your toys away</h2></p><p>I am aware that your web presence is your baby, and you are proud of it, and </p>you want to make it interesting for you and for me. That is how you ended up </p>using cool technological tricks and web design ideas that are the talk of town at </p>the moment in the first place.</p> </p><p>I don't want you to create boring text sites, you </p>can add cool stuff, just make sure to do so in moderation.</p></p><p>Make sure that </p>only those who can access the cool enhancements get them, and that they  fall back to </p>a usable HTML construct for everybody. I like nice designs as much as you do, </p>but I still want headlines in my document. I love navigations that have smooth</p>rollovers and effects, but I might need those as lists of links at the same time. </p>Degrade gracefully, as they call it, it is harder to do, but fun to find out how </p>to do it.</p> </p><p><p>Trust me, for I am user, and you want me.</p>
