<p>The <a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/" target="_blank">Netscape DevEdge</a> website has been redesigned and unveiled with valid code.  The new design boasts XHTML 1.0 Transitional and CSS, along with many goodies.  The site was released as of February 11, 2003.  The DevEdge team is quite proud of their new work and well deserved.  Much work obviously went into this project. </p></p><p><p>They did a nice job of implementing some other features as well.  The navigational menu, structured with lists, uses JavaScript and CSS for power.  It, of course, works in multiple browsers and remains available to those who are out of date.  There is also user-selctable style sheets and font-size that are available with a quick switch in the right hand navigation panel.  This, obviously, allows users to adapt the site to their liking.  </p></p><p><p>The designers also took advantage of using stylesheets to control 'printer-friendly' pages.

They help support the perks of using such valid, structured code.  All in all, I think the DevEdge team has done a great job in moving foward.  Their site shows how it's done.</p>
