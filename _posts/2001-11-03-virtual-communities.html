<p>\n	I recently started a project based on <strong>'Virtual Communities' \n	</strong>. As I was conducting research and benchmarking, \n	my challenge stuck me - \n</p>\n<p>\n	&quot;How do I build a virtual community based around a specific \n	geographic area?&quot;\n</p>\n	<p>\n	It is easy to see how communities based on a topical interest are\n	formed. With a <strong>deep interest and passion</strong> for a \n	topic of choice, such as politics or hobbies, people quickly \n	find a 'common interest' and begin to share.\n</p>\n	<p>\n	Geographic based communities are of a <strong>different nature</strong>.\n	People are less reliant on local community than previous \n	generations - most government and important services are available \n	regardless of your locality.\n</p>\n	<p>\n	I don't have the strategy yet, but I am sure that online community \n	services that improve quality of life are <em>key</em>. I'll share \n	the results of the project in Feb. 2002. In the meantime. here is \n	a <strong>collection of useful virtual community resources;\n</strong></p>\n	<h2>Community Features</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n		<a href="http://www.onlinecommunityreport.com/features/10/">Top Ten Trends \n		forï¿½ Online Communities</a>, July. 2001 \n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.08/hagel.html">\n		It Takes a Village to Make a Mall</a>, Wired Aug. 1997 \n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="http://www.clickz.com/ebiz/onl_biz_models/article.php/811191" target="_blank">\n		Community Chest</a>, ClickZ May 28, 1999 \n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="http://www.clickz.com/b2b_mkt/b2b_strat/article.php/819181" target="_blank">\n		Business Communities</a>, ClickZ Dec. 17, 1999 \n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/kollock/papers/economies.htm" target="_blank">\n		The Economies of Online Cooperation</a>, 1999 \n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/kollock/papers/design.htm" target="_blank">\n		Design Principles for Online Communities,</a> June 1998 \n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="http://www.naima.com/CS377B/class.html" target="_blank">\n		Designing Online Communities</a>, NAIMA \n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="http://www.cio.com/archive/enterprise/101599_virtent.html" target="_blank">\n		It Takes an E-Village</a>, CIO Oct. 15, 1999 \n	</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n	My Communities\n</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <a href="http://www.expatica.com/" target="_blank">Expatica</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <a href="http://evolt.org/" target="_blank">Evolt</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <a href="http://www.broadcast.net/blists.html" target="_blank">\n	Broadcast.net\n    </li>\n   </ul>\n</p>\n<h2>\n	Other links\n</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    <a href="http://webcrossing.com/">Web Crossing</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <a href="http://www.thewell.com/" target="_blank">The Well</a>\n    </li>\n<ul>\nIf you want any further info, please visit <a href="http://www.mikeparsons.net" target="_blank">\n	mikeparsons.net\n</ul>
