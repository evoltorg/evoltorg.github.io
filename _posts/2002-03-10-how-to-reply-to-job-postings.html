excerpt: "Having troubles replying to job postings.</p>Following these basic guidelines can help you get your email taken seriously."
---
<p>It can be very difficult to know exactly how to reply to a job posting. What to say, how to introduce </p>yourself, and what to avoid. These are all major factors.</p></p><p>I used to have trouble finding qualified people to take my contracts. Not because they weren't out there, </p>but because I didn't know what to look for. I used to excuse things like poor English and misspelled words. </p>Not anymore! Spell check is a built in feature on almost every email client out there. If you don't know how </p>to use it, why would anyone think you could do the work?</p></p><p><h2>Check your Spelling</h2></p><p><p>The first thing is ALWAYS check your spelling!</p></p><p>Spell check sometimes isn't enough either. Re-read your email slowly and carefully. Check for words spelled </p>differently. If you spell "right" instead of "write" your spell checker isn't going to catch it. But the person </p>reading it for the first time is.</p></p><p><h2>Check Your Grammar</h2></p><p><p>Secondly, check your grammar. You don't want to sound like you're a hick from the back hills that is uneducated. </p>Here is an example: "I am to provide references and web sites for your review." What exactly does this mean? </p>Is this supposed to be a question? If you make it a habit to re-read your emails before sending them you </p>will be amazed at the number of mistakes you will find.</p></p><p><h2>Formatting</h2></p><p><p>Another very important point is to make sure your email is not formatted. Never send HTML formatted emails </p>when replying to a project posting. There are many people that hate formatted emails and it may cost you the </p>contract. Before sending your reply, check your setting and be sure it is set to "plain text".</p></p><p><h2>Be Concise</h2></p><p><p>Now that we know how important it is to check your formatting, grammar and spelling, let's move on to what </p>you should say. It is very important to let the project poster know what you can do. This doesn't mean sending </p>your resume. Be brief and to the point. Here is an example:</p></p><p><p>My name is Brad Miller and I have been designing web sites for 5 years. You can view some of the sites I have</p>designed by clicking the links below.</p></p><p></p>www.somesite.com<br></p>www.anothersite.com<br></p>www.thelastsite.com<br></p></p></p><p></p>If you can provide me with a little more information about the project I would be happy to provide you a quote</p>for the project.</p></p></p><p><p>At this point you may want to list a few questions you have about the project.</p></p><p><p>Depending on what type of job you are trying to get you may want to go into a little more detail. Please </p>remember that most of the time you will be responding to someone who knows all about the job and the credentials </p>needed. So if it is a web design job, they really won't care if you have made brochures for some company. </p>All they care about is, can you do the web design stuff.</p></p><p><p>If you have other skills and would like to let them know, do it in the second or third email. After </p>they feel comfortable with you they may want to know that you can also make brochures for them.</p></p><p><h2>Asking Questions</h2></p><p><p>So you've introduced yourself and are ready to get down to business. It is now time to ask questions. </p>Asking the right questions can make or break you. Be knowledgeable about the subject and ask simple yet </p>vital questions.</p></p><p><p>There is always one question that needs to be asked; what is the deadline?</p></p><p><p>Beyond that the questions asked need to be pertinent to the project. Stay focused and figure out what </p>you need to know to give an accurate quote. Generally, a project posting does not contain much information </p>about the project other than what type of programs or languages are needed. If this is the case, ask for a </p>complete description of what needs to be accomplished. Find out what the resulting goals are of the project.</p></p><p><h2>Goals</h2></p><p><p>Let's talk about goals for a minute. The goals of the client are very important. They have a vision and you </p>possess the skills to make that vision possible. A project is an idea, and you need to take that idea and turn </p>it into reality. You're the solution to their problems. Be a solution, not an added problem.</p></p><p><p>Let's recap, check your spelling, check your grammar, check your formatting, introduce yourself but be </p>brief, and ask the right questions. What are we missing?</p></p><p><h2>Contact Information</h2></p><p><p>Make sure you include a signature at the bottom of every email. Use </p>your full name and include any web addresses that you personally own or maintain. And don't forget to put </p>your phone number in there too. It is very important that they know how to contact you. I am more willing </p>to give a job to someone that gives me a phone number and a physical address than someone that just tells </p>me their name and expects me to grab their email address out of the "from" box.</p></p><p><p>Remember you are selling yourself not your skills. If I get a warm fuzzy feeling from your email I will </p>most likely award you the job.</p></p><p><h2>Communication</h2></p><p><p>Let's not stop there. We need to talk about communication. Communication is more important than anything </p>else. When I have a project and I need to contract out some of the work I want an immediate response. </p>I don't have the time to sit and discuss a project with 20 different people, so I am going to discuss </p>it with the first 5 qualified people that respond. This, of course, is only valid for job postings that are email based</p>postings from job lists and email lists. This would not apply for sites like Monster.com.</p></p><p><p>Communication doesn't stop there. You have to be on the ball throughout the duration of the project. </p>Granted you can't check your email every five minutes of every day. You have to get some work done some </p>time. But you should at the very least check it 5 times a day. Checking your mail doesn't constitute good </p>communication you actually have to respond to them too.</p></p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p><p>Just following the items above will not guarantee you the contract. You will still need to display </p>confidence and understanding. Showing confidence in your sentences let people know that you are willing </p>to do what it takes to get the job done. Understanding the project and the situation will show you are </p>knowledgeable and care enough to take the time to help.</p></p><p><p>Here is a checklist that you can use when replying to job postings.<br></p><input type="checkbox"> - Check your spelling.<br></p><input type="checkbox"> - Check your grammar - re-read every email twice.<br></p><input type="checkbox"> - Send plain text emails.<br></p><input type="checkbox"> - Keep your replies concise and to the point.<br></p><input type="checkbox"> - Ask knowledgeable questions.<br></p><input type="checkbox"> - Good communication means replying to emails as soon as possible.
