<h2>IA Cocktail Hour in Santiago de Chile</h2></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.evolt.org/user/mantruc/138/index.html" title="Mantruc's evolt.org user page">mantruc</a></strong>, our evolter from South America, hosted the first meeting of web workers with experience in Information Architecture in his city.</p></p><p>The event gathered 11 people in its first incarnation. It was a very enthusiastic conversation and they all hope to gather more people for next month.</p></p><p>IA Cocktail Hours take place every first Thursday of each month in several cities around the globe. This first step added Santiago to that list, helped in coordination by the people of Spain, who started their meetings a couple of months ago.</p></p><h3>Spanish Invitation ahead:</h3></p><p><span lang="es">Si hay alg&uacute;n Chileno leyendo esto y quiere unirse, visita <a href="http://mantruc.com/chela.html" target="_blank">esta</a> pagina.</span></p></p><p><h2>Site Launches</h2></p><ul></p><li><p>After working on it since last summer, <a href="/user/MartinB/32/index.html"><strong>MartinB</strong></a>'s pretty relieved that the new <a href="http://www.guinness.com/" target="_new" title="Opens in a new window">guinness.com</a> site has gone live.
