<p>XFML is an XML language to share hierarchical faceted metadata. The spec for </p>  <strong>XFML Core</strong> (aka XFML version 1.0) is here: <a href="http://www.xfml.org/spec/1.0.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">http://www.xfml.org/spec/1.0.html</a> </p>  It also describes <a href="http://www.xfml.org/spec/1.0.html#valueofxfml" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">why </p>  XFML is different</a>. The spec contains <a href="http://www.xfml.org/spec/1.0.html#conceptualmodel" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">a </p>  conceptual model</a>, a <a href="http://www.xfml.org/spec/1.0.html#xfmlformatspecification" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">description </p>  of the XML specification</a> and <a href="http://www.xfml.org/spec/1.0.html#processinginstructions" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" >processing </p>  instructions</a>.</p></p><p>Even for experienced metadata practitioners, some of the concepts in XFML can </p>  be a bit weird. An XFML map consists of a number of <strong>facets</strong> (containers), </p>  that each have trees of <strong>topics</strong> in them. It also contains a list of <strong>pages</strong> </p>  with <strong>occurrences</strong> of topics on those pages.</p></p><p>Before we start, note that XFML doesn't try to syndicate all your metadata. </p>  Only the metadata that is expressible as categories in facets. It doesn't try </p>  to replace <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">RDF</a> or <a href="http://topicmaps.org" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">XTM</a> </p>  (Topicmaps) or other metadata formats: XFML is a very specific, focused format, </p>  much like RSS.</p></p><h2>Topics</h2></p><p>In XFML, metadata consists of topics. Topics are categories, and are organized </p>  in hierarchies (trees). Anything you can think of can be a topic. &quot;Norway&quot; </p>  could be a topic. Or &quot;Betrayal&quot;. Or &quot;That dog that is barking </p>  outside my window right now&quot;. Which topics to choose only depends on your </p>  website: how do you want to present or organize the information in it. (<a href="http://www.xfml.org/spec/1.0.html#topicconcept" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Topic </p>  concept explained in the spec</a>)</p></p><pre>&lt;topic id=&quot;bogota&quot; facetid=&quot;place_to_go&quot; parentTopicid=&quot;colombia&quot;&gt;</p>  &lt;name&gt;Bogota&lt;/name&gt;</p>  &lt;/topic&gt;</pre></p><h2>Facets.</h2></p><p>Facets are containers that contain hierarchies of topics. The special thing </p>  about facets is that they are mutually exclusive containers: &quot;Places&quot;, </p>  &quot;Things to do&quot; and &quot;People&quot; are mutually exclusive because </p>  something cannot be a place and a thing to do at the same time. So they make </p>  good facets.</p></p><p>Why organize topic trees in facets? Because it makes categorizing, browsing </p>  and searching a lot easier by combining facets. There is a long history of library </p>  science research behind this, <a href="http://www.kmconnection.com/DOC100100.htm" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">here</a> is a good overview. Just remember: </p>  organizing topic trees in facets makes life easier. There are several good interfaces </p>  available that let you try out browsing a faceted classification: <a href="http://facetmap.com" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Facetmap</a> </p>  and Teapot Server (by <a href="http://bpallen.com" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">bpallen technologies</a>) </p>  are two good examples that are also XFML compatible. (<a href="http://www.xfml.org/spec/1.0.html#facetconcept" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Facet </p>  concept explained in the spec</a>)</p></p><code>&lt;facet id=&quot;thing_to_do&quot;&gt;things to do&lt;/facet&gt;</code></p><h2>Pages.</h2></p><p>Adding pages to an XFML document means you are sharing your indexing efforts. </p>  Indexing means assigning topics to pages (or the other way round). Quality indexing </p>  takes a lot of work, and XFML makes it possible to share your indexing so other </p>  people can reuse it.</p></p><pre>&lt;page url=&quot;http://poorbuthappy.com/colombia&quot;&gt;</p>  &lt;title&gt;Guide to Colombia&lt;/title&gt;</p>  &lt;description&gt;A website about Colombia&lt;/description&gt;</p>  &lt;occurrence topicid=&quot;diving&quot;/&gt;</p>  &lt;occurrence topicid=&quot;bogota&quot; strength=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;</p>  &lt;/page&gt;</pre></p><p>Since in XFML pages are indexed with topics in the same map, if you want to </p>  reuse other people's indexing, you need to know what their topics mean in your </p>  map. (Read this sentence twice) </p></p><p>You need to indicate to your application: &quot;My topic A equals this other </p>  maps' topic X&quot;. You can publish these connections with the connect element. </p>  An alternative way of indicating what a topic means is to use a Published Subject </p>  Indicator or psi. IF you are familiar with Topicmaps you will know what these </p>  are: a psi is a url that points to a webpage that explains what the topic is. </p>  So the topic &quot;White house&quot; could have a psi pointing to http://www.whitehouse.gov </p>  Psi's are useful for automatic discovery of equal topics. The idea is that, </p>  if two topics in different maps have the same psi, an application will know </p>  for sure they are the same.</p></p><pre>&lt;topic id=&quot;colombia&quot; facetid=&quot;place_to_go&quot;&gt;</p>  &lt;name&gt;Colombia&lt;/name&gt;</p>  &lt;connect&gt;http://othersite.com/xfml.xml#18753&lt;/connect&gt;</p>  &lt;psi&gt;http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/co.html&lt;/psi&gt;</p>  &lt;psi&gt;http://poorbuthappy.com/colombia&lt;/psi&gt;</p>  &lt;description&gt;Colombia, the country&lt;/description&gt;</p>  &lt;/topic&gt;</pre></p><h2>Publishing maps.</h2></p><p>You can simply put your map on your website as an XML document (http://www.yourdomain.com/maps/xfml.xml), </p>  in the same way you would publish an RSS feed for example. Once published, other </p>  people can take your map and generate links to your website, or maybe reuse </p>  parts of the organization scheme you created.</p></p><h2>Conclusion.</h2></p><p>So in short: XFML lets you share metadata. That's important because creating </p>  metadata vocabularies is really hard, and indexing lots of pages is even harder. </p>  Sharing these efforts is made possible by using &lt;connect&gt; and &lt;psi&gt;. </p>  XFML Core is a frozen standard: you can safely implement it - it won't change. </p>  Work on XFML 2.0 has started, but that is a long way off, and it will be a language </p>  with a different purpose than XFML Core. Tool support is taking off: <a href="http://xfml.org/software.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">overview </p>  of XFML compatible tools</a>.<br></p></p>
