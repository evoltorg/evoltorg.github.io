In years past Marlene served as evolt.org's executive director and treasurer, though she's not much involved these days. But she still encourages visitors to <a href=\"http://www.evolt.org/article/Help_support_evolt_org/9741/29298/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">give to evolt.org</a>.</p>

She's subsequently been involved in print design, illustration, and since 1995, professional web design and development. Her other skills are information architecture, usability testing and site management (the largest at 14,000+ pages).

An interpretation of an obscure rule buried in the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 may lead to strict requirements for making Federal web sites handicapped accessible, and has the potential to filter down to privately run web sites. Check out </p><a href="http://www.freedomforum.org/templates/document.asp?documentID=11525" target="_new">this article.</a> </p><p>"One preview of what the barrier board may publish next month," according to Freedom Forum, "is contained in its own notices, which state that, in addition to conventional html and pdf versions available online, all online information must also be available from the agency via audio text and TTY, as well as 'cassette tape, Braille, large print, or computer disk.'"
