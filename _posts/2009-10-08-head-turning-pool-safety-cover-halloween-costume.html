Example, using old materials like worn-out <a href=http://www.cheappoolproducts.com/Winter~Covers_270~supplies.html>pool safety cover</a>.\n<br><br>\nCostumes like witch, ghost, angel or devil are popular among girls. And sadly, it won't help you to stand out. Using the aforementioned pool cover above or any scrap materials, you can create different types of costume.\n<br><br>\nIf you are interested to have this kind of costume, here are the steps on how to create a dress costume using pool covers:\n<br><br>\nStep 1: Think of a dress you'd like to wear. Dreaming to achieve a <a href=http://www.nydailynews.com/lifestyle/fashion/2009/04/06/2009-04-06_you_in_there_nicole_kidman_star_goes_mor.html>Morticia Addams dress</a>? search for serpentina dress pattern. You can search different easy-to-follow dress patterns over the internet. Be safe on choosing a  material. Your chosen “fabric” must be convenient to apply in your pattern.\n<br><br>\nStep 2: You must have a basic knowledge in sewing and/or pattern-making. Or ask for some help in sewing.\n<br><br>\nStep 3: Draw the design that you feel. Your drawing must be accurate so you can compare your sketch from the actual work. In some cases, the dress is more beautiful than the sketch, and vice versa. We'd prefer the former case, right?\n<br><br>\nStep 4: Ready your chosen material, let's say a pool safety cover. Measure the essential body parts required in your pattern. If your preferred pattern requires your buttocks' measurement, do so. Spare some allowance on your measured design. When you're done, you can start cutting the material following the pattern of your design.\n<br><br>\nStep 5: Start sewing the cut-outs. Allowances on the pattern will help you wear the dress comfortably. Some dress patterns that don't require sewing because of draping technique. The advantage of draping is that no sewing required. The disadvantage, you just have be very playful and creative. Draping is not suitable for the pool safety cover. Hence, sewing will do the magic.\n<br><br>\nStep 6: Let's say your pool safety cover costume is <a href=http://www.costumzee.com/tag/nymph/>inspired from a forest  nymph</a>, you may add some details like gems, dried leaves, twigs, and stones. \n<br><br>\nHalloween isn't all about scary costumes. Being creative for you costume will make you stand out. Go and create a Halloween costume, without spending too much.
