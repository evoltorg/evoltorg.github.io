<p>In a post on the <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/">Google Webmaster Central</a> blog today (<a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html">Google does not use the keywords meta tag in web ranking</a>), Google has clarified its policy on meta tags and page rank. Those of us trying to protect our clients from SEO/SEM snake-oil salesmen are happy to finally have an official statement from Google. In short, here it is:</p><ul><li>Google does not use meta keywords in its web search ranking and "has ignored the keywords meta tag for years."</li><li>Google sometimes uses the description meta tag as the abstract for search results, but not for web search ranking.</li></ul><p>There are many other variants of the meta tag, including some unique to Google. See the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=79812">Google Webmaster help page discussing meta tags</a> for a list of values Google supports (pay attention to the robots meta tag).
