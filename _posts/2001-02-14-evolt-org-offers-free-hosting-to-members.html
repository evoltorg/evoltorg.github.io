excerpt: "Ever wanted to try your hand at ColdFusion, but couldn't afford it? Wanted to dip into PHP but just couldn't get it to install? How about moving from MS Access to MySQL, but didn't have your own server? Evolt.org is now offering free hosting to its members for development and personal u..."

<p></p>Evolt.org is happy to announce free hosting in a ColdFusion, PHP, and MySQL environment for its members. <a href="http://members.evolt.org" target="_new">http://members.evolt.org</a></p><p></p>We understand that it's not always easy to learn new technologies in the web development industry especially if those technologies aren't readily available to you. For those HTML monkeys that would like to dig a bit deeper and learn some PHP, this is the place. For ASP folks who are interested in picking up some ColdFusion skills, you can do it here. Get your feet wet with MySQL. The situations go on and on. Taking down the roadblocks to development by allowing for easy entry into otherwise unattainable fields of knowledge, we're making the web a better place for developers and keeping in line with the evolt.org philosophy of a world wide web for the developer by the developer.</p></p></p><p></p>We're doing this by setting up a server class machine with several application server technologies (PHP and ColdFusion for now, more to come) and a MySQL database for you to learn and play on. FTP access, 15Mb space, a members.evolt.org mailbox, datasources, and SSH access (coming soon) are also available without the need for banner or pop up ads on your web site. This server space could be used to dabble in new technologies as mentioned above, but it's also a place for our members to put up personal sites, weblogs, online diaries, or their portfolios. Of course it's up to the member what they want to do with the space, all we ask is that you don't use if for commercial or illegal purposes and are first an evolt member. Read the <a href="http://members.evolt.org/tos.cfm" target="_new">terms</a> for more info. </p></p></p><p></p>More information is available on the <a href="http://members.evolt.org" target="_new">members.evolt.org web site</a>. If anyone else has ideas of cool projects we could do, feel free to post them below. Have fun!</p></p>
