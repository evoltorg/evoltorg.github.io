ColdFusion 5.0 has been released by Macromedia. Some of the new features include:</p><OL></p><LI>User defined functions</p><LI>Charting (simple, but nice)</p><LI>CFDUMP, the coder's best friend. This used to be in Spectra only, but now it's in the server proper. Not one day goes by where I don't use this tag.</p><LI>Query of Queries</p><LI>Flushed output</p><LI>Server reporting enhancements</p><LI>Server archiving. This is a <I>really</I> cool feature where you can backup both code and server settings into a simple file that can be deployed to new machines. This makes working in a cluster much easier.</p><LI>Server probes. A cool way to check the health of your system and perform actions when things go to heck.</p></OL></p><p>There is a lot more, so I suggest you check <A HREF="http://www.allaire.com" TARGET="new">Allaire.com</A> for more information.</p><p>In general, this is a cool release both on the code side, as well as the management side. In fact, I think it's a much bigger release for how it aids and supports the management of web apps.
