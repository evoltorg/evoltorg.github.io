<p></p>    Wapsight <a href="http://wapsight.com/info/2000/04/25/220904.html" target="_new">reported</a> yesterday </p>    that Phone.com have taken a stand against Geoworks' U.S. Patent No. 5,327,529, which they </p>    claim covers WAP technology. Phone.com are claiming that:</p></p></p><p></p>    <cite>&quot;(their) technology does not infringe the Geoworks patent, and that that </p>    patent is also invalid and unenforceable.&quot;</cite></p></p></p><p></p>    As the author of an <a href="http://wapwarp.com/geoworks" target="_new">open letter</a> to Don </p>    Ezzell, Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel for Geoworks, I for one am </p>    extremely interested in the outcome of this case. My original concerns rested mostly </p>    on the subject of Geoworks' heavy handed licensing scheme, where companies developing </p>    anything utilising WAP technology would have to pay a steep licensing cost. In </p>    my opinion it's about time someone took a stand against this patent claim. I would </p>    be very interested to know whether any companies have *actually* paid up the 20,000 </p>    USD licensing fee. I certainly hope that nobody has. Donald Ezzell, Geoworks' </p>    chief technology officer in his reply to my letter stated that</p></p></p><p></p><cite></p>    &quot;Already, many small companies have contacted us, provided the information </p>    about their company and WAP enabled or related goods or services, and applied for </p>    the license.&quot;</cite></p></p></p><p></p>    - however I believe that here he was discussing the companies who would pay a highly </p>    reduced licensing fee for having revenue below 1,000,000 USD a year. I somehow suspect </p>    that the sort of company who would earn sufficient money to pay up a 20,000 USD </p>    license would also be the sort of company who would be extremely suspicious of </p>    Geoworks' claims. I therefore guess that they have had few, if any, full licensees.</p></p></p><p></p>    (Any information on this would be extremely interesting).</p></p></p><p></p>    This is the line I like in the press release -</p></p></p><p></p>    <cite>&quot;In its complaint, Phone.com asserts that Phone.com's technology does </p>    not infringe the Geoworks '529 patent, and that the patent is also invalid and </p>    unenforceable.&quot;</cite></p></p></p><p></p>    Those second and third parts, about the patent being invalid and unenforceable are </p>    the areas to watch I guess. As a non-lawyer, my interpretation is that the first </p>    part is to defend their own technology, but the others say that Geoworks' entire claim </p>    is bogus, as their patent is too broad and does not in effect define WAP.</p></p></p><p></p>    Here's the part of Phone.com's filing that the case (in my opinion) seems to hang on -</p></p></p><blockquote></p>    &quot;Despite Geoworks' assertion that the '529 is essential to WAP-compliant devices </p>    and services, the '529 patent simply does not cover (and does not even mention) </p>    the wireless Internet technology. Instead, the '529 patent is solely directed </p>    to certain object-oriented programming techniques, none of which cover WAP, WML, </p>    wireless applications or the Internet. Indeed, making clear that the '529 patent </p>    is directed to object-oriented programming, and not to WAP or markup languages </p>    (which existed and were well-known when the '529 patent was applied for), the </p>    '529 patent specification reads as a &quot;primer&quot; on object-oriented </p>    programming, and never mentions markup languages, the Internet or wireless </p>    communications. The only embodiment disclosed is also an object-oriented </p>    programmed operating system. Nothing in the patent, the file history and </p>    the cited prior art acknowledges, discusses, suggests or contemplates the </p>    use of markup languages for any purpose, much less for use with the Internet. </p>    In short, the '529 patent does not cover WAP-compliant devices and services </p>    that employ WML. Phone.com's technology clearly does not infringe any claim of </p>    the '529 patent.&quot;</p></blockquote></p><p></p>    This is what we have been arguing all along and what the court should in all </p>    likelihood not take too long to realise.</p></p></p><p></p>    What is also extremely interesting in Phone.com's filing is their claim that </p>    prior art information pertinent to the patent was &quot;intentionally withheld&quot; </p>    from the United States Patent and Trademark Office with intention to decieve. </p>    I will be extremely interested to hear the outcome of this part of the case.</p></p></p><p></p>    It's a shame the case is taking part in San Francisco, as I would love to </p>    be able to watch the proceedings. Anyway, I guess we will get updates from </p>    our news sources such as <a href="http://wapsight.com" target="_new">Wapsight</a> and I </p>    will try to keep evolt.org updated on any developments.</p></p></p><p></p>    Watch this space...</p></p>
