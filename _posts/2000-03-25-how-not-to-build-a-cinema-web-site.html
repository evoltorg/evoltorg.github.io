<p>You go to the cinema to see a film. You go to the cinema's Web site to find out what's on, </p><p>and when (and maybe in the future, even see the movie itself), and you want to find this </p><p>information as quickly as possible. The <a href="http://www.hoyts.com.au/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Hoyts Cinemas</a> </p><p>Web site can tell you what's on in your area, but it's a chore to find out. Personally, I </p><p>think that considering the current state of the Web, it's inexcusable to have such a poorly </p><p>structured cinema Web site.</p></p><p><p>The core of a cinema site are the session times - there is no doubt about this. During a </p><p>development process, this should be identified immediately, and the entire site should be </p><p>designed around this feature.</p></p><p><p>Let's step through using the Hoyts site, and see what we have to do to find out what's </p><p>showing and where:</p></p><p><ol></p><p><li><p>Enter the URL: <a </p><p>href="http://www.hoyts.com.au/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">http://www.hoyts.com.au/</a>.</p></li></p><p><li><p>Click "What's On".</p></li></p><p><li><p>Decide whether to search by Cinema or Movie (I'm going with Cinema).</p></li></p><p><li><p>On the next page, select a state within Australia (I'm going with South </p><p>Australia).<br><br></p><p>Please note that on this screen, the "start over" button is located to the right of the </p><p>"continue" button. You know how we think of progressing to the right? Well, if you jump to </p><p>that right-hand button as you are so used to doing, you're back at the start of the process. </p><p>I'm an impatient guy, and I do this nearly every visit. ;p</p></li></p><p><li><p>Next page, choose the cinema location, and a date (I'm going with Norwood, and Tuesday </p><p>28 March - cheapskate tuesday, mmmmm).<br><br></p><p>Note that the "continue" button is on the far left again. Arghghhh.</p></li></p><p><li><p>And finally, we have the session times.</p></li></p><p></ol></p><p></p><p>So, what's that? 4 or 5 clicks? Maybe they remember (via a cookie, etc) which state and </p><p>cinema I chose, to speed up my next visit? Err, no... I have to repeat all those steps again </p><p>next time.</p></p><p><p>How could they simplify this process? Well, maybe put a search box on the frontdoor to </p><p>eliminate the selection of "What's On" every time. Or enable me to choose by cinema or movie, </p><p>AND my state at the same time. And the date of choice. That's easy enough, and drops one or </p><p>two unnecessary step.</p></p><p><p>They should also be "remembering" my location to better serve my needs on the next visit. </p><p>Their main competitor does this very effectively - when I hit their site, the movie times for </p><p>my preferred location are included on the frontdoor. Look mum, no clicks!</p></p><p></p><p><b>What can be learnt by the mistakes of those who designed this Web site?</b></p></p><p></p><ul></p><p><li><p>Always remember that most people naturally read towards the right, and also, think of </p><p>a form sequence in the same way. Progressive buttons should always be on the right-hand </p><p>side.</p></li></p><p><li><p>Take care to reduce an unnecessarily long process. Don't simplify the selection method </p><p>so much so that everyone is forced to click and wait 5+ times, just to find details which </p><p>should be the easiest to find on the entire Web site.</p></li></p><p><li><p>Especially, consider implementing cookies that remember the previous choices of a </p><p>user, and eliminate 90% of the process when they return.</p></li></p><p></ul></p><p>If you can think of any other way to improve the session time selection process on this </p><p>particular Web site, add a comment below.
