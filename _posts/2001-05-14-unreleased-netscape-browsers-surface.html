<p></p>Evolt.org is happy to announce the latest and rarest additions to our ever expanding <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org" target="_new">browser archive</a>: Netscape Navigator 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8.</p></p></p><p></p>Thanks to the contributions of people involved with the early development of the browser, we're now able to share the pre-beta versions of </p>the Netscape Navigator browser in the evolt.org browser archive. These alpha versions of Navigator are (as far as we know) the only copies </p>available on a publicly-accessible site anywhere on the Web. Although their practicality is limited, it's interesting to see how far</p>Web browsers have <em>really</em> come in every aspect of use and functionality.</p></p><p></p>That said, please note that the pre-0.9 releases of Navigator/Mozilla are considered *ALPHA*-quality browsers and are not intended for actual use.  They are listed here for historical purposes, not practical ones. You may find that some of the earliest releases don't even render HTML pages, throw random errors, and disrupt normal operations of your computer. Unfortunately, we're only able to offer the win16 (win 3.1) versions of these browsers. These versions should work on most Windows-based systems as well as emulation software for other operating systems (e.g. VMWare and WINE).</p></p></p><p></p>You can find the alpha versions at <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/index.cfm/dir/navigator/16bit/" target="_new">http://browsers.evolt.org/index.cfm/dir/navigator/16bit/</a> or check out our main browser archive listing as well at</p><a href="http://browsers.evolt.org" target="_new">browsers.evolt.org</a>. Have fun!</p></p>
