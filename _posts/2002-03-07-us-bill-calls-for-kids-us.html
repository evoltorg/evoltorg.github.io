<p>A congressional panel in the US has approved a bill which calls for a kid-friendly subdomain to be set up within the .us namespace. The panel believes that the region, to be kept free of violence and pornography, would enable easier screening of offensive material by parents.</p></p><p><p>One representative likened the concept to a children's section at a public library.</p></p><p><p>The action comes after the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers rejected the idea of a .kids top level domain in late 2000, after questions of how to best handle decision making in an international community were raised. The congressional panel, however, believes that the bill can instead force action within the .us namespace which lies under US government control.</p></p><p><p>News.com has more information available: <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-854745.html" title="House approves child-friendly domains (opens in a new window)" target="_blank">House approves child-friendly domains</a>.</p></p><p></p><p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><a href="mailto:isaac@triplezero.com.au">isaac</a><br /></p><a href="http://www.triplezero.com.au/" target="_blank">www.triplezero.com.au</a></p>
