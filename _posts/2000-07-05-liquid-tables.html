<p>How do you make a web page that looks good no matter how wide the browser window is?</p>Use liquid tables, a technique that lets you "pour" your content into the page so that</p>it flows to the margins, even if the window is resized.</p></p><p><p>Wait a sec, doesn't the good old HTML &lt;p&gt; tag allow content to flow?  Yes, but  </p>the problem is, you often need parts of the page to remain fixed, such as a </p>navigation bar down one side. The challenge is to have both a fixed and a flexible </p>portion of the page.</p>This is where liquid tables will help you.</p> </p><p><p>Let's start with some definitions:</p></p><blockquote></p><p><b>ice:</b> fixed width</p></p><p><b>jello:</b> somewhat flexible, often centered</p></p><p><b>liquid:</b> flexible width</p></p></blockquote>       </p><p><p>Here are a couple of good explanations of the basic differences </p>between these three techniques:</p></p><ul></p><li><p><a target="foo" href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212307,00.html">ice, jello, and liquid</a></p><br><small>http://whatis.techtarget.com/<br>&nbsp; WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212307,00.html</small></p></li></p><li><p><a target="foo" href="http://www.digital-web.com/tutorials/tutorial_1999-10.shtml">Liquid Web Design: Build it right and it will work no  matter what the container</a></p><br><small>http://www.digital-web.com/&nbsp;  tutorials/tutorial_1999-10.shtml</small></p></li></p></ul></p><p><p>The problem with an "ice" design, which might use a fixed table width of, say, 600 pixels,</p>is that if the browser window is narrower than 600, you get a horizontal scrollbar, and</p>if the browser window is very much wider than 600, you get a lot of white space.</p></p><p><p>One type of "jello" design also uses a fixed width table,</p>but centered in the window -- this looks somewhat better</p>when the browser window is substantially wider than the table.</p>Another type uses a table that is a certain percentage of the browser window, say 80%.</p>This allows the table to expand or contract depending on the width</p>of the browser window, and it minimizes the</p>amount of white space at all widths.  But it doesn't allow for </p>a fixed portion, that stays fixed -- for that, you need to use a liquid table.</p><p><p>The general approach to creating a liquid table is this:</p></p><ol></p><li><p>give pixel widths to fixed columns</p></li></p><li><p>give percentage widths to liquid columns</p></li></p></ol></p><p><p>However, you may still run into problems.  Some browsers</p>will disregard the pixel widths and try to "balance"</p>the widths of the columns.  Therefore you need</p>some way to "force" the liquid columns to expand</p>as much as possible.</p></p><p><p>Let's take a look at some techniques.  The following resources</p>give detailed explanations for how to build liquid tables:</p></p><ul></p><li><p><a target="foo" href="http://www.kallback.co.za/simply/float.htm">Simply - Liquid Tables</a></p><br><small>www.kallback.co.za/simply/float.htm</small></p></li></p><li><p><a target="foo" href="http://www.builder.com/Authoring/Tagmania/102599/?tag=st.cn.sr1.dir">Flexible Table Manners</a></p><br><small>www.builder.com/Authoring/&nbsp; Tagmania/102599/?tag=st.cn.sr1.dir</small></p></li></p><li><p><a target="foo" href="http://www.netmechanic.com/news/vol3/html_no2.htm">Unpredictable Column Widths</a></p><br><small>www.netmechanic.com/news/vol3/html_no2.htm</small></p></li></p><li><p><a target="foo" href="http://www.netmechanic.com/news/vol3/html_no3.htm">Making a Wild Card Column Width</a></p><br><small>www.netmechanic.com/news/vol3/html_no3.htm</small></p></li></p></ul></p><p><p>Note that one of the resources suggests that you <em>not</em></p>specify a percentage width for the table.  Does this work?  Yup, but</p>it assumes the liquid column has enough content to push the table out</p>to the window margins, otherwise the fixed column tends to </p>expand beyond its specified pixel width. Remember, browsers </p>regard column widths only as a recommendation, usually a minimum.</p>And they will happily override the stated width if necessary, and make</p>the fixed column either narrower or wider.</p></p><p><p>Another approach does not use</p>percentage widths for the liquid columns, but rather</p>an "absurd" fixed column width such as 2000 pixels.</p>This forces the liquid column to "squeeze"</p>the fixed column, thereby keeping it to its minimum width.</p>This technique assumes a table percentage width, which most browsers</p>(Opera is an exception) will honour -- specifying width=100% for the</p>table will "override" the absurdly large column width.</p>This technique probably dates back to HTML 3.2 when</p>percentages were not allowed on columns -- see the W3C</p><a target="foo" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32.html#table">HTML 3.2 table specs</a>.</p>Percentages for columns <em>are</em></p>valid in the</p><a target="foo" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.6">HTML 4</p>table specs</a>,</p>so it now makes sense to</p>give the liquid column a cell width of 90% or 100%.  But be warned that</p>older browsers may disregard these percentages if they</p>were written for HTML 3.2.</p></p><p><p>In either case you will probably need to ensure that </p>the fixed columns do not get squeezed narrower than their minimum </p>pixel widths, and the most reliable way seems to be to use</p>a transparent spacer gif.</p></p><p><p>Finally, with a truly liquid table, you will still have the problem</p>of long lines of text at very wide window widths.</p>One way to deal with this</p>is to use a table width of less than 100% -- say 80%.</p>This does not eliminate the problem of long lines of text,</p>it just reduces it.</p></p><p><p>The bottom line on liquid tables is  that you have to test your design.</p>Create a test page like this one --</p></p><ul></p><li><p><a target="foo" href="http://www.sam-i-am.com/misc/TestSuite/tables/flexible_width.html">Flexible Table test</a></p><br><small>www.sam-i-am.com/misc/TestSuite/tables/flexible_width.html</small></p></li></p></ul></p><p>Test your design in several browsers.
