<P> A year ago today, December 14th, circumstances made me realize  that the interests of the common Web developer weren't being served. I(and many others)revolted against the commercial establishment that claimed to  serve Web developers like myself. </P> <P>  <P> What were those circumstances? Many of you may in fact remember  the day one year ago that  <a href="http://members.evolt.org/djc/email.html">I suggested we start</a>  a mailing list and Web site not only for Web Developers, but <b>by</B>  Web Developers as well. The <a href="http://wired.lycos.com/" target="_new">corporate types</a>  made us realize that our merry little band of web monkeys weren't really a  community, but potential revenue and click-throughs. We wanted to show  the suits that we didn't need a corporate entity that paid writers  to produce Web development articles. We wanted to show them  that we,  the real live people who spend ungodly hours developing Web sites,  could provide a better resource to educate, inform, and help our  fellow developers than  they ever could. We wanted to show them we  could do it all for free, without the hindrance that having to turn  a profit brings. Most of all we wanted to show them, indeed the world,  that a community is only as good as its  motivation for becoming a community in the first place: to share and  foster common interests, problems, and ideas.  I believed that the  interests of the Web development community weren't (and still aren't)  being served by the commercial sites out there like Webmonkey and Builder.com.  Thankfully, <a href="http://evolt.org/faq/index.html#four">a group of people</a>  agreed with my post to the monkey list, responded, and we hatched the  plans for what was to become evolt.org... </P> <P>  <P> The first couple weeks were insane. Literally hundreds of ideas flying  around about just what kinds of things we could do. It was seriously  the most exciting time (professionally ;) of my life. After a couple months,  we settled down, and quietly began to understand just what an undertaking  we were getting into. </P> <P>  <P> You see, the buzzword these days is 'community'. I read articles  in all the trade magazines about creating  'online communities' and  steps one through eight on exactly how to do it. In reality though,  building a community of Web developers was a lot harder than it sounded.  In early March '98, the evolt 'community' consisted of about 25 people  all of whom were 'admin' members (those of us that take care of the day  to day operations of evolt). Not really impressive. You see (in retrospect),  we were too worried about what domain name to choose, what shade of  red our logo should have in it, and whether Cold Fusion or ASP was  the best choice for our Web site. We were too involved in the unimportant  parts of making a successful community  rather than actually doing what it  is we had set out to do in the first place. People ask me from time to time  what the secret of building a successful online community like evolt is.  A year ago, I would have replied something about having enough bandwidth  to serve all those people. Now I tell them that the single most   important thing about creating an online community is actually getting  all those people of common interests  together and talking; forget the details! </P> <P> <P> At any rate, we finally got some things decided, and put up a  <a href="http://lists.evolt.org">small mailing list</a> to discuss  Web development issues that same Spring. When we had <b>75 Web developers</B>  collaborating a short time later, I thought, "Geez, that's a lot of people, how cool!".  Then on June 1st, we launched our Web site,  <a href="http://evolt.org">http://evolt.org</a>  as a place where fellow Web developers could come and not  only read and learn  about current happenings, coding techniques, and development articles -  they could post about them as well. The evolt Web site relies on posts from  people like you to help out other developers, so   <a href="http://evolt.org/article/index.html?action=submit">share something</a>! </P> <P>  <P> Over the summer, our numbers grew steadily, and people started to  take notice that a bunch of disgruntled monkies had created a pretty  decent Web site and discussion list. A while later in August,   we introduced  the Internet's largest  <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org">browser archive</a> which some pretty  big Web sites took notice of and mentioned. Then we got published on  <a href="http://www.slashdot.org" target="_new">slashdot</a> and saw another   huge growth spurt, finding along the way that more Web developers  than ever were interested in the whats and whys of evolt. Our mailing  list has a reputation for being one of the best in the  industry, we're  an active and listened to voice, we're from the biggest design houses,  the best consulting firms, and have been quoted by industry leading publications. A year after  evolt's inception, the Web is starting to realize our dream.  They're starting to see that a group of  dedicated, active, and  enthusiastic individuals can become something larger than themselves.  That we  react in Internet Time. That we don't need a commercial focus  to succeed. That we don't need hype to attract interest.  That we <b>evolved.<I> That we did it.</I></B> </P> <P>  <P> So here we are a year later. Everything might sound peachy, but we're  still hungry. We still have lots of work to do, more developers  to help, more issues to raise our voice about. What's in the future  for evolt?  <P> <UL> <LI>Upgrades! Our link on slashdot.org made it all too apparent  that our current architecture (Access and Cold Fusion on NT if you're keeping score)  just can't handle the kind of traffic we're getting lately. Consequently,  we're moving to Linux, Cold Fusion, and Oracle. We're pretty confident  that we'll be able to keep up with the demand after this conversion.  If you're interested in our discussions on making this happen or have  something to contribute, feel free to join   <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/mailman/listinfo/thesite/">"thesite" mailing list</a>  we have set up for the backend workings of evolt.  We could always use the help!</LI> <br> <LI>Activism! Probably the thing that makes me most proud about  being an evolt member. Recently some evolt members got together to  voice their disgust with eToys.com -- read more about it at   <a href="http://www.etoys-sucks.com" target="_new">their Web site.</a></LI> <br> <LI>Improved content! We've recently started seeing some excellent  tutorials and articles from evolt  members on our Web site.  Without worry of compensation or recognition, it's those of you  that share your knowledge about the Web development industry with  your peers that truly embody the essence and principles of evolt.  A big thanks!</LI> <br> <LI>Fame, fortune, and hundred dollar bills y'all!!!  Well, this is the one thing you can count on <b>not</B> happening.  Evolt will never sell out, cash out, or bow out in response to  corporate offers. It would just go against the very reason evolt  was founded to do so. And besides, no one person owns or has  any claim to anything evolt, so the temptation is never there.  We are a community in the truest sense of the word. If you want  to show your appreciation, send beer and brownies! :^)</LI>  </UL> <P>  <P> Now without getting too sappy, I'd like to thank a couple  people here. First off, to the <a href="http://www.evolt.org/faq/index.html#four">admin</a>  group, past and present members. Thanks for putting up with my incoherent,  bitter, angry, emotional, drunken, stupid, self indulgent, proud, annoying,  and off topic email for the last year. Thanks for listening to the problems  I (and all of us) have shared, and helping through tough times. (Hopefully you won't have to listen to me bitch about no girlfriend anymore ;).  I've really learned a lot from each of you!  </P> <P>  <P> Second to <a href="http://www.taylor.org" target="_new">Taylor</a>,  <a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/hideout/staff.html" target="_new">Kristin Windbigler</a>,  and all the fine lawyer types at the former Wired Digital for giving us the  motivation to create evolt.org!!! Where would we be without you??  (You should really be getting around to putting a search engine on  that <a href="http://lists.hotwired.com/webmonkey/monkeyjunkies/" target="_new">archive</a> though!) </P> <P>  <P> Third to those of you that volunteer your time and energy to  making things happen. You know who you are! Also to those that  <a href="http://www.evolt.org/faq/index.html?menu=13#ten">dedicate bandwidth and server space</a>  to us, allowing evolt to worry more about content than paying bills. </P> <P>  <P> To <a href="http://www.jwz.org" target="_new">jwz</a> for inspiration, S.M.T. for more inspiration,  and Jim Morrison for even more inspiration. </P> <P>  <P> Finally to everyone involved with evolt for making evolt.org what  it is today: a truly successful community of Web developers!!!  </P> <P> <P> <P>
