<p>Anybody  who monitors their rankings with the same vigor that we in the SEO  community do will have noticed some fairly dramatic shifts in the  algorithm starting last Thursday (July 5th)  and continuing through the weekend.  Many sites are rocketing into  the top 10 which, of course, means that many sites are being dropped  at the same time.  We were fortunate not to have any clients on the  losing end of that equation however we have called and emailed the  clients who saw sudden jumps into the top positions to warn them that  further adjustments are coming.  After a weekend of analysis there  are some curiosities in the results that simply require further  tweaks in the ranking system.</p></p><p>This  update seems to have revolved around three main areas:  domain age,  backlinks and PageRank.</p></p><h2>Domain  Age</h2></p><p>It  appears that Google is presently giving a lot of weight to the age of  a domain and, in this SEO's opinion, disproportionately so.  While  the age of a domain can definitely be used as a factor in determining  how solid a company or site is, there are many newer sites that  provide some great information and innovative ideas.  Unfortunately a  lot of these sites got spanked in the last update.</p></p><p>On  this tangent I have to say that Google's use of domain age as a whole  is a good filter, allowing them to &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; sites on day one to  insure that they aren't just being launched to rank quickly for  terms.  Recalling back to the &ldquo;wild west days&rdquo; of SEO when  ranking a site was a matter of cramming keywords into content and  using questionable methods to generate links quickly I can honestly  say that adding in this delay was an excellent step that insured that  the benefits of pumping out domains became extremely limited.  So I  approve of domain age being used to value a site &ndash; to a point.</p></p><p>After  a period of time (let's call it a year shall we) the age should and  generally has only had a very small influence on a site's ranking  with the myriad of other factors overshadowing the site's whois data.   This appears to have changed in the recent update with age holding a  disproportionate weight.  In a number of instances this has resulted  in older, less qualified domains to rank higher than newer sites of  higher quality.</p></p><p>This  change in the ranking algorithm will most certainly be adjusted as  Google works to maximize the searchers experience.  We'll get into  the &ldquo;when&rdquo; question below.</p></p><h2>Backlinks</h2></p><p>The  way that backlinks are being calculated and valued has seen some  adjustments in the latest update as well.  The way this has been done  takes me back a couple years to the more easily gamed Google of old.   This statement alone reinforces the fact that adjustments are  necessary.</p></p><p>The  way backlinks are being valued appears to have lost some grasp on  relevancy and placed more importance on sheer numbers.  Sites with  large, unfocused reciprocal link directories are outranking sites  with fewer but more relevant link.  Non-reciprocal links lost the  &ldquo;advantages&rdquo; that they held over reciprocal links until recently. </p></p><p>Essentially  the environment is currently such that Google has made itself more  easily gamed than it was a week ago.  In the current environment,  building a reasonable sized site with a large recip link directory  (even unfocused) should be enough to get you ranking.  For obvious  reasons this cannot (and should not) stand indefinitely.</p></p><h2>PageRank</h2></p><p>On  the positive side of the equation, PageRank appears to have lost some  of its importance including the importance of PageRank as it  pertains to the value of a backlinks.  In my opinion this is a very  positive step on Google's part and shows a solid understanding of the  fact that PageRank means little in terms of a site's importance.   That said, while PageRank is a less than perfect calculation subject  to much abuse and manipulation from those pesky people in the SEO  community it did serve a purpose and while it needed to be replaced  it doesn't appear to have been replaced with anything of substantial  value. </p></p><p>A  fairly common belief has been that PageRank would be or is being  replaced by TrustRank and Google would not give us a green bar to  gague a site's trust on (good call Google).  With this in mind one of  two things has happened; either Google has decided the TrustRank is  irrelevant and so is PageRank and decided to scrap both (unlikely) or  they have shifted the weight from PageRank to TrustRank to some  degree and are just now sorting out the issues with their TrustRank  calculations (more likely).  Issues that may have existed with  TrustRank may not have been clear due to it's weight in the overall  algorithm and with this shift reducing the importance of PageRank the  issues that face the TrustRank calculations may well be becoming more  evident</p></p><p>In  truth, the question is neither here nor there (as important a  question as it may be).  We will cover why this is in the ...</p></p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>So  what does all of this mean?  First, it means that this Thursday or  Friday we can expect yet another update to correct some of the issues  we've seen rise out of the most current round.  This shouldn't  surprise anyone too much, we've been seeing regular updates out of  Google quite a bit over the past few months.</p></p><p>But  what does this mean regarding the aging of domains?  While I truly  feel that an aging delay or &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; is a solid filter on  Google's part &ndash; it needs to have a maximum duration.  A site from  2000 is not, by default, more relevant than a site from 2004.  After  a year-or-so the trust of a domain should hold steady or at most,  hold a very slight weight.  This is an area we are very likely to see  changes in the next update.</p></p><p>As  far as backlinks go, we'll see changes in the way they are calculated  unless Google is looking to revert back to the issues they had in  2003.  Lower PageRank, high relevancy links will once again surpass  high quantity, less relevant links.  Google is getting extremely good  and determining relevancy and so I assume the current algorithm  issues has more to do with the weight assigned to different factors  than an inability to properly calculate a links relevancy.</p></p><p>And  in regards to PageRank, Google will likely shift back slightly to  what worked and give more importance to PageRank, at least while they  figure out what went awry here. </p></p><p>In  short, I would expect that with an update late this week or over the  weekend we're going to see a shift back to last week's results (or  something very close to it) after which they'll work on the issues  they've experienced and launch a new (hopefully improved) algorithm  shift the following weekend.  And so, if you've enjoyed a sudden jump  from page 6 to top 3, don't pop the cork on the champaign too quickly  and if you've noticed some drops, don't panic.  More adjustments to  this algorithm are necessary and, if you've used solid SEO practices  and been consistent and varied in your link building tactics &ndash; keep  at it and your rankings will return.</p>
