Think you can beat Kasparov? Have a look at his latest <a href='http://www.zone.com/promo/kasparov/KasparovWelcome.asp'>challenge</a>.<p>\nIn a bold move, Kasparov challenges the world to beat him at chess. He will play a move, then four grandmasters will suggest counter-moves. The world will then vote online on which is to be played. Of course, strategy goes out the window on both sides, but it should be a larf.
