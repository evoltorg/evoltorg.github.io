<p>Although the disciplines of Information Design, Information Architecture are </p>  as old as the first human written documents and collections of them, they have </p>  developed in a large scale these last years in the context of web development. </p></p></p><p>Some people <a href="http://argus-acia.com/acia_event/morville_session.html" target="_foo">say</a> that after the era of information comes the era of the information </p>  architects, responsible for organizing such overwhelming amounts of information </p>  the web has allowed us to mobilize, recycle and create. And that this career </p>  will divide into several levels of specialization. It makes sense to me, so i've also jumped on the IA train.</p></p><p>The community of web developers hosted within this site has also felt and experienced </p>  the growth of this field. Time and experience has shown us the relevance of </p>  careful and deep work prior to the production stage in our projects. Some members </p>  have expanded our interests into this area, some have strong backgrounds in </p>  the field, others - like myself - have completely shifted their career towards </p>  this blooming discipline that feels so unexplored and attractive. </p></p><p>We already have <a href="http://www.evolt.org/topics/IA_Usability/4090/evolt.org</p>" target="_new">some articles</a> that fit the subject, but now we've considered </p>  it is the time to open a new <a href="http://www.evolt.org/topics/IA_Usability/4090/evolt.org</p>" target="_new">"center"</a> to host them and invite the rest of the </p>  IA/UE community to share their thoughts and research with our ever growing evolt.org. </p>
