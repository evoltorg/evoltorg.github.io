<p><b>Successful Development of Web  Applications</b></p>\n<p>Modern websites are a far cry from  the static text and graphics showcases of a decade ago, Today almost all  popular and successful websites today, be it online shopping portals, lead  management systems, surveys, event registration, reservation, and ticketing  systems, social networks, entertainment  sites, eCommerce websites implement web based applications. </p>\n<p>Web applications are computer  programs. These programs allow website visitors to submit and retrieve data to/from  a database over the Internet using a preferred web browser. The data is then  presented to the user within the browser as information is generated  dynamically by the web application through a web server.</p>\n<p>Web application development is not  necessarily an easy task. A properly developed web application must undergo a  series of actions to ensure success. </p>\n<p><b>The  5 Step Software Development Cycle</b><br>\n  The software development life cycle  normally comes with some standard processes which can be managed by a well-trained  development team. Like software, web site applications is also developed with a  certain methodologies. Let us look at the steps involved in most any web site  development projects.</p>\n<p><b>About the Author</b><br>\nGary  Klingsheim is the Vice President of Moonrise Production.

Analysis: <br>\n  As the web site is going to be a  part of a system, It needs a complete analysis as, how the web based  application is going to help the present system and how the site is going to  help the business. Moreover the analysis should cover all the aspects  especially what are the performance expectations of the finished product.  Another key aspect of the analysis is identifying and understanding the  targeted audience and their respective demographic. </p>\n<p>2. Identify Specifications: <br>\n  After the analysis, preliminary  specifications are drawn up by covering up each and every element of the  requirement. This specification document is then used by the design and  development team as a master plan ensuring the ongoing understanding of the  project requirements.</p>\n<p>3. Design:<br>\n  The Design step includes the  creation and design of all the pages implementing the application features as  design elements to be programmed later by the coding team. In most of the cases  customer may be interested in viewing two or three design versions. Revisions  are displayed via the web project board for the customer to view. In optimum  project management processes, customer comments, feedback and approvals are  submitted to a project management board for easy review and retrieval by all  relevant parties. Throughout the design phase the team should develop test  plans and procedures for quality assurance. It is necessary to obtain client  approval on design and project plans. Once approved the approved coded designs  are provided to the Programming team for development. </p>\n<p>4. Development:<br>\n  In parallel the Database team will  develop the database with all the data structures. Unlike traditional design  the coder must be familiar with the interface as the code should not change or  alter the look and feel of the site or application. It is important the  programming team and the designer interact and communicate well in order for  the programmer to thoroughly understand the design. The coders should always  produce necessary testing plans as well as technical documentation. The  end-user documentation can also be prepared by the coding team, which can be  used by a technical writer.</p>\n<p>5. Testing:<br>\n  Unlike software, web based  applications need intensive testing, as the applications will always function  as a multi-user system with bandwidth limitations. Some of the testing which  should be done are, Integration testing, Stress testing, Scalability testing,  load testing, resolution testing and cross-browser compatibility testing. Both  automated testing and manual testing should be done without fail. For example  its needed to test fast loading graphics and to calculate their loading time,  as they are very important for any web site. </p>\n<p>There are ideal testing tools which  assists quality assurance testers. After the testing is completed a live Beta  testing is necessary for web sites and web based applications. After uploading  the site a final testing is conducted. <br>\n  Successful  businesses have made intelligent use of web application development to enhance  their business prospects. However web application development should be handled  only by firms who have the experience and technological understanding to  undertake challenging application development . <br>\n  Once  your company requires an online application look for a web development with a  strong portfolio of clients that have an industry reputation. A strong <b>website  development</b> company can make any website effective.<br>
