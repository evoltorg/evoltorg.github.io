excerpt: "<p>The many reasons why home based internet businesses are booming and why anyone </p>  seeking financial freedom should seriously consider this unique business model.</p></p>"
---
<br><p>Internet businesses being run from home are booming&#8230; and they are set </p>  to expand in coming years as fast economically growing countries come on board </p>  to a much larger extent.</p></p><p> &#8220;Making tons of money in a home based business is not the only reason </p>  record numbers of people are starting home based Internet businesses. Home based </p>  business owners are finding a secondary benefit to owning a home business that </p>  is resulting in thousands of dollars in saved income taxes.&#8221;... Stone Evans </p>  - PluginProfitSite</p></p><p> So what is so good about an internet home based business?</p></p><p> What benefits does such an online business have over any other business?</p></p><p> What benefits does it have over a traditional &#8220;bricks and mortar&#8221; </p>  type business?</p></p><p> What benefits does it have over any other type of home based business, such </p>  as a multi level marketing business or a lawn mowing business or an accounting </p>  business?</p></p><p> Simply stated, starting an internet or home based business has three very </p>  clearly defined advantages which then lead to further benefits of which can </p>  not be obtained with other businesses.</p></p><p> These three advantages are&#8230;.</p></p><p> 1. Potential income earnings and market growth <br></p>  2. Low initial monetary outlay or business setup costs. <br></p>  3. The ability to work on your business part time.</p></p><p><strong>Potential Income Earning and Market Growth</strong></p></p><p> Saying that business online has grown rapidly since inception of the internet, </p>  is not only a fact but also an understatement.</p></p><p> Constant news of increased spending online litters the news on a weekly basis, </p>  more people buying a much wider variety of goods, services and niche market </p>  products.</p></p><p>Additional markets that were not present on the web five years ago are now </p>  not only opening up but expanding at huge rates. Countries such as Chile, China, </p>  India and even Bulgaria are now online and their economies are growing at staggering </p>  rates. China and India would have to be the prominent leaders to date with their </p>  economies currently growing between eight to ten percent per year! - <a href="http://www.adb.org/Documents/Speeches/2006/ms2006046.asp" target="_blank">Regional and Global Implications of the Rapid Economic Growth...</a></p></p><p>Such figures are shown through increases of people subscribing to internet </p>  services and companies expanding their digital networks. - <a href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3618336" target="_blank"> </p>  Digital Opportunity Increases Worldwide</a></p></p><p>Many people in these countries now wish to have all the benefits that we in </p>  the west have been experiencing for many years. The house, the car, the TV, </p>  the microwave, the computer and the internet and all the benefits that such </p>  technologies can bring, not withstanding status within their given society.</p></p><p>In addition, our own society has become much more familiar with the internet </p>  and the many benefits it brings. Expanded communication with friends and family, </p>  social forums and discussion lists on all sorts of topics, even dating is now </p>  a huge industry online.</p></p><p>This familiarity is now facilitating a trust of all things internet related </p>  and thus people are turning to purchases online with much less trepidation than </p>  years gone past.</p></p><p>And to put that in dollar terms, online spending has risen from $41.2 billion </p>  in 2002 to $79.2 billion in 2005 with increases expected to continue. - <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921857.html" target="_blank">Online </p>  Consumer Spending by Product, 2002 - 2004</a>, <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0933517.html" target="_blank">Online </p>  Computer Spending by Kind of Business, 2003 - 2005</a></p></p><p>Total people shopping online has gone from 66 million in 2002 to an estimated </p>  136 million in 2007.</p></p><p>The fact that people are looking for such a wide variety of information has </p>  allowed thousands of solopreneurs working from home to earn more than better </p>  incomes. Incomes are being made from people offering information on their hobbies, </p>  their current business skills and many other tangible and intangible products.</p></p><p>Even people without their own products are bringing in profits by selling other </p>  companies goods and services, or even just selling advertising.</p></p><p>The potential for already established offline businesses is also huge. A good </p>  example of this is the tourism industry whereby most of the major players such </p>  as airlines, governments of major tourist destinations and some major hotel </p>  chains have been quick to capitalize on internets growth.</p></p><p>However there are a staggering amount of businesses of varying sizes that are </p>  missing huge opportunities to substantially increase customers and profits by </p>  developing and marketing their business online. This includes hotels, restaurants, </p>  clubs, sporting, leisure and health services just to name a few.</p></p><p>The fact is, no matter your current business size &#8211; online or off, your </p>  current experience with business &#8211; a lot or none, whether you wish to </p>  have a business working from home or start with an office, there is no rival </p>  for the potential of income or growth in any form in the world today.</p></p><p><strong>Low Initial Monetary Outlay or Business Setup Costs</strong></p></p><p>Cost to start a restaurant? $100,000 to $1 million. <br></p>  Cost to setup a shop in a major shopping centre? Maybe a little less than the </p>  above. <br></p>  Cost to start a service business from home, say a carpenter? All your tools, </p>  advertising and insurance plus many extra&#8217;s, maybe 10 to $20,000.</p></p><p>How much to start an online business?</p></p><p>A website (domain name) and hosting - $100 dollars a year.</p></p><p>However, if you have no experience with the internet there will be additional </p>  costs such as learning materials and additional software. All up you may spend </p>  anywhere between 1 to $5,000.</p></p><p>The experimentation and implementation of an online business or web based business </p>  is affordable for the average working person, something that cannot be said </p>  of traditional business due to the usual immense start up costs.</p></p><p>Even the running costs of an internet business are so little compared to traditional </p>  costs. Then there are the advertising and marketing costs to consider, much </p>  lower than what offline business pays and something that they are even yet to </p>  fully comprehend.</p></p><p><strong>The Ability To Work On Your Business Part Time</strong></p></p><p>I have left this section to the last, why?</p></p><p>It represents why many people don&#8217;t go into business&#8230;. risk!</p></p><p>In most cases building and starting a business means taking many risks. A loan </p>  may be required, extensive experience in your business field, applying yourself </p>  to the business full time without backup income or another job, putting on employee&#8217;s </p>  and the list goes on.</p></p><p>An internet home based business can be started and established while still </p>  working a full time job.</p></p><p>It therefore eliminates risk from your daily life.</p></p><p>The mortgage payments, the kids schooling, the income to the house and your </p>  current lifestyle are in no way threatened. The business can be worked on part </p>  time from home, at the point that it establishes enough income to live off, </p>  your full time work can then be terminated.</p></p><p>If ever there was a time where the initial outlay in terms of money, time and </p>  risk to start a business was the least, now is that time and the internet is </p>  the platform.</p></p><p>No matter your experience or subject knowledge, there is money and a very good </p>  living to be made online whether you are an established business or wish to </p>  build an internet home based business.</p></p><p>Will you be grabbing your share today?</p>
