From this <a href="http://www.wininformant.com/display.asp?ID=2980" target="_blank">article</a> on wininformant.com, it looks like Internet Explorer 6 might be coming with the Whistler betas or soon thereafter, and it's supposed to contain elements of the new MSN Explorer [Ed note, see <a href="http://www.evolt.org/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=3618&catid=21" target="_blank">article on MSN Explorer</a> earlier this week], along with media and IM bundled (built in?).</p><p>What remains to be seen is if they'll fully support W3C or CSS1/2, and whether they'll finally add SVG support.</p><p>My bets are that they finally will support XSL 100% with the 'gold' release of the MSXML parser, which was released October 31st.
