<P>\nMacromedia, Inc. announced today the release of <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/ultradev/" target="_new">Macromedia Dreamweaver UltraDev</a>, a visual Web application development tool\n             which looks to compete with products such as Microsoft's Visual InterDev and Adobe's GoLive.\n</P>\n<P>\nWith support for Cold Fusion Markup Language, Active Server Pages, and Java Server Pages, UltraDev jumps out as the front runner in cross-language development tools. UltraDev also has functionality to link to any ODBC, ADO, or JDBC datasource and can take advantage of COM objects and JavaBeans.\n</P>\n<P>\nCheck out the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2000/index_dwultradev.fhtml" target="_new">press release</a> from Macromedia for more marketing info. It sounds like this is built on top of Drumbeat, which Macromedia purchased some time ago and has all the functionality of Dreamweaver 3. Sadly, only Mac and Windows ports at this time. More information as it becomes available..
