<P>In an opinion article today, Dave Winer contemplates,  <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$317" target="_new">"Why developers want HTML rendering in the OS"</a> and goes on to explain his experience of sending an email to a group of people. The great thing was, according to Dave, this email included  a piece of Javascript that made a call back to a server where it could run a random banner-ad  type script, which naturally, displayed a random banner ad right there in your email client!</P> </p><P> Dave goes on to give a brief explanation of how this all happened, drops the expected Linux references, and summarizes with thanks to Microsoft for providing the software that is "enabling the revolution." </P> </p><P> Revolution? To any security minded person, this is more of a nightmare! How does javascript embedded email constitute a revolution? If anything, allowing javascript to be executed by your email client is a serious compromise of the security of your system. However, I'm not here to talk about the security issues surrounding scriptable email messages, that's been beaten to death already on <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com" target="_new">BugTraq</a>: </P></p><P></p><UL></p><LI><a href="http://pages.whowhere.lycos.com/computers/cuartangojc/mailto.html" target="_new">Attaching local files to a mailto: link</A></LI></p><LI><a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&date=2000-02-1&msg=3896E440.553BD289@nat.bg" target="_new">Active Scripting may read email messages</a></LI></p><LI><a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&date=1998-08-1&msg=Pine.SUN.4.01.9808071510270.2981-100000@dfw.nationwide.net" target="_new">Running an executable attachment through what appears to be a valid HTML link</a></LI></p><LI><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-001.asp" target="_new">Forms ActiveX control advisory</a></LI></UL> </p></P></p><P>On top of the security issues listed above, imagine what kind of javascript enabled spam you could get from people! Now instead of spam email that has a link to the "Make Money Fast" website, your javascript enabled email client parses a document.open function that calls up the "Make Money Fast" website in your browser? Porn pop up windows anyone? You get the idea.. </P></p><P>Which developers want HTML email - much less javascript enabled email - in their inbox? The majority of developer mailing lists in fact <I>discourage</I> sending any sort of non-text email, including HTML and javascript encoded email. Why does Dave make such a broad statement claiming that this is what "Developers" want? I am a developer, and Dave sure as hell doesn't speak for me. This article appeared on <a href="http://www.scripting.com" target="_new">scripting.com</a>, but I doubt many  scripting developers would agree with Dave either. A casual reader, teacher, or executive might stumble across a site about scripting such as scripting.com and think that what Dave is saying is <b>in fact</B> what people that 'script' and 'develop' want. <!--But the discussion about the use of a generic domain name to promote a specific product line and one persons opinion is for another time.--> </P></p><P> In summary, I think Dave (as well as companies like Microsoft) should think more about the security and privacy issues that surround a topic like this, and protect us as users first <b>before</b> developing functionality that might put our sensitive information at risk trough the  use of an insecure technology such as scriptable email. </P>
