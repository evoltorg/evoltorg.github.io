The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (<a href="http://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>) in Australia is developing an artificial intelligence that learns from past shopping        experiences to adapt and provide users with a better shopping "agent".</p><p>The AI will be able to assist users who are normally overwhelmed by the vast number of choices which usually face online shoppers. According to one of CSIRO's artificial intelligence researchers, Maria Lee, "It is able to negotiate the best deal, make suggestions and leave the final decision to buy up to you."</p><p>It is expected that commercial trials of the software will begin soon.</p><p>You can read some more information about the e-commerce agent at <a href="http://www.newswire.com.au/0005/csiro.htm">Newswire</a>.</p><p>\n<a href="mailto:isaac@triplezero.com.au">isaac</a>
