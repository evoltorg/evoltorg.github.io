Universal Pictures has asked an Ottawa resident not to link to their copyrighted movie trailers from his web site.  Worse news: he complied.  Universal's lawyers sent letters.  Might makes right?  There'd not be much of a web if we're prohibited from posting links like <a href="http://www.globetechnology.com/archive/gam/News/19990812/TWLINK.html">this one</a> to the article at the Globe and Mail.
