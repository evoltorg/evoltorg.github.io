<p><b>Q. What is a server log?</b><br></p>  A. Server logs are very useful in helping you undestand the impact of your web </p>  site, and in better positioning your web site to attract new and repeat visitors. </p>  Each log records an individual request of a file on a web site (be it HTML, </p>  GIF, JPG, PDF, etc). On first glance a log looks like a bunch of numbers and </p>  letters. Depending on how your server logs are recorded, a collection of logs </p>  may tell you such things as:</p></p><ul></p>  <li> Which pages of your web site were viewed, and how often,</li></p>  <li> How many visits your web site received,</li></p>  <li> Which sections/pages of your site were most popular during a given period </p>    of time (say a week or a month),</li></p>  <li> Where your visitors came from (in some cases),</li></p>  <li> What browsers and platforms (operating systems) they were using,</li></p>  <li> What times of the day and days of the week your server is busiest,</li></p>  <li> What keyword searches lead people to your site,</li></p>  <li> What errors people are encountering,</li></p>  <li> On which pages people are most frequently entering your site,</li></p>  <li> How long the average "view time" was for a given web page,</li></p>  <li> Who your most frequent visitors are (in some cases),</li></p>  <li> and possibly more. </li></p></ul></p><b>Q. I've heard people describe their site's popularity in terms of "hits". What </p>does that mean?</b><br></p>A. The number of "hits" a site receives can be a misleading way to judge its popularity. </p>It is important that you understand each of the following terms: </p><ul></p>  <li><b>Hit:</b> A hit is counted when any file is accessed during a user session, </p>    whether it is an HTML page, a graphic, or another file type. In other words, </p>    accessing an HTML page with five graphics will count as six hits. Also, if </p>    a user reloads a page during a session, it is counted as a fresh hit (or hits) </p>    (likewise when a user restarts their browser and then revisits a page).</li></p>  <li><b>Page View:</b> A view is counted when an HTML file is accessed during </p>    a user session, independent of graphics on the page. In other words, accessing </p>    an HTML page with five graphics will count as one view. For each visit to </p>    a given HTML page during a user session, it is counted as one view for the </p>    entire session (regardless of the actual times the HTML page was viewed by </p>    that user during that session). Also, if a user reloads a page during a session, </p>    it is counted as a fresh view (likewise when a user restarts their browser </p>    and then revisits a page).</li></p>  <li><b>User Sessions:</b> A session of activity (all hits and views) for one </p>    visitor to a web site. A unique user is determined by the IP address. A user </p>    session is terminated when a user is inactive for more than 30 minutes (depending </p>    on your hardware/software), or when the user quits their browser.</li></p>  <li><b>Home Page Views:</b> Number of requested views of the home page during </p>    a given period. If a user visits the home page during their user session, </p>    it is counted as one view for the entire session (regardless of the actual </p>    times the home page was viewed by that user during that session).</li></p>  <li><b>Entire Site Hits:</b> The number of hits to the entire site for the given </p>    period, including all graphics, HTML files, and other file types (such as </p>    PDF).</li></p></ul></p><b>Q. How do I locate my server's logs?</b><br></p>A. You must first find out if your server is dedicated to your web site, or if </p>it is a multi-homed domain (hosts other web sites with other "root" web addresses </p>-- or www.yourname.com vs. www.theirname.com). The answer will determine whether </p>all the logs you'll find on the server represent your web site (you're in luck), </p>or might contain logs for multiple sites (your logs _might_ be mixed in). Also, </p>if your web site is part of a larger whole, your logs are likely to be interspersed </p>with those of the whole site. </p><p>If you don't run the server yourself (and/or know the answer), you need to </p>  ask the person running the server (through your ISP, employer etc.) about the </p>  state of your logs. In the worst case scenario - you have no server manager </p>  to ask - you should be able to tell by looking at the logs themselves whether </p>  your logs are separate or mixed with other sites.</p></p><p><b>Q. Okay, I've determined my situation (or will once I see the logs). What </p>  next?</b><br></p>  A. Next you'll have to find the actual folder the logs reside in on the server. </p>  While I can't tell you the exact location (every server has the possibility </p>  of being organized differently), I can suggest the following strategies:</p></p><ul></p>  <li> Ask your ISP or server manager for log access and location, or</li></p>  <li> Do a search/find on your server for folders/files called "log" or "logs". </p>    Look for a folder first, as it may contain files also called "log" or "logs".</li></p></ul></p><p>You may have to look around a bit to find them, but once you do the folder </p>  is likely to contain dozens or even hundreds of files. The files are typically </p>  organized by date. For example, our logs for the beginning of July 1999 are </p>  called:</p></p><blockquote> </p>  <p> in990701.log<br></p>    in990702.log<br></p>    in990703.log<br></p>    in990704.log (etc.)</p></p></blockquote></p><p>Yours may be called something entirely different. When you open the file, you </p>  will see a collection of individual logs for that date, one per line, containing </p>  all the data you need. An individual log file will look something like:</p></p><p><code>a-xix.wincom.net, -, 7/11/99, 9:12:03, W3SVC, AGNR, www.agnr.umd.edu, </p>  10453, 328, 5354, 200, 0, GET, /users/CMREC/2-6ART4.HTM, Mozilla/4.03 [en] (Win95; </p>  I), http://www.lycos.com/cgi- bin/pursuit?query=grub+control&cat=dir, -, -, </p>  </code></p></p><p><b>Q. Some of that looks familiar, but what does it all mean?</b><br></p>  A. Let's take it piece by piece. For starters, depending on your system each </p>  tidbit is separated by commas, or simply by a blank space. The log above came </p>  from a Windows NT server, and yours may look significantly different. A dash </p>  (-) indicates no data for that category. </p></p><p>There are seven basic (or common) fields in most logs, and the server software </p>  may be configured to collect additional data, resulting (naturally) in additional </p>  fields. I've included a large number of the possible additional fields for further </p>  clarification (for those of you who have them). There may be other fields not </p>  covered below.</p></p><p> I'll be up front about the fact that your log fields may be in a completely </p>  different order than represented above. This can really become a headache when </p>  trying to decipher which field is which. If you have access to server documentation, </p>  it should help (though in the case of MS IIS, the documentation I have really </p>  doesn't help...big surprise there). I should add that the WebTrends site has </p>  a great <a href="http://www.webtrends.com/support/Solution.asp?id=611841082">glossary</a> </p>  of log report related terms (but it's still not comprehensive).</p></p><ol></p>  <li> <b>Clients IP address:</b> <code>a-xix.wincom.net</code><br></p>    The host is the user's server that requested the data (page). In our case </p>    the host's IP address has been resolved into a server name. In your case, </p>    the host may be represented by a server name or an IP number (such as 186.255.255.1). </p>    Whichever you get reflects whether your server is set up to "resolve" (look </p>    up) IP addresses. </li></p>  <li><b>Clients Username:</b> <code>-</code> (in our case no data was recorded)<br></p>    This field is reserved for the identification of the person's user name. This </p>    field is rarely used, and data which appears in it can be faked, so in most </p>    cases it's worth ignoring.</li></p>  <li><b>Date (mm/dd/yy):</b> <code>7/11/99</code><br></p>    This field can record the date in various formats.</li></p>  <li><b>Time:</b> <code>9:12:03</code><br></p>    This field can record the time in various formats, and can include the offset </p>    from GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) at the end. Ours doesn't include the GMT offset, </p>    but if it did, it would say something like -0400 (for US Eastern Standard </p>    Time, 4 hours behind GMT in the summer) or +0700.</li></p>  <li><b>Service:</b><code> W3SVC</code><br></p>    Um, I think this indicates the kind of service the server is configured to </p>    offer (?)</li></p>  <li><b>Computer name:</b> <code>AGNR</code><br></p>    Name given the host server. In our case, AGNR stands for the College of Agriculture </p>    and Natural Resources.</li></p>  <li><b>Server IP address (Multihome domain field):</b> <code>www.agnr.umd.edu</code><br></p>    As indicated, this is either the IP address of the server or in its resolved </p>    form (the actual URL).</li></p>  <li><b>Processing time:</b> <code>10453</code><br></p>    How long it took the server to process the request in milliseconds.</li></p>  <li><b>Bytes recieved:</b> <code>328</code><br></p>    Data received from the client.</li></p>  <li> <b>Bytes sent: </b><code>5354</code><br></p>    Size of file sent to client. If the field contained a "-" or a "0", this probably </p>    means that header information only was requested (most often used by spiders </p>    and bots).</li></p>  <li><b>Status Code:</b> <code>200</code><br></p>    200 in particular reflects a successful file transfer. This code could be </p>    anything from 1xx to 5xx, depending on the action resulting from the file </p>    request. In brief, actions are: </li></p>  <blockquote> </p>    <p>1xx - continue<br></p>      2xx - success<br></p>      3xx - redirect (also a success)<br></p>      4xx - client error (failure)<br></p>      5xx - server error (failure)<br></p>      (for information on specific numbers, please see <a href="http://www.tvpress.com/promote/server/">this </p>      page</a>.)</p></p>  </blockquote></p>  <li><b>Windows NT status Code:</b> <code>0</code><br></p>    Okay, I'm clueless, and the documentation is of no help!</li></p>  <li><b>Operation:</b> <code>GET</code><br></p>    This records the type of request from the client's browser to the server. </p>    Types of requests can include: </li></p>  <blockquote> </p>    <p>GET - requests the file in its entirety<br></p>      HEAD - requests the header information of the file <br></p>      POST - places a file on the server</p></p>  </blockquote></p>  <li><b>Target file:</b> <code>/users/CMREC/2-6ART4.HTM</code><br></p>    This indicates the path to the requested file.</li></p>  <li><b>Browser/Platform:</b> <code>Mozilla/4.03 [en] (Win95; I)</code><br></p>    Indicates which browser and platform the visitor was using. Mozilla is the </p>    same as Netscape Navigator. When there is additional info such as in "<code>Mozilla/4.0 </p>    (compatible; MSIE 4.01; AOL 4.0; Windows 95)</code>" this usually indicates </p>    that it was MSIE masquerading as Netscape (happens sometimes). Alternatively, </p>    this field could record a visiting spider.</li></p>  <li><b>Referring URL:</b> <code>http://www.lycos.com/cgi- bin/pursuit?query=grub+control&amp;cat=dir</code><br></p>    This indicates who referred the visitor or bot to the web page, thus telling </p>    you from where your visitors are coming. In this case, the visitor came from </p>    a search engine (Lycos), and you have the added benefit of knowing which words </p>    they were using for the search ("grub control" - yummy!).</li></p>  <li><b>Script or dll variables:</b> <code>-</code> (in our case no data was </p>    recorded)</li></p></ol></p><p><b>Q. Do I have to go through each and every log to figure that stuff out and </p>  calculate my statistics?</b><br></p>  A. I certainly hope not! You could try using software to analyze your server </p>  logs and create reports for you. I've used freeware including the popular <a href="http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/%7Esret1/analog/">Analog</a> </p>  and the less known <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/wwwstat/">WWWStat</a>. </p>  Netscape has a <a href="http://directory.netscape.com/Computers/Software/Internet/Site_Management/Log_Analysis/">comprehensive </p>  list</a> of links to similar software. I've also had the great pleasure of using </p>  <a href="http://www.webtrends.com/">WebTrends Log Analyzer</a>, a top-of-the-line </p>  tool that has a wide variety of capabilities and functions. I have found it </p>  worth the money, especially because my employer paid for it. <br></p>  <br></p>  If you want to use a good utility for finding and counting your log information, </p>  I hear "<a href="http://search.netscape.com/cgi-bin/search?search=grep">grep</a>" </p>  is a great tool built into UNIX boxes, and downloadable for the Mac. I've not </p>  used it, so I can't personally vouch for it. A final alternative would be to </p>  use the search or find feature around various parameters. I'm not going to go </p>  into the specifics of any of these options, in the hopes that any supporting </p>  documentation that comes with the software/your system will be sufficient in </p>  helping you perform your chosen task. When all else fails, call tech support. </p></p></p><p><b>Conclusion</b><br></p>  I hope this brief introduction to server logs has been helpful. I've acquired </p>  this information from working with logs, from server and software manuals, a </p>  wonderful tech-support worker, and from the various software packages mentioned </p>  above. If you're interested in learning more about server logs and how to use </p>  them to boost the number of visitors to your web site, I would highly recommend </p>  that you read "<a href="http://www.tvpress.com/promote/">Increase Your Web Traffic </p>  in a Weekend</a>" by Willliam R. Stanek. Compared with the wealth of information </p>  he provides, not just on server logs but on numerous ways to greatly enhance </p>  your site's performance, I have barely scratched the surface.</p></p><p>If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:marlene@members.evolt.org?subject=server%20log%20basics">contact </p>  me</a>.</p>
