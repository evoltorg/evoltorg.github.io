Starting with the communication ends that online media support, he moved back through design, HTML and server-side code. Then he got into running the whole show.
These days he\'s working for <a href=\"http://www-5.ibm.com/services/uk/services/bcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these people</a> as a Project Manager, and still thinks (nearly 6 years on) it\'s a hell of a lot better than working for a dot-com. In his Copious Free Time&trade;, he helps out running a <a href=\"http://www.purpur.co.uk/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloth Nappies</a> online store.

<p>Amongst his favourite things is <del><strike><a href=\"http://www.zope.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">Zope</a></strike></del><ins><a href=\"http://drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal</a></ins>, which he uses to run his <a href=\"http://www.easyweb.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">personal site</a>. He\'s starting to (re)gain a sneaking regard for ECMAscript since the arrival of unobtrusive scripting.</p> 

<p>He\'s been a member of evolt.org since the very early days, a board member, a president, a writer and even contributed a modest amount of template code for the current site. Above all, he likes evolt.org to do things because it knowingly chooses to do so, rather than randomly stumbling into them. He\'s also one of the boys and girls who beervolts in the UK, although the arrival of small children in his life have knocked the frequency for 6.</p>

Computer giant IBM is working with companies such as regional telephone operator Bell Atlantic to sell wiring systems that will provide a broadband, multimedia network for new homes according to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_357000/357103.stm" target="_new">the BBC</a><p></p>The IBM/Bell Atlantic system consists of a multimedia network hub installed in the basement of the home. <p></p><p>The backbone of the system is two coaxial cables, a Category 5 Ethernet cable and advanced multi-line phone wiring. These cables are connected to multimedia "ports" or outlets, which come in several configurations. </p><p></p>Audio-visual signals and computer data can be sent across the system, and the network supports multiple telephone lines. The network is designed to support future home theatre, computer network and Internet applications.</p><p></p>All of the home owners opt to have at least one room equipped with a multimedia port that supports multiple phone lines for a home office, but about 20% of the home owners choose to have the full computer networking option installed.
