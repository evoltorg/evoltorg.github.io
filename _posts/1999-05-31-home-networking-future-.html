Computer giant IBM is working with companies such as regional telephone operator Bell Atlantic to sell wiring systems that will provide a broadband, multimedia network for new homes according to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_357000/357103.stm" target="_new">the BBC</a><p>\nThe IBM/Bell Atlantic system consists of a multimedia network hub installed in the basement of the home. <p></p><p>The backbone of the system is two coaxial cables, a Category 5 Ethernet cable and advanced multi-line phone wiring. These cables are connected to multimedia "ports" or outlets, which come in several configurations. \n<p>\nAudio-visual signals and computer data can be sent across the system, and the network supports multiple telephone lines. The network is designed to support future home theatre, computer network and Internet applications.\n<p>\nAll of the home owners opt to have at least one room equipped with a multimedia port that supports multiple phone lines for a home office, but about 20% of the home owners choose to have the full computer networking option installed.
