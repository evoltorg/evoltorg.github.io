The <a href="http://www.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a> announced yesterday that the current state of affairs with the US patent system may be set to change. The US Patent and Trademark Office are looking at ways they can change their system in order to set in place new checks preventing the granting of patents for already existing techniques.</p><p>While such changes almost certainly won't affect existing patent decisions such as the Amazon One-Click shopping patent, it may help prevent the situation from happening again. (The article sites the case of Compton New Media who tried to register a patent for "software combining text, audio and video in a multimedia compact disk". They were granted the patent, but fortunately it was revoked after complaints from industry professionals.</p><p><a href="http://public.wsj.com/news/hmc/sb954286078412266261.htm">http://public.wsj.com/news/hmc/sb954286078412266261.htm</a>
