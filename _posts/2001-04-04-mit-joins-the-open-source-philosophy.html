<p>MIT joins the Open Source philosophy</p>\n<p>In an article titled "<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/nr/2001/ocw.html" target="_blank">MIT \n  to make nearly all course materials available free on the World Wide Web</a>" \n  the The Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced the new project for \n  the publication of all their material in the next ten years. In their own words \n  "the project expects to provide materials for over 2,000 courses across \n  MIT's entire curriculumï¿½in architecture and planning, engineering, humanities, \n  arts, social sciences, management, and science." </p>\n<p>This is a big step towards the transformation of our culture to a more collaborative environment. Just as evolt (and many more) has done they are using the power of the Internet in a giving way, allowing all their knowlerdge to be shared. I believe that the Internet will help us change from out current mood of competition towards one of more collaboration, this is a great time.</p>
