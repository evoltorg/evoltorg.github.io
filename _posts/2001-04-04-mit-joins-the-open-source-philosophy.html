<p>MIT joins the Open Source philosophy</p></p><p>In an article titled "<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/nr/2001/ocw.html" target="_blank">MIT </p>  to make nearly all course materials available free on the World Wide Web</a>" </p>  the The Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced the new project for </p>  the publication of all their material in the next ten years. In their own words </p>  "the project expects to provide materials for over 2,000 courses across </p>  MIT's entire curriculumï¿½in architecture and planning, engineering, humanities, </p>  arts, social sciences, management, and science." </p></p><p>This is a big step towards the transformation of our culture to a more collaborative environment. Just as evolt (and many more) has done they are using the power of the Internet in a giving way, allowing all their knowlerdge to be shared. I believe that the Internet will help us change from out current mood of competition towards one of more collaboration, this is a great time.</p>
