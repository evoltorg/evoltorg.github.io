<p>Not so long ago, I got introduced to server side scripting for websites. I </p>  really began to enjoy myself. I could create my HTML and go around embedding </p>  my neat little &lt;%%&gt; asp tags. Man... it was fun. Then came a time when </p>  the client wanted me to change some of the visual design. &quot;Just move </p>  this image from over here to there...&quot; That's when my nightmares began.</p></p><p>It turned out to be an experience just about as pleasant as piercing needles </p>  through your eyes. Somewhere down the line my embedded ASP got jumbled. Something </p>  had to be wrong with what I was doing. </p></p><p>I needed a framework that would allow:</p></p><ul></p>  <li>Single point of modification for templates on a site</li></p>  <li>Some kind of templating. I didn't want to use templating features of a specific </p>    HTML editor, since a lot of the time I end up editing html manually</li></p>  <li>Separate ASP from HTML</li></p>  <li>Allow reusability.</li></p></ul></p><h2>Some Nuclear Physics</h2></p><p>The first part of our technique is basically about breaking up an HTML page </p>  into usable bits, when we need to display it on the website (some HTML Fission).</p></p><p>The second part is about rejoining the various bits, when we need to see the </p>  HTML as a whole (some HTML Fusion).</p></p><h2>Fission</h2></p><p>Why do I breakup a decent HTML page into pieces? There are quite a few advantages </p>  to this. For one, most websites have a common look and feel throughout, but </p>  when the look does need to change I would like to make it in 1 place.   Sometimes </p>  only small things need to be changed like a navigation menu moving from the </p>  left hand side of the page to the right hand side. And many times the only  thing different </p>  between look and feel of pages is something technically minor like the banner </p>  table being a 3-column table instead of a single column table, I didn't want </p>  to maintain a duplicate of the page template just to accommodate stuff like</p>this.</p></p><p>There are  additional advantages to this scheme. It's very easy to provide </p>  additional features like &quot;print version&quot; and also hidden/alternate </p>  navigation on specific pages. </p></p><h3>Fissile Material</h3></p><p>A typical page layout for my example would look like:</p></p><p><img src="images/20519/23170/page_template.gif" width="352" height="151" border="0" alt="image sample page layout" /></p></p><p>As you can see I have divided the page into manageable tables.</p></p><p>I break up the page further to my convenience by demarcating specific parts </p>  of the page. For example, I mark the starting of the page header into 3 parts in </p>  the following way:</p></p><pre>&lt;!--[_part_start_:000.01.head_beg]--&gt;</p>  &lt;html&gt;</p>  &lt;head&gt;</p>  &lt;title&gt;&lt;!--_VAR_TITLE_--&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</p>  &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=iso-8859-1&quot;&gt;</p>&lt;!--[_part_start_:000.02.head_scr]--&gt;</p>&lt;script&gt;</p>function dummy()</p>{</p>return 0;</p>}</p>&lt;/script&gt;</p>&lt;!--[_part_start_:000.99.head_end]--&gt;</p>&lt;/head&gt; </p></pre></p><p>As you can see I divided the HTML by using comment tags named in a particular </p>  way: <br></p>  <strong><code>&lt;!--[_part_start_:xxx.xx.section_name]--&gt;</code></strong>. </p>  I used a naming convention as it allows me to later extract specific sections </p>  of this file using regular expressions. There are  certain advantages to </p>  using a naming schema based on comment tags. For one, most HTML editors find </p>  them palatable and generally don't screw around with them (though personally I</p>use the editor to make the initial layout, after that I hand-edit it...). </p></p></p><p>There is also a comment called <code>&lt;!--_VAR_TITLE_--&gt;</code> within </p>  the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag. I use many of these _VAR_..._ type of comments </p>  in the page and I use them as &quot;display&quot; variables. These are searched </p>  and replaced at runtime. For example my ASP page replaces the <code>&lt;!--_VAR_TITLE_--&gt;</code> </p>  tag with the page title and the <code>&lt;!--_VAR_CONTENT_1_--&gt; </code> with </p>  the meat of the content at the time of script execution.</p></p><h3>Blowin' it up</h3></p><p>I have been using windows scripting to automate a lot of stuff on my PC, which </p>  means I use it again to make a script that would break up the HTML. I make </p>  use of the powerful JavaScript regexp object to do this. I execute the script </p>  on the layout HTML file in which I have also inserted  my special comments. The <strong>cscript.exe</strong> </p>  interpreter that comes installed with windows takes care of interpreting and executing the</p>JavaScript. </p>  I find windows scripting quite useful when I install ActivePython/Perl. I can even use</p>Python or Perl scripts in it.</p></p><p>I execute my script on the HTML file using a command line syntax similar to </p>  this:</p></p><p><code>d:\files&gt;cscript tools.wsf //job:SplitHtml file.html input_folder</code></p></p><p>Incidentally the .wsf script file is called a package file and can contain </p>  scripts for multiple tasks (or &lt;job&gt; as Microsoft documentation calls it), </p>  so the <strong>SplitHtml</strong> is a job in the wsf file. The SplitHtml job executes on the </p>  html file and creates multiple text files. The text files are named using the </p>  tag we defined the section to be e.g.:<br></p>  For a section that was marked as: <br></p>  <code>&lt;!--[_part_start_:<strong>000.01.head_beg</strong>]--&gt;</code> <br> the HTML code in </p>  the section denoted by this comment tag gets extracted to a file called <strong>000.01.head_beg.txt</strong>.</p></p><p>The SplitHtml script uses regular expression matching to extract the specific </p>  _part_start_ sections of the HTML page. The regular expression was defined in </p>  Javascript as:<br></p>  <br></p>  <code><strong>re=new RegExp(&quot;\&lt;\!--\\[_part_start_:([0-9]{3}.[0-9]{2}.[A-Za-z_]+)\\]--\&gt;&quot;,&quot;g&quot;);</strong></code> </p></p></p><p>The script creates  files for every such designated section.</p></p><p><img src="images/20519/23170/output_files.gif" width="238" height="372" border="0" alt="image of explorer File Listing" /></p></p><p>I  used a naming scheme for the comment tags, which ensures that the generated </p>  text files maintain the same <strong>sequence</strong> as the section dividing comments. Additionally  </p>  the naming scheme allows me to add a new section comment without changing or </p>  disrupting the existing sequence. For instance if I needed to add some new HTML </p>  code between <strong>000.02.head_scr</strong> and <strong>000.99.head_end</strong> </p>  (head_end marks the <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag..) sections, I can insert up to</p>95 individual </p>  parts in between by naming them as 000.03.tag1, 000.04.tag2.....When I sort </p>  the files in Windows Explorer by name, they are in exactly the same sequence </p>  as the _part_start_ comments were in the originating HTML file. </p></p><p>Maybe a better method of maintaining the sequence, would be to store the individual </p>  splits in a database table. Well, this works for me so I use it.</p></p><p>My ASP page scripts read the split parts sequentially (discussed later below) </p>  and renders the page. </p></p><p>When I want to see the page as a single HTML file, I again use a windows script </p>  called BuildHtml that rebuilds the HTML file from the parts text files. This </p>  job uses a very similar syntax to the SplitHtml method. I can also now use any HTML editor to edit the page layout.</p></p><p>All the source code for SplitHtml &amp; BuildHtml with a couple of other script </p>  functions to query display tags &amp; variable tags in a HTML file can be downloaded </p>  from: <br> <a title="Download source code for this article as a zip file" href="files/20519/23170/source.zip">source.zip</a></p></p><h2>Fusion</h2></p><p>We use some ASP fusion to create our dynamically generated page out of all </p>  the pieces we divided our HTML page into. Let's start with the basics. If my </p>  ASP page is called <strong>display.asp, </strong> I have a corresponding <strong> </p>  definition file</strong> for it called <strong>def.display.asp </strong>. </p></p><h3>Defining The Ingredients </h3></p><p>The definition file defines the sequence in which the individual HTML section </p>  files (the text files we just created) should be looked up &amp; allows defining </p>  of a condition for looking up the section. This file is included at the beginning </p>  of every ASP file it defines the structure. For instance when display.asp </p>  is executed, the def.display.asp is first executed and a String variable is </p>  built which contains the HTML code for the page.</p></p><p>The def.display.asp file would look something like this:</p></p>  <pre></p>  &lt;%</p>/**************************</p>Section 1 -- HTML Lookups </p>***************************/</p>/*now we being lookup the html sections */</p>/*this should always be shown..*/</p>/*Settings for this page*/</p>/*</p>  Header section</p>  */</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;000.01.head_beg&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;000.02.head_scr&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;000.99.head_end&quot;,true);</p>  /*</p>  Banner section</p>  */</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;001.00.body&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;001.01.banner&quot;,printable());</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;001.02.horiz_nav&quot;,printable());</p>  /*</p>  Page Vertical Navigation</p>  */</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;002.01.main_tbl_begin&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;002.02.vertical_nav_beg&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;002.03.vertical_nav&quot;,printable());</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;002.04.vertical_nav_end&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;002.05.content_begin&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;002.08.content_end&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;002.09.main_tbl_end&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;003.01.footer&quot;,true);</p>  HtmlLookup(&quot;009.99.end_page&quot;,true);</p>%&gt;</p></pre></p><p>The HtmlLookup function takes the section name as the 1st parameter (this happens </p>  to be the primary name for the text file) and a 2nd parameter which can be used </p>  to conditionally display the section. For instance, in the sample with this </p>  article I hide a part of the navigation when the page is being viewed in printable </p>  mode (I set a page to printable mode by passing a query string parameter).<br></p>  The multiple calls to HTMLLookup builds a string variable with the HTML code </p>  for the page. Based on the section name that has been passed the lookup function </p>  opens the corresponding .txt file and builds up the HTML.</p></p>  </p><h3>Concocting the page for the final output</h3></p><p>Now to the structure of our main ASP file display.asp . This page has a few </p>  SSI includes, and importantly this is where our main code to pick up the content </p>  from a database would reside. The specific content is then updated into the </p>  specific comment _VAR_iables I described earlier. I have a helper function called </p>  <b>HtmlTransform </b>which takes the _VAR_ variable name as the 1st parameter </p>  and the actual content to be displayed in place of that variable as a string </p>  parameter. </p></p><p>In the HtmlTransform function I search and replace every instance of the comment </p>  variable with the content string. Which means that I could have _VAR_TITLE_ </p>  or any other display tage appearing more than once. My search &amp; replace </p>  function would appear as:</p></p><p><strong><code> replace(strHtml, &quot;\&lt;\!--&quot;+strVariable+&quot;--\&gt;&quot;, </p>  strReplace) ;</code></strong></p></p><p>where strVariable is anything like (_VAR_TITLE_, _VAR_CONTENT_1_ etc.), (the </p>  replace function is some code taken from one of the gazillion javascript sites...)</p></p><p>There is an additional advantage to using a _VAR_ style of variable. For instance </p>  if my vertical navigation menu bar (typically on the left or hand side of a </p>  page) is not to appear on the print version or a hidden navigation version of </p>  the page, I can save the overhead of a lookup to the database for that information </p>  (This would be relevant if the menu navigation or any of the display element </p>  which is to be hidden in a print version is picked up from a database), by simply </p>  checking if the _VAR_ variable for the menu exists in my HTML string. Something </p>  like:</p></p><pre>if (getHtml().indexOf(&quot;&lt;!--_VAR_LEFTMENU_--&gt;&quot;) != -1)</p> //only if the HTML string contains a leftmenu display </p> //variable pickup the content for it</p>{</p> strVertMenuOut = LookupFromDatabase();</p> }</p></pre></p><p>So my display.asp script would look something like this:</p></p><pre></p>&lt;%@ LANGUAGE=JScript%&gt;</p>&lt;!--common ssis--&gt;</p>&lt;!--#include file=&quot;inc/globvars.asp&quot;--&gt;</p>&lt;!--#include file=&quot;inc/funcs.asp&quot;--&gt;</p>&lt;!--#include file=&quot;inc/setprintable.asp&quot;--&gt;</p>&lt;!--end common includes--&gt;</p>&lt;!--page defintion ssi--&gt;</p>&lt;!--#include file=&quot;def.display.asp&quot;--&gt;</p>&lt;%</p>  /*</p>  Section 2 -- HTML Transforms </p>  */</p>  //Code to fetch content from database</p>  //Code to fetch stuff like page title etc. </p>  var strContent1;</p>  var strContent2;</p>  //here we just fill with dummy info</p>  strContent1 = &quot;&lt;h2&gt;My Content1&lt;/h2&gt;&quot;;</p>  strContent2 = &quot;&lt;h2&gt;My Content2&lt;/h2&gt;&quot;;</p>  //Code to fetch Navigation menus etc.</p>  //.....</p>  //again I fill up some dummy links for my vertical menu</p>  strVertNav = &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://dir.evolt.org\&quot;&gt; </p>  Evolt directory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://browsers.evolt.org\&quot;&gt;Evolt </p>  Browsers&lt;/a&gt;&quot;;</p>  //....</p>  //.....</p><p>  //begin transforms</p>  HtmlTransform(&quot;_VAR_TITLE_&quot;, &quot;HTML Templating sample code&quot;);</p>  HtmlTransform(&quot;_VAR_CONTENT_1_&quot;, strContent1);</p>  HtmlTransform(&quot;_VAR_CONTENT_2_&quot;, strContent2);</p>  HtmlTransform(&quot;_VAR_VERT_NAV_&quot;, strVertNav);</p>%&gt;</p>  &lt;!--output page html here--&gt;</p>  &lt;%=getHtml()%&gt;</p>&lt;!--page end--&gt;</p></pre></p><p><h2>Main advantages of this method</h2></p><ul></p>  <li>Separation of HTML from ASP code</li></p><li>Splitting of page HTML increases flexibility & makes changes easier</li></p>  <li>Makes creation of print versions, alternate navigations easier </li></p>    </p>  <li> Easy to adapt to other non-asp languages (hopefully!)&nbsp; </li></p></ul></p><p><h2>Some drawbacks of this method</h2></p><ul></p>  <li>The method is very much dependent on a proper sequential naming scheme for </p>    named _part_ comments (I maintain a sequential documented list of _part_ and _VAR_ comments </p>    in an excel sheet  just for my reference)</li></p>  <li>Additional Scripts like SplitHtml &amp; BuildHtml need to be used to view </p>    the HTML file as a whole when required (and this is dependent on a proper </p>    naming scheme)</li> </p><li>There might be a higher performance overhead since all the HTML is looked up and filled in a string and then the named comments replaced </li></p></ul></p><p><h2>Sample code</h2></p><p> All the sample ASP &amp; WSF script code with sample files can downloaded </p>  from:<br></p>  <a title="Download sample code as zip file" href="files/20519/23170/source.zip">source.zip</a> </p></p></p><p></p><h2>Related links</h2></p><p> I found some similar methods &amp; ideas discussed at:<br></p>  <a title="Launches new window" href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com" target=_blank>4guysfromrolla</a> </p>  <br></p>  These are a couple of sites on Windows Scripting that I have found useful:<br></p>  <a title="Launches new window" href="http://www.winscripter.com/" target=_blank>WinScripter.com</a><br></p>  <a title="Launches new window" href="http://communities.msn.com/windowsscript" target=_blank>Ian Morrish's site on Windows scripting</a><br></p>  Just as I was posting this article, I saw this nice article on regex by sprocket:<br></p>  <a title="Links to regex article by sprocket on evolt.org" href="/article/Regular_Expression_Basics/20/22700/index.html">Regular Expression basics</a></p>  </p>
