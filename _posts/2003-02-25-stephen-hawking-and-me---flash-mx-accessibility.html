<p>I recently spent a day learning how to make <a href="http://macromedia.com/macromedia/accessibility/" target="_blank">Flash </p>  accessible</a>. That included downloading a screen reader called <a href="http://www.gwmicro.com/" target="_blank">Window-Eyes </p>  </a>(from GW Micro, Inc.) and freaking myself out with it for a while. The reader </p>  voice was similar to that of <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/">Stephen Hawking </p>  </a>(who has his own accessible site). Yes, the Stephen Hawking <a href="http://www.yesterdayland.com/popopedia/shows/toys/ty1074.php" target="_blank">Speak </p>  and Spell</a> voice. It was like having him here with me narrating my website. </p>  I chose to code and test Flash accessibility on my <a href="http://texturadesign.net/" target="_blank">freelance </p>  site</a>, because it was new and not a large site (Note: Since I wrote this </p>  article, I've also published accessible flash sites for clients). If you follow </p>  the tips below, making Flash accessible is not a big chore.</p></p><p><p>During the coding, I discovered, &#8220;what they don't tell you.&#8221; Macromedia support </p>  and GW Micro were very helpful and confirmed that I had found a &#8220;known issue.&#8221; </p>  There is no onmouseover vocal state for Flash movie buttons. The Flash player </p>  only provides a tab vocal state. That make sense when you realize that blind </p>  users don't use a mouse, but it's quite disconcerting to test the site, onmouseover </p>  a button, and have Stephen Hawking say, &#8220;graphic,&#8221; for every button. When you </p>  load the page and tab through it, the text reader properly identifies the Flash </p>  movie, button and the link. If you use the mouse, as I had expected some visually </p>  impaired users might do, it makes no sense at all. Most of my day was spent </p>  trying to figure out what I had coded wrong. I tried every possible accessibility </p>  element/variable combination in Flash. Many developers might just trust Macromedia's </p>  software and have no idea how it works with voice readers. This can be a terrible </p>  mistake and render your site useless to the visually impaired user.</p></p><p><p>I was successful and my site is Flash accessible. Thinking of how your site</p>flows is one thing. Doing it with your eyes closed and only using tab,</p>tab+shift, and enter is completely different. Stephen Hawking and I</p>navigated through the whole site. Making Flash accessible isn't difficult;</p>developers should not just trust Flash MX to do it for you. While Flash MX</p>does produce accessible results from default, there are few tips you need to</p>know to make it work.</p></p><p><ol></p>  <li> <strong>Read <a href="http://www.joeclark.org" target="_blank">Joe Clark</a>.</strong><br>Clark's </p>    ALA articles and website are very informative. Macromedia's design guidelines </p>    are also helpful, but can be confusing. You just don't know a voice reader </p>    works, until you test it yourself. At this time, Flash is only <a href="http://macromedia.com/macromedia/accessibility/features/flash/" target="_blank">accessible </p>    in Player version 6</a> with Window-Eyes 4.2, using Windows Internet Explorer </p>    6.</li></p>  <li><strong>Listen to your site.</strong><br> It's very helpful to download the demo version of the </p>    Windows-Eyes screen reader. This is important because, according to Window-Eyes, </p>    a visually impaired user uses the keyboard 90% of the time. While you can </p>    tab through all sorts of tasks without their software, the screen reader allows </p>    you to hear the user experience. You'll be surprised at what you hear. Note </p>    that the demo will time out after 30 minutes, but you can reboot it an unlimited </p>    number of times. It is also not modal, meaning you cannot toggle the demo </p>    on and off. It runs at startup for 30 minutes and that's it. However, you </p>    do get a good test method without purchasing the software. If you download </p>    the demo version of Window-Eyes, try Microsoft's Text-To-Speech Robot #1. </p>    It's the voice of the Cylon Centurions from <a href="http://www.battlestargalactica.com/" target="_blank">Battlestar </p>    Galactica</a>. </li></p>  <li><strong>Tab through your movie.</strong><br> Even without using Windows-Eyes, you can tab through </p>    your Flash movie. Click on the movie, tab through the buttons, and hit enter </p>    to go to a link. The Flash player will yellow-highlight the buttons as you </p>    tab through them. Remember mousing through the movie won't work with the Flash </p>    player and Window-Eyes and this is not how most visually impaired users will </p>    access your site.</li></p>  <li><strong>Label with care.</strong><br> I read through Macromedia's design guidelines, but still </p>    wasn't sure how it worked. I tried and listened to several label variations. </p>    What worked was to choose, &#8220;Make Movie Object Accessible &gt; Make Child </p>    Objects Accessible &gt; Autolabel,&#8221; in the Accessibility palette. I </p>    then named the movie, &#8220;Flash navigation,&#8221; and did not name the </p>    buttons. By default, Window-Eyes will read the text buttons. As I discovered, </p>    adding a name and description to the button is not helpful, instead it's very </p>    annoying, &#8220;Button, about,&#8221; is clearer then, &#8220;Button, About, </p>    Link to about page, about page is about this site.&#8221; On my site, when </p>    Flash loads, Windows-Eyes alerts the user that Flash is present and reads, </p>    &#8220;Flash navigation, Button: About, Button: news,&#8221; and continues </p>    through the rest of the navigation.</li></p>  <li><strong>Don't stop at Flash.</strong><br> Flash MX does make it easier for the developer, but </p>    don't forget other accessibility considerations. Check Christopher Schmitt's </p>    ALA article on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/tools/" target="_blank">Accessibility </p>    and Authoring</a> tools and<a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/" target="_blank"> </p>    Dive Into Accessibility</a>. Besides the Flash, listen to how the rest of </p>    your site sounds. Or, at least, try tabbing through it.</li></p></ol></p><p>As I learned, with the help of Stephen Hawking's voice making Flash</p>accessible is not difficult. Flash MX makes it easier, as long as you know</p>how Flash player 6, Window-Eyes, and IE 6 work together.</p>
