<p>I had read many impressive comments about the trio of books of Professor Edward \n  R. Tufte. All of them were extremely favorable, yet vague. This made my curiosity \n  about these books grow day after day.</p>\n    <p>When I finally bought "<a \nhref="http://www.edwardtufte.com/1293727238/tufte/books_ei" target="blank" tilte="Book description in Tufte's website, opens in new window">Envisioning \n  Information</a>," and opened the book I was impressed. From the quality of the paper and print to the contents themselves \n  and the way they are arranged on the page, this book is beautiful. Every little detail has been carefully \n  studied. Professor Tufte had such high demands for the production of the books \n  that he had to build his own <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/" target="_blank" title="Grapics Press, opens in new window">editorial</a>.</p></p><p><table align="left" width="200" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" class="border" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px">\n      <tr valign="top">\n        <td class="side" align="left">\n      <p><a href="images/138/36074/tufte_signals_big.gif" target="_blank" title="link opens in a new window"><img src="images/138/36074/tufte_signals_small.gif" width="200" height="253" border="0"> \n        Sample page (105k)</a></p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<p>Most of the pages or twofolds can be read as a single unit (or case study), \n  which display an amazing synergy between text and diagrams, with notes like \n  "in the image to the left is an example of..." that produces a very strong sensation \n  of the narrative. Once immersed in the reading you feel like Prof. Tufte were \n  there, explaining his points personally to you. Each illustration has been reproduced \n  with such care to detail that they show the qualities of the original print. \n  This was achieved by several special ink colors in the production. For instance, \n  the old drawings of Galileo Galilei are framed by a subtle cream color, which \n  make them stand out from the rest of the page, achieving the effect of aged \n  paper. The contents of the explanations are irrefutable, each explanation is \n  very clear and precise, the evidence evident.</p>\n<p>The central problem of this study is presented in the first paragraph of the \n  introduction:</p>\n<blockquote>The world is complex, dynamic, multidimensional; the paper is static, flat.\nHow are we to represent the rich visual world of experience and measurement on mere flatland?</blockquote></p><p><table align="right" width="150" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" class="border" style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px">\n      <tr valign="top">\n        <td class="side" align="left">\n      <p><strong>Contents:</strong></p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Escaping Flatland \n        <li>Micro/Macro Readings \n        <li>Layering and Separation \n        <li>Small Multiples \n        <li>Color and Information \n        <li>Narratives of Space and Time \n        <li>Epilogue </li>\n      </ul>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<p>This book explores the best uses for the presentation of multi-dimensional \n  phenomena into the two dimensions of paper, <em>flatland</em> , it does so with \n  such passion and clarity, that once you reach the middle of the book, you start \n  wishing for it to grow longer as each page passes.</p>\n<p>Envisioning Information presents years of history of all kinds of maps, timetables, \n  multi-dimensional graphs and instructions. Covering topics that include Geometry, Medicine, \n  Dance, Astronomy, Geography, Human Transportation. One of the longest examples \n  presentsan evolution of the presentation of solar spot observations, from Galileo's \n  sketches to computer generated graphs. Although at first sight, this book is \n  not directly related to web development, the knowledge presented can be applied \n  to any discipline. Every professional activity is faced with the task of presenting \n  measurements, comparations, observations, conceptual designs or visual designs: \n  Envisioning Information can help anyone deliver better documents and make his \n  message clear, regardless of his or her field of work. As described in the book:</p>\n<blockquote>The principles of information design are universal - like mathematics - and \n  are not tied to unique features of a particlar language or culture. Consequently, \n  our examples are widely distributed in space and time: illustrations come from \n  17 countries and 7 centuries, and, for that matter, 3 planets and one star.\n</blockquote>\n<p>This book is a real treasure. I highly recommend it.</p></p><p><table align="center" width="90%" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" class="border">\n      <tr valign="top">\n        <td class="side" align="center" colspan="2">\n      <div align="center"><strong>The Tufte trio</strong>, as described in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com" target="_blank" title="Tufte's website, opens in new window">Tufte \n        website</a></div>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392142/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20" target="_blank" title="buy The Visual Display of Quantitative Information at Amazon"><img src="images/138/36074/vdqi_small.jpg" width="91" height="115" border="0"></a></td>\n    <td>\n      <p><strong>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</strong></p>\n      <p>The classic book on statistical graphics, charts, tables.</p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392118/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20" target="_blank" title="buy Envisioning Information at Amazon"><img src="images/138/36074/ei_small.gif" width="86" height="110" border="0"></a></td>\n    <td>\n      <p><strong>Envisioning Information</strong></p>\n      <p>This book celebrates escapes from the flatlands of both paper and computer \n        screen, showing superb displays of high-dimensional complex data. </p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392126/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20" target="_blank" title="buy Visual Explanations at Amazon"><img src="images/138/36074/visex_small.jpg" width="89" height="110" border="0"></a></td>\n    <td><strong>Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative</strong> \n      is about pictures of verbs, the representation of mechanism and motion, \n      process and dynamics, causes and effects, explanation and narrative. </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>
