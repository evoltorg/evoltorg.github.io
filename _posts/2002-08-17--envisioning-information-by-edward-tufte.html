excerpt: "The central problem of this study is presented in the first paragraph of the   introduction:</p>The world is complex, dynamic, multidimensional; the paper is static, flat.</p>How are we to represent the rich visual world of experience and measurement on mere flatland?"

<p>I had read many impressive comments about the trio of books of Professor Edward </p>  R. Tufte. All of them were extremely favorable, yet vague. This made my curiosity </p>  about these books grow day after day.</p></p>    <p>When I finally bought "<a </p>href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/1293727238/tufte/books_ei" target="blank" tilte="Book description in Tufte's website, opens in new window">Envisioning </p>  Information</a>," and opened the book I was impressed. From the quality of the paper and print to the contents themselves </p>  and the way they are arranged on the page, this book is beautiful. Every little detail has been carefully </p>  studied. Professor Tufte had such high demands for the production of the books </p>  that he had to build his own <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/" target="_blank" title="Grapics Press, opens in new window">editorial</a>.</p></p><p><table align="left" width="200" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" class="border" style="margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px"></p>      <tr valign="top"></p>        <td class="side" align="left"></p>      <p><a href="images/138/36074/tufte_signals_big.gif" target="_blank" title="link opens in a new window"><img src="images/138/36074/tufte_signals_small.gif" width="200" height="253" border="0"> </p>        Sample page (105k)</a></p></p>    </td></p>  </tr></p></table></p><p>Most of the pages or twofolds can be read as a single unit (or case study), </p>  which display an amazing synergy between text and diagrams, with notes like </p>  "in the image to the left is an example of..." that produces a very strong sensation </p>  of the narrative. Once immersed in the reading you feel like Prof. Tufte were </p>  there, explaining his points personally to you. Each illustration has been reproduced </p>  with such care to detail that they show the qualities of the original print. </p>  This was achieved by several special ink colors in the production. For instance, </p>  the old drawings of Galileo Galilei are framed by a subtle cream color, which </p>  make them stand out from the rest of the page, achieving the effect of aged </p>  paper. The contents of the explanations are irrefutable, each explanation is </p>  very clear and precise, the evidence evident.</p></p><p>The central problem of this study is presented in the first paragraph of the </p>  introduction:</p></p><blockquote>The world is complex, dynamic, multidimensional; the paper is static, flat.</p>How are we to represent the rich visual world of experience and measurement on mere flatland?</blockquote></p><p><table align="right" width="150" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" class="border" style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px"></p>      <tr valign="top"></p>        <td class="side" align="left"></p>      <p><strong>Contents:</strong></p></p>      <ul></p>        <li>Escaping Flatland </p>        <li>Micro/Macro Readings </p>        <li>Layering and Separation </p>        <li>Small Multiples </p>        <li>Color and Information </p>        <li>Narratives of Space and Time </p>        <li>Epilogue </li></p>      </ul></p>    </td></p>  </tr></p></table></p><p>This book explores the best uses for the presentation of multi-dimensional </p>  phenomena into the two dimensions of paper, <em>flatland</em> , it does so with </p>  such passion and clarity, that once you reach the middle of the book, you start </p>  wishing for it to grow longer as each page passes.</p></p><p>Envisioning Information presents years of history of all kinds of maps, timetables, </p>  multi-dimensional graphs and instructions. Covering topics that include Geometry, Medicine, </p>  Dance, Astronomy, Geography, Human Transportation. One of the longest examples </p>  presentsan evolution of the presentation of solar spot observations, from Galileo's </p>  sketches to computer generated graphs. Although at first sight, this book is </p>  not directly related to web development, the knowledge presented can be applied </p>  to any discipline. Every professional activity is faced with the task of presenting </p>  measurements, comparations, observations, conceptual designs or visual designs: </p>  Envisioning Information can help anyone deliver better documents and make his </p>  message clear, regardless of his or her field of work. As described in the book:</p></p><blockquote>The principles of information design are universal - like mathematics - and </p>  are not tied to unique features of a particlar language or culture. Consequently, </p>  our examples are widely distributed in space and time: illustrations come from </p>  17 countries and 7 centuries, and, for that matter, 3 planets and one star.</p></blockquote></p><p>This book is a real treasure. I highly recommend it.</p></p><p><table align="center" width="90%" border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" class="border"></p>      <tr valign="top"></p>        <td class="side" align="center" colspan="2"></p>      <div align="center"><strong>The Tufte trio</strong>, as described in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com" target="_blank" title="Tufte's website, opens in new window">Tufte </p>        website</a></div></p>    </td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392142/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20" target="_blank" title="buy The Visual Display of Quantitative Information at Amazon"><img src="images/138/36074/vdqi_small.jpg" width="91" height="115" border="0"></a></td></p>    <td></p>      <p><strong>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</strong></p></p>      <p>The classic book on statistical graphics, charts, tables.</p></p>    </td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392118/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20" target="_blank" title="buy Envisioning Information at Amazon"><img src="images/138/36074/ei_small.gif" width="86" height="110" border="0"></a></td></p>    <td></p>      <p><strong>Envisioning Information</strong></p></p>      <p>This book celebrates escapes from the flatlands of both paper and computer </p>        screen, showing superb displays of high-dimensional complex data. </p></p>    </td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392126/ref=nosim/evoltorg02-20" target="_blank" title="buy Visual Explanations at Amazon"><img src="images/138/36074/visex_small.jpg" width="89" height="110" border="0"></a></td></p>    <td><strong>Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative</strong> </p>      is about pictures of verbs, the representation of mechanism and motion, </p>      process and dynamics, causes and effects, explanation and narrative. </td></p>  </tr></p></table>
