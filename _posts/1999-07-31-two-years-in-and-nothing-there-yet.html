It seems like yesterday that we formed our illustrious team, but as we wander into the first week of August evolt.org has dedicated a collective 1.97 years of computing power to the SETI@home project.</p><p><a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@home</a> is a scientific experiment that harnesses the power of hundreds of thousands of</p>Internet-connected computers in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). </p><p>With <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cgi?cmd=team_lookup&name=evolt.org">20 members strong</a> (18 if you discount the two inactive members) the evolt.org team has managed to trawl the radio telescope data for a total of 487 packets and 17257 hours 13 minutes and 52.2 seconds.  That's a lot of screen saver time.</p><p>The fatest computer belongs to Travis Truman as he pounds out new results on an average of 12 hours and 55 minutes.  Congrats Travis.</p><p>If you want to join our amazing team of sky gazers click <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cgi?cmd=team_lookup&name=evolt.org">here</a>.
