<P>Everyone knows the latest and greatest buzz on the Web is about <a href="http://www.whatis.com/xml.htm">XML</a> these days. Now that everyone is aware of the benefits XML provides, where do you go from there?</P>\n<P>\nThe <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/xml/index2.html">XML Journal</a> has a good <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/java/xml/boyd/index.html">article this month</a> that gives some basic information on how to tie the power of XML into your <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> database. A nice read if you're interested in knowing more about Oracle 8i's XML capabilities, and the role of XML in database's in general.\n</P>
