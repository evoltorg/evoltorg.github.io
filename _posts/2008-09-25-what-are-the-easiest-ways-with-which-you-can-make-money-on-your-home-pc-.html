There are many different ways that you can earn money on your home computer. Some methods are more dependable than others, of course, but some methods are proven and very trustworthy. Some of the money making methods require some initial hard work, but once in place only requires a few hours a week. In fact, these are the moneymaking proposition for a stay at home mom and also retired people who want to earn a steady amount  of cash.\n  Other methods may need a little more effort and time, but can prove to be lucrative. The thing that you need to remember when you are looking for a good system that will allow you to earn money on your home PC, is to avoid illegal activity.\n You do not want to get mixed up in something that is not legal or could be potentially harmful to someone. MLM income opportunities also receive a great deal of opposition. The controversy that surrounds these so called opportunities is that they only make money for the person who started it or the few people who are in the higher ranks or tiers of the system. The people under them are nothing more than worker ants that make money for the upper tiers while never seeing much for them. These three tips will help you take your business to the next level by driving traffic to your website and giving people what they want (which will keep them coming back!).\nFollow these two important and easy-to-follow tips for making sure that your bank balance increases proportionately.  \n* Tip 1 - Article Marketing. Article marketing is one of the easiest ways that you can drive traffic to your website. Write content articles that people want and include your information at the end of the article along with a link to your website. Place the article and resource information in an article directory. When another web site owner picks up your article to place on their own website, they also include your resource information - and the link to your site, which immediately makes you a part of the social network. What happens is visitors to that website are exposed to your link so they click over to your site. Another thing that happens, though, is that your link winds up on other site which increases your ranking in the search engines. You get a double win for your efforts! </p><p>* Tip 2 - Affiliate Marketing -- Affiliate marketing is another great way to earn money on your home computer. You simply sign up with a company as an affiliate. And there are thousands of companies just requesting you to become their affiliate on the Internet today.  In fact you are spoilt  for choice to choose the best company, in which you can become a member and  then market their product or website. It is that simple. Any sales that your promotion and marketing generates earn you a commission. Some people do nothing but affiliate marketing and earn a very nice income. When you sign up, the company gives you a special link. \nYou promote that link through article marketing, offering e-courses, newsletters and other promotional items. Some companies give incentives just for generating clicks to their site so you may earn income from that. Other companies offer commission on sales that you make through your own marketing efforts. This is a great way to earn money on your home PC because you don't have to stock inventory, create a product or worry about shipping. All you have to do is promote the product, whenever you can and where ever you can. \n* Tip 3 - Contextual Advertising. This is another income method that is very popular. All you have to do is place advertisements on your web page and you make money each time someone clicks through. Google AdSense was the first major contextual advertising program and today it is still one of the most popular programs going around up on the Internet today. All you have to do is sign up with Google AdSense and they will give you some HTML code to place on your website. Place it on your website and you are in business! Of course, you will need to drive traffic to your site in order to generate the click throughs, but when you are successful it can be a great way to earn money from your home computer.\n
