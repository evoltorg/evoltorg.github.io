<p>Another month gone, another stack of accomplishments by the evolt.org community. \n  As a reminder, this is open to anyone in the community, so if you missed a chance \n  to <a href="http://evolt.org/contact/index.html">toot</a> your horn, add a comment, \n  and watch for the announcement for next month's news. </p>\n<h2>Evoltspottings</h2>\n<p>All over the web, people are looking to see what evolters have to say, and \n  sometimes they point their users back to the source. Here are some of the pointers, \n  all noticed this month:</p></p><p><ul>\n  <li><a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020530.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">A \n    mention in Lockergnome</a>, which boasts 250,000+ subscribers, for the <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/">browser \n    archive</a>.</li>\n  <li>This article on <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000030.php" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">Unifying \n    the Online Presence of Decentralized Organizations</a>, by Peter Merholz, \n    points to <strong>Martin's</strong> <a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/You_need_a_Content_Management_System/20/1449/">You \n    Need a Content Management System</a>.</li>\n <li>The glasshaus book <cite>Usability: The Site Speaks for Itself</cite> hit the streets this month.  If you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904151035/ref=nosim/evoltorg" target="_new" title="Opens in new window">buy it from Amazon.com</a> with this link, evolt.org gets a nice affiliate kickback.  Another book that hit, featuring evolt.org members Shirley Kaiser and Adrian Roselli as technical editors, is the title <cite>Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation</cite>, also by glasshaus, and also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904151043/ref=nosim/evoltorg" target="_new" title="Also part of the evolt.org affiliate program; opens in new window">available at Amazon.com</a>.</li>\n</ul></p><p><p>Thanks to the many people who have taken the time to cite evolt.org in their \n  own work</p>\n<h2>We're getting organized</h2>\n<p> Behind the scenes, evolt.org members have developed five groups, plus two \n  other bodies, to help organize and run evolt.org. The five groups and their \n  purposes are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Content</strong><br>\n    Responsible, for editing and approving articles which appear on www.evolt.org, \n    responding to emails that come through the site and day-to-day management \n    of the evolt mailing lists.</li>\n  <li><strong>Development</strong><br>\n    Responsible for the design and implementation of various projects.</li>\n  <li><strong>Finance</strong><br>\n    Responsible for handling the money side of evolt.org. Fundraising efforts \n    are jointly made with...</li>\n  <li> <strong>Marketing</strong><br>\n    Responsible for building and maintaining the evolt.org brand, and for managing \n    all external relationships.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sysadmin</strong><br>\n    Responsible for administering the evolt.org servers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>Steering Committee</strong>, being organized now, will be made \n  up of two members from each of the 5 groups. Its purpose is to help set goals \n  for the groups, monitor progress, and solve disputes&#151;should they arise&#151;amongst \n  the groups.</p>\n<p><strong>TheForum</strong> is a catch-all list for general communication between \n  the different evolt.org committees, and for discussing non-committee-specific \n  issues. Anyone can <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/mailman/listinfo/theforum/">join \n  TheForum</a>, and we encourage your participation. If you have ideas for evolt.org, \n  or can contribute even a little bit of time and energy into helping us thrive, \n  we'd love to have you!</p>\n<h2>Help support evolt.org</h2>\n<p>We're now again able to accept monetary gifts through:<br>\n<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post">\n  <input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_xclick">\n  <input type="hidden" name="business" value="give@evolt.org">\n  <input type="hidden" name="item_name" value="evolt.org's shameless tin cup">\n  <input type="hidden" name="item_number" value="1">\n  <input type="image" src="https://www.paypal.com/images/x-click-but04.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="Make payments with PayPal - it's fast, free and secure!">\n</form></p>\n<p>Our address for monetary gifts or giving inquiries is <a href="mailto:give%40evolt.org">give&#064;evolt.org</a>. \n  We will soon have a snail mail address (for checks, money orders, etc.).</p>\n<p>We're looking for other on-line, commercial (in other words, <strong>not personal</strong> \n  bank account), low-cost money transferring capabilities so that non-US residents \n  may more easily help support evolt.org. <a href="mailto:give%40evolt.org">Please \n  write us</a> if you know of any good commercial services in your country. </p>\n<p>Here's more information on <a href="/help_support_evolt/index.html">how \n  to help support evolt.org</a>. Thanks for your interest! </p>\n<h2>Beervolts</h2>\n<h3>Frisbeervolt in Toronto</h3>\n<p>Thanks to a ColdFusion conference in Toronto, <a href="http://evolt.org/user/jeff/15/index.html">.jeff</a> \n  and <a href="http://evolt.org/user/nagrom/21068/index.html">nagrom</a> worked \n  their way up north to meet up with <a href="http://evolt.org/user/r937/20/index.html">r937</a>, \n  <a href="http://evolt.org/user/Mishka/4292/index.html">Mishka</a>, <a href="http://evolt.org/user/mwarden/65/index.html">mwarden</a>, \n  <a href="http://evolt.org/user/sprocket/3211/index.html">sprocket</a>, and <a href="http://evolt.org/user/aardvark/88/index.html">aardvark</a>. \n  We started off, of course, with food followed up with sneaking into the CF North \n  conference, and then a little more food. With rudy (r937) taking us on a wonderful \n  frisbee golf outing to cap the night (he won, of course), it turned out to be \n  a blast. Ideally, next time theglass floor won't fall out of the CN Tower and \n  suck us all to our death. Um, yeah, anyway, there are <a href="http://roselli.org/photos/evolt.org_visits_toronto/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window, and full of sexy photos">photos \n  of the weekend posted</a>. </p>\n<h3>Beervolt London</h3>\n<p>The London evoltistas got together again - Mike, John, Megan, Martin and special \n  non-evolt guest, <span title="Who lives with John">Emily</span>. We started \n  out aboard a ship converted to a bar, then moved on to somewhere where we could \n  get a drink in without queuing for 45 minutes. </p>\n<p>Mike had the world's smallest and cheapest digital camera and took <a href="http://m453.com/gallery/beervolt05" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">some \n  photos</a>.</p>\n<h2>Our members</h2>\n<h3>Dan Cody (djc)</h3>\n<p>The spark that started evolt.org and led contributors to the community for \n  much of its life so far has decided to discontinue his involvement in order \n  to devote more time to his interests in Linux advocacy, public speaking, and other web \n  projects. evolt.org members wish <a href="http://www.five2one.org/" target="_blank">Dan \n  Cody</a> well in his future endeavours and thank him for his awesome contribution \n  to the community.</p>\n<p>Dan's initiation of the wonderful <a href="http://members.evolt.org/">members.evolt.org</a> \n  service remains as one of his greatest contributions. Take some time to browse \n  one of the <a href="http://www.evolt.org/user/djc/5">150+ tutorials or news \n  pieces</a> Dan had published in his time with evolt.org.</p>\n<h3>Paul Cowan</h3>\n<p>Paul made a respectable showing in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, although \n  he's framed it a bit more frankly <a href="http://funkwit.com/archive/entry/?entrydate=9191" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">on \n  his personal site</a>. </p>\n<h3>Adrian Roselli (aardvark)</h3>\n<p> An interesting month all-around. The Algonquin Studios team, led by Adrian, \n  went on to an overwhelming <a href="http://www.algonquinstudios.com/article_300.html" target="_blank" title="Press release at algonquinstudios.com; opens in new window">victory \n  at the first ever Unreal Tournament Shoot-out</a>. Soon to be a biannual event, \n  competition for the next one will be tough, and his team is already marked for \n  destruction by the others. </p>\n<p>Adrian also co-wrote an article for <cite>Multilingual Computing &amp; Technology</cite> \n  magazine, titled <a href="http://algonquinstudios.com/article_306.html" target="_blank" title="Abstract and link to PDF of article; opens in new window">A \n  Merger of Content Management and Localization Workflow</a>, detailing the merger \n  with a localization firm and integrating a localization workflow into their \n  <a href="http://quantumcms.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">QuantumCMS</a> \n  content management system. </p>\n<h3>Cayley Vos</h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.evolt.org/user/cvos/2118/index.html">Cayley</a> is proud \n  to announce a redesign of <a href="http://www.Workskiff.com/"  target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">workskiff.com</a> \n  to improve navigation, improve brand recognition, and increase search engine \n  traffic. The government is a significant client, so the design had to follow \n  accepted standard usability features. You can compare the redesign with the \n  <a href="http://www.Workskiff.com/old/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">original \n  site</a>. \n<h2>Submissions</h2>\n<p>The evolt.org Monthly Recap is a summary of awards, meetings, and fresh opportunities \n  relevant to all of us. Submitted items from month to month may be of varying \n  relevance to others depending on the number of opportunities.
