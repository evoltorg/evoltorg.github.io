<p>Another month gone, another stack of accomplishments by the evolt.org community. </p>  As a reminder, this is open to anyone in the community, so if you missed a chance </p>  to <a href="http://evolt.org/contact/index.html">toot</a> your horn, add a comment, </p>  and watch for the announcement for next month's news. </p></p><h2>Evoltspottings</h2></p><p>All over the web, people are looking to see what evolters have to say, and </p>  sometimes they point their users back to the source. Here are some of the pointers, </p>  all noticed this month:</p></p><p><ul></p>  <li><a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020530.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">A </p>    mention in Lockergnome</a>, which boasts 250,000+ subscribers, for the <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/">browser </p>    archive</a>.</li></p>  <li>This article on <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000030.php" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">Unifying </p>    the Online Presence of Decentralized Organizations</a>, by Peter Merholz, </p>    points to <strong>Martin's</strong> <a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/You_need_a_Content_Management_System/20/1449/">You </p>    Need a Content Management System</a>.</li></p> <li>The glasshaus book <cite>Usability: The Site Speaks for Itself</cite> hit the streets this month.  If you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904151035/ref=nosim/evoltorg" target="_new" title="Opens in new window">buy it from Amazon.com</a> with this link, evolt.org gets a nice affiliate kickback.  Another book that hit, featuring evolt.org members Shirley Kaiser and Adrian Roselli as technical editors, is the title <cite>Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation</cite>, also by glasshaus, and also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904151043/ref=nosim/evoltorg" target="_new" title="Also part of the evolt.org affiliate program; opens in new window">available at Amazon.com</a>.</li></p></ul></p><p><p>Thanks to the many people who have taken the time to cite evolt.org in their </p>  own work</p></p><h2>We're getting organized</h2></p><p> Behind the scenes, evolt.org members have developed five groups, plus two </p>  other bodies, to help organize and run evolt.org. The five groups and their </p>  purposes are:</p></p><ul></p>  <li><strong>Content</strong><br></p>    Responsible, for editing and approving articles which appear on www.evolt.org, </p>    responding to emails that come through the site and day-to-day management </p>    of the evolt mailing lists.</li></p>  <li><strong>Development</strong><br></p>    Responsible for the design and implementation of various projects.</li></p>  <li><strong>Finance</strong><br></p>    Responsible for handling the money side of evolt.org. Fundraising efforts </p>    are jointly made with...</li></p>  <li> <strong>Marketing</strong><br></p>    Responsible for building and maintaining the evolt.org brand, and for managing </p>    all external relationships.</li></p>  <li><strong>Sysadmin</strong><br></p>    Responsible for administering the evolt.org servers.</li></p></ul></p><p>The <strong>Steering Committee</strong>, being organized now, will be made </p>  up of two members from each of the 5 groups. Its purpose is to help set goals </p>  for the groups, monitor progress, and solve disputes&#151;should they arise&#151;amongst </p>  the groups.</p></p><p><strong>TheForum</strong> is a catch-all list for general communication between </p>  the different evolt.org committees, and for discussing non-committee-specific </p>  issues.

With rudy (r937) taking us on a wonderful </p>  frisbee golf outing to cap the night (he won, of course), it turned out to be </p>  a blast. Ideally, next time theglass floor won't fall out of the CN Tower and </p>  suck us all to our death. Um, yeah, anyway, there are <a href="http://roselli.org/photos/evolt.org_visits_toronto/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window, and full of sexy photos">photos </p>  of the weekend posted</a>. </p></p><h3>Beervolt London</h3></p><p>The London evoltistas got together again - Mike, John, Megan, Martin and special </p>  non-evolt guest, <span title="Who lives with John">Emily</span>. We started </p>  out aboard a ship converted to a bar, then moved on to somewhere where we could </p>  get a drink in without queuing for 45 minutes. </p></p><p>Mike had the world's smallest and cheapest digital camera and took <a href="http://m453.com/gallery/beervolt05" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">some </p>  photos</a>.</p></p><h2>Our members</h2></p><h3>Dan Cody (djc)</h3></p><p>The spark that started evolt.org and led contributors to the community for </p>  much of its life so far has decided to discontinue his involvement in order </p>  to devote more time to his interests in Linux advocacy, public speaking, and other web </p>  projects. evolt.org members wish <a href="http://www.five2one.org/" target="_blank">Dan </p>  Cody</a> well in his future endeavours and thank him for his awesome contribution </p>  to the community.</p></p><p>Dan's initiation of the wonderful <a href="http://members.evolt.org/">members.evolt.org</a> </p>  service remains as one of his greatest contributions. Take some time to browse </p>  one of the <a href="http://www.evolt.org/user/djc/5">150+ tutorials or news </p>  pieces</a> Dan had published in his time with evolt.org.</p></p><h3>Paul Cowan</h3></p><p>Paul made a respectable showing in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, although </p>  he's framed it a bit more frankly <a href="http://funkwit.com/archive/entry/?entrydate=9191" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">on </p>  his personal site</a>. </p></p><h3>Adrian Roselli (aardvark)</h3></p><p> An interesting month all-around. The Algonquin Studios team, led by Adrian, </p>  went on to an overwhelming <a href="http://www.algonquinstudios.com/article_300.html" target="_blank" title="Press release at algonquinstudios.com; opens in new window">victory </p>  at the first ever Unreal Tournament Shoot-out</a>. Soon to be a biannual event, </p>  competition for the next one will be tough, and his team is already marked for </p>  destruction by the others. </p></p><p>Adrian also co-wrote an article for <cite>Multilingual Computing &amp; Technology</cite> </p>  magazine, titled <a href="http://algonquinstudios.com/article_306.html" target="_blank" title="Abstract and link to PDF of article; opens in new window">A </p>  Merger of Content Management and Localization Workflow</a>, detailing the merger </p>  with a localization firm and integrating a localization workflow into their </p>  <a href="http://quantumcms.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">QuantumCMS</a> </p>  content management system. </p></p><h3>Cayley Vos</h3></p><p><a href="http://www.evolt.org/user/cvos/2118/index.html">Cayley</a> is proud </p>  to announce a redesign of <a href="http://www.Workskiff.com/"  target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">workskiff.com</a> </p>  to improve navigation, improve brand recognition, and increase search engine </p>  traffic. The government is a significant client, so the design had to follow </p>  accepted standard usability features.
