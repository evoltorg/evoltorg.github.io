The state plays a very important role in international political economy and is considered as the ultimate decision maker in both economic and political decisions. International Political Economy (IPE) is about the interaction between state and market. In contemporary age of globalization, states (with special reference to powerful states) are the main players in IPE. There are many institutional arrangements like International Monitory Fund (IMF), World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO), and certain other global, regional, and bilateral organizations in IR serving as platforms for states to come together and work for the smooth functioning of IPE. “Foreign Aid” from the Developed Countries (DCs) like the United States of America (USA) flowing to the Less Developed Countries (LDCs) like Pakistan has a significant importance in IPE. Ostensibly, this foreign aid serves the economic purpose of development and rescuing withered economy of the recipient country; but many political purposes have been witnessed in IR behind foreign aid which is inseparable from these economic initiatives of DCs.  Same is the case with the economic and political relations between India and Pakistan. To scrutinize and better understand this relationship of a powerful state from the North core (the US) with the LDC from the peripheral South (Pakistan), an overview of their historical relations is presented. This will lend us with better understanding of political incentives associated with United States Aid (USAID). The relations between the two states are studied in the ‘realist’ perspective. The Dependency Theory has also been borrowed to understand these relations. The reason for choosing this specific topic is that it presents one of the best examples of political incentives of states strongly associated with their economic policies especially lending aid to LDCs- that is, “USAID to Pakistan” to achieve the political purposes. </p><p>The Importance of Political-Economic interactions in IR</p><p>In international politics, state is the main actor which plays a very crucial role in IPE. One can argue that in the current era of globalization with many global institutions and arrangements like WTO, IMF, regional arrangements like European Union (EU), multinational corporations (MNCs) like Nokia, Gazpom, General Motors (GM), internet, media, pressure groups etc. have diminished the state power. But, state still play a very important role in political and economic spheres of IR as states are the final decision makers in International Organizations (IO), being their members and decision makers. It should be noted that DCs are the major shareholders, hence exert considerable influence in major decisions of International Financial Institutions (IFIs). Anderson et. al argue that the US political interests do often undermine the said purposes of foreign loans and aid allocation policies of IFIs like the World Bank in general. Their said purposes of poverty alleviation and development are often been compromised in front of the US interests.  As for instance, there are unequivocal instances of World Bank lending decisions where it lends loan to Pakistan, influenced by the US political interests. World Bank Official Development Assistance to Pakistan tripled from $226 million in 2001 to $860 million in 2002, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on US soil and its military engagement in Afghanistan.  The reason behind this assistance is that Pakistan has been identified as ‘frontline state’ by the Bush Administration in the ‘Global War on Terror’ (GWOT) and is neighboring state of Afghanistan. </p><p>Hence, we witness that states have foreign policies about both security and economics. But it is evident that the tangible powers of states are very much dependent upon the intangible powers like economical leverage. At the domestic level, states make policies for the protection of private property rights and the provision of infrastructure like communications and transportation which regulates market interactions effectively. While states make foreign policies and make IFIs and International Organizations (IOs) to pursue and protect their interests abroad. Therefore, Cohn H. Theodore (2008) contends that “a state’s wealth and market size are often closely related to its military and political power.”  In IPE, DCs compete with each other for international influence and furtherance of their interests, hence exploit LDCs through carrots and sticks; and foreign aid is one important strategy. </p><p>An Overview of US-Pakistan Relations Backed by the US political Incentives</p><p>Baylis, John., Smith, Steve., and Ovens, Patricia. (2007) in their book ‘the globalization of world politics: an introduction into international relations’ say that “Policies within the world economy are affected by historical and sociological factors. Analysts in broader tradition of IPE, examine the beliefs, roles, traditions, ideologies, and patterns of influence which shape preferences, behaviors, and outcomes”.  In order to see the US role as a Hegemon and Pakistan’s dependence on it, the historical relationship is important to explore. If the history of the US-Pakistan relations is analyzed in the light of US aid packages to Pakistan, it becomes clear that there have always been political and security interests of the US attached. As a result, if Pakistan could serve US interests, it has been rewarded with foreign aid from the US and other IFIs where the US backed Pakistan. For the sake of better understanding, the relations between the two countries have been divided into different phases as follows:</p><p>The Early Phase of the US Pakistan Economic-Political Relation and Cold War</p><p>The “cold war syndrome”  marked the early interest of the US in Pakistan in 1950s and 60s around the world. The US policy was motivated by its Soviet Containment struggles and Pakistan as a newly independent state was the right choice in South Asia, neighboring China and having close proximity with the Soviet Union. This early Cold War phase clearly shows that realists give precedence to politics over economics and consider that changes in the distribution of political power have a major effect on the nature of international economic relations. Realist assumption is that “the economy is the creature of state” (Cohn H. Theodore, 2008:53).  \nUS realist scholars after World War II focused almost exclusively on security issues . So, the US was determined to take Pakistan in its capitalist block by offering it substantial military and economic aid.  The example of US postponement of 1960s, $43 million loan to Pakistan is important to quote because Pakistan’s friendly relations with communist China forced the US to take this decision.  Furthermore, in regard of the US influence on IFIs decisions, member countries at the session of World Bank Consortium delayed their contributions for Pakistan’s development program.  Thus, the Carter Administration stopped all aid to Pakistan till the end of 1979 due to its nuclear ambitions. </p><p>Renewed US Interest in Pakistan with Soviet’s Afghan Invasion</p><p>After the constrained relations of 1970s when the US was not willing to help Pakistan who had nuclear aspiration, the US interest in Pakistan took afresh with the development in IR such as Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and Iranian Revolution of 1979. As a result of new challenges posed to capitalist US from the communist Soviets, the doors of US aid to Pakistan opens once again. In 1981, a new military and economic aid package of 3.2 billion dollar was announced for Pakistan.   In return Pakistan was obliged to side the US and fight its proxy war in Afghanistan by providing training and logistic support to Afghans. At the time of Soviet’s Afghan invasion, Pakistan was fifth largest recipient of US aid after Israel, Egypt, Korea, and Philippines. According to the second aid package of March 1986, $4020 million was agreed by the two countries. However, it was subject to periodic Congressional ratifications and Presidential certificate, and was to last for the period from October 1987 to September 1993.    These aid packages show the realist conception of the US foreign policy in which these aid packages were associated with the political objective of containing communism and protecting and promoting the US interests through these economic carrots to the LDCs like Pakistan by ignoring its nuclear ambitions. \nRedefined US interests of 1990s and Redefined USAID to Pakistan</p><p>The US interest in 1990s were reshaping with the new development in IR like the disintegration of Soviet Union and its withdrawal from Afghanistan which also marked the end of cold war, and mounting significance of nuclear weapons and terrorism factors. The USAID was negligible in the period of 1990-1998. And this is ironical that this was the era of democratic governments in Pakistan. Pressler Amendment and the Brown Amendment were the main reasons of minimizing the US aid to Pakistan. These were subject to aid authorization by the US Senate in 1985 and 1995. Aid to Pakistan dropped dramatically from 1991 to 2000 to $429 million in economic funding and $5.2 million in military assistance.  </p><p>The Revival of the US Interests in Pakistan </p><p>In the wake of the US terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there have been a remarkable shift in the US relations to Pakistan and its new aid packages. It is ironical that the US claims to be a promoter of democracy and protector of freedom and human rights but this time again it was dictatorship in Pakistan who turned out to be the US all time friend and ally. In this era Pakistan has received about $20 billion assistance from the US. However, the US always blames Pakistan for providing hideouts and training centers to Al-Qaeda and other Mujahideen-Turned-Terrorist . Pakistan’s decision of favoring the US for the sake of foreign aid and economic assistance did not do any good to Pakistan masses and society. Instead the situation is getting precarious and there are more and more terrorist attacks and civilian deaths in Pakistan. There are some indicators which tell us about the deteriorating law and order situation in Pakistan after 9/11 and its decision to side the US. There are 189 civilian deaths from terrorist violence in 2003, 648 in 2005 and 3, 599 in 2007. As far as the social development is concerned, only 2 percent of US aid has been directed towards education since 2002 (‘Casualties of Terrorist Violence in Pakistan’).  All over the world, many people have criticized the US for cutting back on its promised obligations and responsibilities as peace promoter and leader. Furthermore, it often ties its foreign policy objective with the assistance it provides to LDCs in from of economic aid. However, “…Financial and technical assistance should be aimed exclusively at promoting the economic and social progress of developing countries and should not in any way be used by the developed countries to the detriment of the national sovereignty of recipient countries” (‘International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade’ UN General Assembly Resolution 2626 (XXV) October 24, 1970  para 45-47).  \n  \nAfter 9/11 the aid package worth $3 billion and the forgiveness of outstanding debt to the US and other Western nations, awarded to Pakistan attached many conditions with it including permission from Pakistan for “basing, staging and over flight support” for all U.S. aircraft for the war in Afghanistan, allow America access to naval bases and airports, provide intelligence sharing and cooperation, drop support for the Taliban, and purge the upper echelons of its military and nuclear facilities of religious extremists” (Innocent, Malou (2009).  The then president Musharraf accepted the terms but it cost Pakistan its sovereignty, civilian lives, and the more fierce terrorist attacks and also the American ‘Drone Attacks’ on its soil killing many civilians including women and children. Professor William Easterly, a noted mainstream economics professor on development and aid issues criticizes foreign aid for not having achieved much, despite grand promises (Shah, Anup 2009).  The US has directed aid to regions where it has concerns related to its national security and South Asia is one such region where Pakistan boarders emerging economies like China and borders American adversely who is cursed as belonging to the ‘Axis of Evil’ Iran. \nMore recently another aid package has been passed by the US Congress known as Kerry-Lugar Bill which has awarded aid package worth $7.5 billion to Pakistan and ostensibly, focused more on economic development. However, it also contains highly controversial conditions which interfere with the country’s sovereignty.</p><p>Realist Perspective of the US-Pakistan Relations</p><p>The economy and politics could never be separated and this analysis shows that the US-Pakistan relations are marked with realism and the aid which the US provides to Pakistan irrespective of the form of government in Islamabad is explicitly marked with political incentives. It also shows that Pakistan has largely relied on foreign aid, whether form the US, ISIs or other DCs, for its development but its social and economic condition is deteriorating with every coming government. Corruption, bad governance, feudalism are other issues but the thing is that the US aid not doing any good to Pakistan in fighting back these malaises and neither the former is concerned for latter’s development. In realism, security and survival is the responsibility of the state. And presently, economic development is itself very important for the survival so states (mostly DCs) pay considerable attention to their economic policies. However, Shah (2009) argues that the ‘Security dilemma’ is common fears of competing states because the resources are limited and the rivals are many. Therefore, states build armaments for self-defense  and for this purpose LDCs look outside for backing. “Realists… believe that most powerful states shape the rules of these organizations to fit their own national interests and that IOs serve as “arenas for acting out power relationships” (Cohn H. Theodore, 2008:52)  and we witnessed in the above discussion that how the US exert pressure on IFIs such as the World Bank, WTO etc. </p><p>Hegemonic Powers of the US</p><p>After this analysis we can also safely argue that the US has been playing the role of “exploitative hegemon”  in case of Pakistan. Such hegemon like the US in case of Pakistan “exerts leadership out of self interest and is more inclined to use coercion to enforce compliance” such as the threat to sanctions and withdrawal of aid. The US has a strong incentive to exert authority in IPE and has huge shares in IFIs as well so it is not a concern for her to coerce countries like Pakistan. As for instance, a simple majority is needed in most IMF, but majorities of 75 and 85 percent are required for some important decisions; these special majority votes give an effective veto to the United States, the EU, and the LDCs. However, the LDCs are such large, unstructured group of states with few resources that they can hardly unite to block an IMF decision. Thus, the IMF’s weight voting system favors the interests and objectives of North (Cohn H. Theodore, 2008:132). \nIn spite of statistical problems, there is no dearth of proofs suggesting that the US can apply an influence on IFIs lending. Kapur (2002), for instance, contends that “the US enjoys pre-eminence within the World Bank despite a sharp decline in voting power from 35% in 1947 to 16.5% in 1999”. Kapur states three reasons for the continued US preeminence: the US willingness to exercise power; few pressures from other shareholders; and it is an inevitable outcome of what Nye (1990) has dubbed the “soft power” of the United States: Today a much higher percentage of World Bank staff is educated in the US compared to the early years, and the shaping of World Bank policies are heavily influenced by a number of US-based civil-society actors (academia, think tanks, NGOs, etc.) (Anderson, Thomas Barnebeck, Hansen, Henrik & Markussen, Thomas, 2005:3). </p><p>Dependence of Pakistan on the USAID and its Sophisticated Technology</p><p>Pakistan has highly been dependent on the US for its economic and military aid. Pakistan’s imports from the US include sophisticated weaponry, arms, fighter jets, helicopters and other technology used by Pakistani armed forces. South Asia has two nuclear forces namely India and Pakistan and two are age old foes. So, Pakistan is always in need for foreign assistance for its survival and security due to Indian threat. Dependency theory asserts that “the dependence of less developed countries on primary product exports put them at a marked disadvantage” (Cohn H, Theodore, 2008:101) , if the US withholds its economic and military aid and relation between the two deteriorate, Pakistan will face grater set back naturally. Dependency theorists like Andre Gunder Frank argue that “external factors related to global political economy are primarily responsible for constraining developments in South. \nDependency theorists further argue that “the development of capitalist economies in the core required the underdevelopment of the periphery” (Cohn H, Theodore, 2008:102).  Ominously, the United Nations Development Program has reported in 1996 that 70 developing countries were poorer then than they were in 1980 and 43 were poorer than they were in 1970 (Bandow, Doug, 2002).  Dependency theorists assert that “LDCs may have been under-developed in the past; they only became underdeveloped as a result of their involvement as peripheral countries with countries in the core.” (Cohn H, Theodore, 2008:102).  Hence, LDcs could not escape from underdevelopment as long as they retain linkages with the capitalist core. Peter Boone of the London School of Economics and Center for Economic Performance says in this regard that “long-term aid is not a means to create growth,” because, “aid does not promote economic development for two reasons: Poverty is not caused by capital shortage, and it is not optimal for politicians to adjust distortion policies when they receive aid flows.” (Bandow, Doug, 2002:34).  \nSame is the case with Pakistan who has received the major blows on its economy due to increased terrorism resulted by the past wrong policies and helping outside powers for aid which make few selected greedy politicians rich at the cost peace, prosperity, sovereignty, and the lives of several innocent civilians. </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>Politics and economy are inter-related and can not be separated. Realism still plays a very important role in the IPE as there are strong political incentives behind states foreign policies. The developed countries such as the US always exploit and enrich at the cost of exploitation of poor. The US relations with Pakistan clearly indicate US political objectives behind its lending to Pakistan and it also enjoys unparalleled influence in IFIs, IOs and other DCs of the core. Moreover, when the US provides, aid it never take into consideration, the recipient country’s needs and most of the portion of aid goes to the corrupt politicians to win their favor for letting the US to use their territory for the protection of its vested interests world-wide. So, foreign aid does not contribute to the recipient country’s development but its hampers development and promotes only the donor’s political and long-term economic incentives. </p><p>
