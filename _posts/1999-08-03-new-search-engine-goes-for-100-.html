New search engine, <a href='http://www.alltheweb.com/' title='FAST Search'>FAST Search</a> is aiming to index the entire web, and to be up to date at all times. FAST claims to already hold 200m URLs, around 25% of the estimated total of pages available, that it can search them in under a second and that it can rebuild its index in under 12 hours. Its aim is to build a search engine which covers pretty much the entire web, and is very nearly up to date at all times.<p></p>If this is true, it compares extremely well with existing search engines Northern Light, previously providing the best coverage at 16% of the Web, AltaVista (15.5%) and HotBot (11.3%), all of which also have significant issues with content expiry.</p>Catch the full story at <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_410000/410251.stm' title='Good old BBC'>the BBC</a>.
