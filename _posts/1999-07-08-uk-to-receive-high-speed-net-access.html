In perhaps the most intelligent move since the introduction of internet access in the UK, the telecoms operator, OFTEL, has announced a recommendation that BT should be forced to unbundle the local loop. The local loop is the last part of any telephone connection from a house to the nearest exchange, and is currently the reason that BT holds the UK in a technological death-grip. The official <a href="http://www.oftel.gov.uk/competition/llu0799.htm" target="_blank">OFTEL announcement</a> is available, as is the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/the_company_file/newsid_387000/387862.stm">BBC News story</a>. <P></p>In response, BT has announced that they have placed a multi-million pound order for ADSL technology from Alcatel and Fujitsu. This is expected to bring DSL technology to approximately 10% of the UK population sometime in the next year.
