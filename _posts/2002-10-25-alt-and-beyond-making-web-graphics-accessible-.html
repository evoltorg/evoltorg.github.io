<h2>Alt and beyond: Making web graphics accessible</h2></p><p>Many developers still view graphics and accessibility as being on opposing </p>  ends of the web development scale. The truth is that including graphics in your </p>  documents does not mean your page has to be any less accessible. In fact, as </p>  we will see later in this article, graphics can be used to enhance the accessibility </p>  of a page. There are, however, a few key techniques that you can employ to ensure </p>  that you don't have to construct alternative &quot;Text-Only&quot; documents. </p>  The web truly is the last frontier where we can treat all people equally with </p>  &quot;one size fits all&quot; web documents. There is just a little bit extra </p>  we need to do to achieve this.</p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>What's the alternative?</h2></p><p>A key technique in producing accessible graphics in your web documents is utilizing </p>  the alt attribute. For every image that appears on your site you should include </p>  the alt attribute with no exception. Shortly, we will see how easy it is to </p>  root out missing alt attributes and also why we should take care in crafting </p>  alternative representations of our site graphics. Firstly though, lets find </p>  out what the alt attribute does.</p></p><p></p><p>Employing an alt attribute in your image tag is this simple: <code>&lt;img </p>  src=&quot;logo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;logo&quot; /&gt;</code>. What this actually </p>  does is to provide a textual representation of your graphic for users who do </p>  not have graphical browsers. Such users include blind and low vision people </p>  whose screen readers will audibly render the value of the alt attribute or text </p>  only browsers such as lynx that will render the alt text only. This technique </p>  is not only of benefit to users with disabilities. Mobile Internet devices are </p>  becoming increasingly popular, and many still don't render graphics but can </p>  deal with alt attributes. </p></p><p></p><p>By now, I am hoping you are sold on using alt attributes for every image on </p>  your site. If you are, the first thing you will want to do is root out all the </p>  missing tags around your site. Using <a href="http://bobby.watchfire.com" target="_blank">Watchfire's </p>  Bobby</a> this is an easy task. Just punch in your <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> and scan the resulting </p>  report for Priority 1 errors. This is where you will be able to find out exactly </p>  how many instances of missing alt attributes are on your site, and where you </p>  will find them. Now we have a list of offenders and we can deal with them accordingly.</p></p><p></p><h2>Telling it like it is</h2></p><p></p><p>Of course, you can just enter empty alt attributes and Bobby would not find </p>  any errors. But that would achieve nothing in reality other than wasting your </p>  own time. If you don't use the alt attribute correctly you may as well not use </p>  it at all.</p></p><p></p><p>The first rule of alternative text is to make it coherent with the image. The </p>  biggest misuse of alt is to put a snappy caption or joke reference that doesn't </p>  necessarily have any reference to the image it is associated with. Don't do </p>  it. An alt attribute is the only way someone without a graphical browser can </p>  make sense of an image, so you shouldn't waste it. Be straight to the point, </p>  but most of all &quot;represent&quot;.</p></p><p></p><p>Look at these two tags for images:</p></p><p></p><p><code>&lt;img src=&quot;logo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;logo&quot; /&gt;<br></p>  </code><code>&lt;img src=&quot;logo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;WiseGuysMedia: accessibility </p>  consultations&quot;&gt;</code></p></p><p></p><p>The first one is better than nothing, but the second one is so much better. </p>  It tells you a great deal more about what my logo is and the text also looks </p>  good at the head of every page in a text only browser. </p></p><p></p><p>The importance of alternative representations is clear when they are used for </p>  navigation buttons. Without a textual representation, non-graphical browsers </p>  will not be able to tell the user anything about the link other than the full </p>  URL of where it points to. The user will not be able to get around your site </p>  and hence won't be hanging round for long. If you use individual images for </p>  image maps as navigation then you should also ensure that you don't just give </p>  an alt attribute to the main image. You need to add alt attribute to the &quot;hotspots&quot; in the map</p>  also like this:</p></p><p></p><p></p><textarea name="textarea" cols="35" rows="10" wrap="off" class="code" style="width: 100%" onFocus="this.select()"></p><img src="navigation.gif" alt="Navigation." usemap="#Map" /> </p><p><map name="Map"></p>  <area shape="rect" coords="95,4,138,25" href="#" alt="contact" /></p>  <area shape="rect" coords="51,4,94,25" href="#" alt="about" /></p>  <area shape="rect" coords="7,4,50,25" href="#" alt="home" /></p></map></p></textarea></p></p></p><p></p><p>Another thing to watch out for with alt attributes is images that appear side </p>  by side. Look at this code:</p></p><p></p><p><code>&lt;img src=&quot;dog&quot; alt=&quot;my dog eating&quot;&gt;<br></p>  &lt;img src=&quot;cat&quot; alt=&quot;my cats head&quot;&gt;</code></p></p><p></p><p>For a text only browser, and screen reader the out put would be along these </p>  lines.</p></p><p></p><blockquote>"my dog eating my cats head"</blockquote></p><p>Besides landing you in trouble with animal rights activists, it can also be </p>  very confusing. When you are rendering images side by side, end each alt attribute </p>  with a simple full stop to put everything in context. </p></p><p></p><p>Above, I stated that every image should have an alt attribute. This includes </p>  spacers and images that do not convey any meaning whatsoever. This is one occasion </p>  when you can leave the value of the alt attribute empty: <code>&lt;img src=&quot;spacer&quot; </p>  alt=&quot; &quot; /&gt;</code>. The reason for doing this is that every time </p>  a text only browser or screen reader or text-only browser comes across an image, </p>  it will render the filename if no alt attribute is present. This can be very </p>  annoying and also confusing. So for images that really have no purpose other </p>  than decoration, an empty alt attribute will render nothing. This is much better </p>  than listening to the file name of every decorative image on your site. Naturally, </p>  the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> / <acronym title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> puritans amongst us will tell you that you should be using <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> </p>  for positioning and decoration as opposed the older methods of spacer images </p>  - they have a point.</p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>If a picture paints a thousand words...</h2></p><p>Before you run off and start plastering your site with alt attributes, just </p>  remember that a good rule of thumb with them is to be concise and to the point. </p>  Some pictures require more than several words to describe them and this is where </p>  we need to go beyond the alt attribute.</p></p><p></p><p>Consider this scenario. I have a picture of my favorite piece of art. To render </p>  it textually I could put this:</p></p><p></p><p><code>&lt;img src=&quot;art.gif&quot; alt=&quot;My favorite piece of art&quot; </p>  /&gt;</code></p></p><p></p><p>OK, it does have an alt attribute, but it doesn't really tell you much. On </p>  the other hand, I could always do this:</p></p><p></p><p> </p>  <textarea name="textarea2" cols="35" rows="10" wrap="off" class="code" style="width: 100%" onFocus="this.select()"></p><img src="medusa.gif" </p>alt="My favourite piece of art, The Raft of the Medusa. </p>It depicts the helpless passengers and crew of the French ship Medusa.</p>The large canvas (16 by 23 feet) with its twisting figures in desperate </p>hope at the sighting of a rescue ship" /></p></textarea></p></p></p><p></p><p> It works, sure, but it makes my <acronym title="Extensible Hyper Text Markup Language">(X)HTML</acronym> </p>  bulky and maybe my site user doesn't want to listen to or read all of that description. </p>  There is a solution. It's another attribute we can connect to image tags when </p>  the image requires a longer description. It is imaginatively titled the <code>longdesc</code> </p>  attribute. The beauty of this attribute is that you can still use and alt attribute </p>  along side a long description attribute that references a separate more detailed </p>  textual representation of the image. You do it like this:</p></p><p></p><p><code>&lt;img src=&quot;art.gif&quot; alt =&quot;My favorite piece of art: </p>  long description available&quot; longdesc=&quot;medusa.html&quot; /&gt;</code></p></p><p></p><p>All I need to do now is create a separate html document with a longer description </p>  of my image called &quot;medusa.html&quot;.</p></p><p></p><h2>A caveat, as always</h2></p><p></p><p>Whatever standards we have at our disposal, it is the browsers and user-agents </p>  that give us real world constraints. With <code>longdesc</code>, this is still </p>  a question of support. Newer assistive technologies can handle the longdesc </p>  attribute, but many browsers still don't support it. At the <a href="http://ncam.wgbh.org/" target="_blank">National </p>  Center for Accessible Media</a>, a technique that has become widely recognized </p>  has been developed to overcome this problem. The technique is to place a link </p>  to the long description around an uppercase [D] directly below the associated </p>  image. Whilst this is not a standard, it is widely recognized amongst the disabled </p>  community. The output would look something like this below the image: [<a href="/Alt_and_beyond_Making_web_graphics_accessible#" title="This links to a longer description of the image above">D</a>] </p>  with the link pointing to your long description document. You can also use a title on the link such as <code>title="This links to a longer description of the image above"</code> to give the user another clue. </p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Accessible Graphics revisited</h2></p><p>So far we have concentrated on supplying alternative text for graphics, but </p>  we can also use guidelines that help us make graphics more accessible for browsers </p>  that can render them. There are many circumstances where users with disabilities </p>  can see your graphics, but care must still be taken to ensure they do not impede </p>  their ability to use your web documents.</p></p><p></p><p>Although we can alternatively represent it, try to limit the amount of text </p>  you include in your graphics. Some low vision users view web documents through </p>  screen magnifiers. When the text in graphics is zoomed in, it can appear very </p>  distorted of blurred. If you are going to use text in graphics, the following </p>  guidelines can help make them more accessible:</p></p><p></p><ul></p>  <li>Make fonts sizes as large as possible.</li></p>  <li>Use simpler block fonts and avoid anti-aliasing if possible.</li></p>  <li>Use good color contrast between the text and background. </li></p></ul></p><p>For users with dyslexia or other learning difficulties, graphics can be both </p>  the best and the worst of the web. Complex instructions can be represented by </p>  graphics that would be much simpler for a user with a learning difficulty to </p>  comprehend. Examples include technical data or guides to completing a web payment </p>  process. However, very bright or animated graphics can easily distract a dyslexic </p>  user from content on your site and make it difficult for them to concentrate. </p>  <a href="http://www.section508.gov/" target="_blank">Section 508</a> advises </p>  that images should not flicker between 2 and 55 times per second. That is basically </p>  one major change per second. </p></p><p></p><p>Developing accessible web sites should not be about sacrificing your design </p>  and graphics. Ensuring that every image is represented alternatively and correctly </p>  is far more important than removing it from your site. A little care and attention </p>  to the actual design of your graphics can also assist not only users with disabilities, </p>  but also every user of your web documents,<br></p></p>
