I am watching very interesting</p><p>Bmurugen\n================================================================================</p><p>\nThere are a lot of sites out there showing book video. BookVideoTV, BookTelevision and of course CSPAN, but I like how BN.com and Reader's Entertainment TV have specific genre channels and original shows. There's just more to see and I can be specific in what genre I'm interested in. Anyone else watch online tv? </p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.readersentertainment.tv"> Reader's Entertainment </a>
