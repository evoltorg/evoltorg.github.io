excerpt: "The W3C approved its latest recommendation: Extensible Stylesheet Language. Essentially, XSL is to XML documents what CSS is to HTML."

<p>The <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> this week recommended <a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/2001/REC-xsl-20011015/" title="XSL specification" target="offsite">Extensible Stylesheet Language</a> (XSL). The spec dictates how XML documents can be displayed and formatted, and is, in a basic sense, the XML-version of <a href="http://www.w3c.org/Style/CSS/" title="CSS info from the W3C" target="offsite">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS).</p></p><p><p>CSS is still valid to use for X/HTML-based documents, or, as long as no structural changes are required, XML-based ones. </p></p><p><p>Used with XSL's sister recommendation <a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116" title="XSLT specification" target="offsite">XSL Transformations</a> (XSLT) &mdash; which was approved in November of 1999 &mdash; Web developers can manipulate XML data and render it to a readable, formatted page.</p></p><p><p>For example, XSL and XSLT can use the same XML-source to create a Web page or a book. XSL allows for complex layouts thanks to its reliance on unique formatting objects (for example, "footnote", "subhead") and properties.</p></p><p>The W3C's <a href="http://www.w3c.org/Style/XSL/" target="offsite">XSL site</a> has more information, including tutorials and mailing lists.
