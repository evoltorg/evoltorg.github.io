American opportunists have been given one less reason to register certain domain names in hopes of selling them for big bucks. <P> The United States Senate passed a bill late Thursday that would impose a $100,000 fine for anyone registering a domain name, associated with an owned trademark, with the bad-faith intent of selling it for a profit. <P> The bill is actually a refined version of an ealier bill that would have restricted the use of trademarks in domain names for other purposes, such as spoof or protest sites like <a href="http://www.pepsibloodbath.com/">www.PepsiBloodBath.com</a>. <P>  As per usual, however, the bill can only be used in the US, leaving the profiteering market open to the rest of the world.   <P></p>For more details, and the complete story, check out <a href="http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9908/06/cybersquatting.reut/index.html">CNN.com</a>. <P> <P> <P> <P>
