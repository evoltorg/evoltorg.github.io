<p>\n<a href="http://mozilla.org/" target="_new" title="Opens in new window">Mozilla.org</a> has officially released the 1.0 version of Mozilla, which, of course, includes the Gecko rendering engine.\n</p></p><p><p>\nSince 1998, when Netscape opened up the source code to allow development of a new browser, through the aquisition of Netscape by AOL in 1999, followed by the release of Netscape 6.0 (built on beta versions of Mozilla) two and a half years after the Mozilla project was launched, the entire project has been alternately assaulted for taking way too long and being too buggy and praised for holding up standards and open source as an ideal.\n</p></p><p><p>\nMost recently, <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-920242.html" target="_new" title="'Netscape 7.0 rekindles browser battles' on News.com; opens in new window">AOL released the first Netscape 7 Preview Release</a> (no telling how many more there may be), although that happened before the release of Mozilla 1.0.  Most likely, the final 7.0 release will be based on Mozilla 1.0.\n</p></p><p><p>\nOf course, with AOL now testing Netscape in CompuServe, threatening to deploy it to the AOL service, and given that Mozilla is open source, it will be interesting to see how this release impacts the suit AOL Time Warner has filed against Microsoft for strong-arm browser practices.  While this release itself isn't going to change the state of the browser wars overnight, it's an awfully big symbol to be held up in court.\n</p></p><p><p>\nCheck out some of the <a href="http://evolt.org/search/index.html?keywords=mozilla">articles on Mozilla here at evolt.org</a>.\n</p></p><p>\n<h2>Features</h2></p><p><p>\nThe following is pulled from a <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article2278.html" target="_new" title="Read the announcement; opens in new window">release over on MozillaZine.org</a> that trumpets the arrival of Mozilla 1.0.
