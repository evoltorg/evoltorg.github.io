I feel  ill every time I hear another argument over what  the purpose of the Web is. Whether community,  information, design or whatever: exactly what  gives some joker on a mailing list the idea that  it's up to him to decide the ultimate purpose of  millions of Web sites?  <P> The Web is a lot of things to a lot of very  different people. Let's face it: for some, it's  all about free porn, which is OK by me. In fact, I  love those guys. They don't run around trying to  convince other people of the rightness and  righteousness of their opinion.  <P> The Web has grown from something very experimental  to become big. So big that parts of it now warrant  TV commercials. Something that big can accommodate  more than one view. <P> I'm going to type this very slowly so that  everyone can understand what I'm trying to say:  The Web can be about more than one thing.  <P> Project Gutenburg, the {fray}, Amazon.com, and  Bigbob's Web Chat are all going in different  directions, but none of them should be denied FTP  rights because they don't live up to some yahoo's  idea of the Web As It Should Be.  <P> Same goes for sites that are just about making  something pretty, or unusual, or flashy. Some turn  out to be ugly and others are kind of cool, but  you wouldn't believe how bent out of shape certain  people get over them. It's not just Jakob Nielsen,  either. Anyone who has ever spent time on a  mailing list devoted to an aspect of the Web  development field knows that jodi.org is bound to  send someone's blood pressure through the  ceiling.  <P> This is what I always want to tell these people:  Calm down. The existence of sites that you think  are wasteful doesn't harm you in any way. It  doesn't mean you have to stop adding content to  the Web. If you think Gabocorp is so awful, just  don't go there. You waste your breath and my time  when you constantly complain about the fact that  it exists.  <P> So please, find something else to gripe about. As long as it isn't frames. <P> <P>
