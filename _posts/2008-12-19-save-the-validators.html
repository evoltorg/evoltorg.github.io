<p></p>Any front-end web developer knows how much the <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/">World Wide Web Consortium validators</a> have done not just for our markup skills, but for the web itself.  Due to the cost of operations these heavily-used and much-appreciated tools are now in jeopardy.  Web standards advocate and W3C group member Molly Holzschlag writes: <blockquote>That weâ€™ve had the use of validation tools via the W3C for so long and without cost has been a significant component in the teaching and evangelism surrounding Web standards and best practices. To lose these tools would impact that message, not to mention take a certain amount of quality assurance away from the process.
