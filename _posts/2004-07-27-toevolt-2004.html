She lives in Toronto, Canada with her husband and many plants. Tara is currently taking on the (insane) project of gutting and renovating her <a href=\"http://www.taracleveland.com/personal/archives/00000005.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">new house</a>. She and her husband ar taking on most of the work themselves. When she\'s not at work frantically coding or designing, you can often find her wearing safety goggles, a respirator, and  a fully loaded tool belt with a circular saw in hand and sawdust at her feet."
