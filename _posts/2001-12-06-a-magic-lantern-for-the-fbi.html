<p>\nAccording to several news sources, the US <a href="http://www.fbi.gov" target="new" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation - opens in new window">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> intends to use keystroke-logging-enabled Trojan horses for their terrorist spy-work.  \n</p>\n<p>\nAn "anonymous source" interviewed for an <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/660096.asp?0na=x21017M32" target="new" title="FBI software cracks encryption wall - opens in new window">MSNBC article</a>, says the FBI's worm is "one of a series of enhancements currently being developed for the FBI's <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/carnivore/foia_documents.html" target="new" title="Carnivore FOIA Documents - opens in new window">Carnivore project</a>... under the umbrella project name of Cyber Knight."\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile some U.S. anti-virus software makers have said they will cooperate with the FBI and avoid detecting Magic Lantern,  Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at <a href="http://www.sophos.com" target="new" title="Sophos Anti Virus - opens in new window">Sophos</a>, questioned the precedent such actions set, according to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/23057.html" target="new" title="AV vendors split over FBI Trojan snoops - opens in new window">an article</a> in <em>The Register</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis bit of news should be of interest to anyone who sends email or publishes on the web. My question is, on what basis does the FBI decide to target an individual for computer espionage?  \n</p>\n<p>\nAs someone who uses email frequently, including participating in publicly-archived mailing lists (such as evolt.org's), and as someone who occasionally writes opinion pieces which are published on the web,  I find these moves, coupled with the "enhanced surveillance procedures" of October's <a href="http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism_militias/20011025_hr3162_usa_patriot_bill.html" target="new" title="USA PATRIOT Act as Passed by Congress - opens in new window">Patriot Act</a>, quite troubling.  Even more troubling is that the word "terrorism" appears to have no generally agreed-upon definition (<em>Wired</em>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,48807,00.html" target="new" title="Who EU Calling a Terrorist? - opens in new window">3 December 01</a>).  \n</p><p>\nWith so many uncertainties, I find myself wondering upon which grounds the FBI will choose to target an individual or group for computer espionage.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>References and Further Reading:</strong>\n</p>\n<em>News and Commentary:</em>\n<ul><li>Benner, Jeffrey.
