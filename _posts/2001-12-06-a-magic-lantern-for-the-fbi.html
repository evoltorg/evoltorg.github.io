<p></p>According to several news sources, the US <a href="http://www.fbi.gov" target="new" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation - opens in new window">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> intends to use keystroke-logging-enabled Trojan horses for their terrorist spy-work.  </p></p></p><p></p>An "anonymous source" interviewed for an <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/660096.asp?0na=x21017M32" target="new" title="FBI software cracks encryption wall - opens in new window">MSNBC article</a>, says the FBI's worm is "one of a series of enhancements currently being developed for the FBI's <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/carnivore/foia_documents.html" target="new" title="Carnivore FOIA Documents - opens in new window">Carnivore project</a>... under the umbrella project name of Cyber Knight."</p></p></p><p></p>While some U.S. anti-virus software makers have said they will cooperate with the FBI and avoid detecting Magic Lantern,  Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at <a href="http://www.sophos.com" target="new" title="Sophos Anti Virus - opens in new window">Sophos</a>, questioned the precedent such actions set, according to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/23057.html" target="new" title="AV vendors split over FBI Trojan snoops - opens in new window">an article</a> in <em>The Register</em>.</p></p></p><p></p>This bit of news should be of interest to anyone who sends email or publishes on the web.

Even more troubling is that the word "terrorism" appears to have no generally agreed-upon definition (<em>Wired</em>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/conflict/0,2100,48807,00.html" target="new" title="Who EU Calling a Terrorist? - opens in new window">3 December 01</a>).  </p></p><p></p>With so many uncertainties, I find myself wondering upon which grounds the FBI will choose to target an individual or group for computer espionage.</p></p></p><p></p><strong>References and Further Reading:</strong></p></p></p><em>News and Commentary:</em></p><ul><li>Benner, Jeffrey.
