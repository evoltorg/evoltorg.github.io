Following what seems to be a growing trend in the industry, Macromedia <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/1999/index_free_playersource.fhtml" target="_new">announced</a> today that it plans to license its source code at no cost. This will open up the number of applications that will be using Flash for *sure*, IMHO. I think we'll start seeing flash players in all sorts of new Internet enabled devices. Way to go Macromedia!
