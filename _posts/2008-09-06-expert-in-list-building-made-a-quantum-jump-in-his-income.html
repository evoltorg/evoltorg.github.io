Tellman Knudson has created a multi-million Internet business teaching others how to build a highly receptive email opt-in list and a key component to his success is teleseminars. For a time though, Knudson's was mainly successful in starting businesses. Over an eight year period he started no less than eight businesses all of which, in his own words, "failed sadly". However, this did not deter him.</p><p>One of his handicaps is that he is suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Knudson describes himself as being highly creative and having loads of weird ideas. At the same time, he finds it difficult to focus on one thing. In the past, he always wanted to do his own thing and this almost led to financial wreck.</p><p>He attained a measure of success with hypnotherapy. He describes himself as a "incredible hypnotherapist" and built a business that saw him working with 12-14 clients a day, six days a week for one to one and half hours at $75 per hour. However, he was exchanging his time for money and there are only so many hours in a day. Ironically, even although on one level this business was thriving, he was still stressed to pay his rent and was $100,000 in debt.</p><p>Knudson knew he had to make some radical changes to the manner in which he conducted business and turned to Internet Marketing. He also decided to focus on list building because he noticed that this topic was a returning theme in much of the marketing material that he was receiving.</p><p>Bob Proctor says that if your goals do not excite you as well as scare you then you haven't set yourself a goal that is worthy of you. Knudson had no problem with this. He set himself the audacious goal of getting one million subscribers in six months or less. He felt this goal would excite his subscribers as well as get the attention of a few JV (Joint Venture) partners.</p><p>He identified a list of potential JV partners and offered them a proposal. The first scenario were not as established as those he would later approach and they just laughed at him and told him that it couldn't be done. Who could blame them? Knudson wasn't exactly approaching this challenge from a position of strength. Knudson had no product plus he:</p><p>1. Didn't know how to put up web page,\n2. Didn't know how to edit audio,\n3. Didn't know how to write copy,\n4. Had never done a teleseminar, and\n5. Didn't understand the concept of a squeeze page.</p><p>He confess that hearing repeated refusals started to make him feel down but he continued.</p><p>He was turned down 63 times before he received his first yes. When heavyweights such as Joe Vitale and Jay Abraham agreed to come on board others followed suit. It is ironic that those who agreed to support him were more accomplished Internet Marketers than those who originally rejected him. Perhaps they had greater vision than the initial naysayers or may be the long string of rejections enabled Knudson to refine his pitch. No matter, he was up and running.</p><p>However, it certainly wasn't plain sailing. He persuaded seven other individuals to work with him on a percentage basis and work they did. They were putting in 30-50 hour weeks and bringing in about $10,000 per month of which 70% went to Knudson's partners and the remainder was ploughed back into the business to pay for systems such as Instant Audio, Ask Database and further education, all of which helped the business to run more efficiently.</p><p>A major turning point came when Knudson took Alex Mandossian's Teleseminar Secrets mentoring program. Halfway through the program he made $38,000 just by following through on all of the action points.</p><p>Going through one training program at a time, very, very thoroughly and implementing every single technique, every single tactic, every single thing that you had to implement."</p><p>This is a significant success factor. Many people attend training programs but do not follow through. They often blame the program rather than their lack of action for their failure to get results. Then, within one month Knudson's income made a quantum leap from $10,000 to $100,000. In his first year, after doing Teleseminar Secrets, he made $800,000 in sales and from the same size list. Yet for the first eight months he made next to nothing - a measly $10,000 per month.</p><p>An interesting footnote to this case study is that Tell man Knudson didn't achieve his target of one million subscribers but do you think he cares? He is now a highly respected Internet Marketer known for his proficiency in list building. His business turns over seven figures annually something which he attributes to the power of teleseminars.</p><p>and Tell man Knudson has achieved the best of both worlds.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>
