excerpt: "The way we build sites is always changing, but a profound new change on the horizon has nothing to do with accommodating browser incompatibilities or accommodating the latest plug-in technology."

<P>(This article originally appeared on <A href="http://www.alistapart.com" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">A List Apart</A>)</p><P>The way we build sites is always changing, but a profound new change on the horizon has nothing to do with accommodating <A href="http://www.webstandards.org" target="_new">browser incompatibilities</A> or accommodating the latest <A href="http://www.macromedia.com" target="_new">plug-in technology.</A> In the United States, Section 508 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is ticking like a clock ... and the days of <A href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/access/access1.html" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">inaccessible sites</A> may be limited.</P> <P>Section 508 of the <A href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html" target="_blank">WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998</A>, requires all United States Federal Agencies, with websites, to have them accessible to individuals with disabilities, within 24 months of enaction of this law. This will be August 7 2000.<BR></P> <P>To fully understand the impact of this law, and why this will probably change the way we build websites, from the way we write code, the tools we use, and the browsers for viewing the fruits of our labor, a short history of Accessibility legislation is needed.</P> <P></p><H2>A Short History Lesson</H2> <P>The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, was the first piece of legislation designed to ensure that Federal agencies, its contractors, and its financially assisted programs and activities would provide access for Individuals with Disabilities.</P> <P>In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into Law. This legislation enhanced the provisions of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.</P> <P>The Workforce Investment Act of 1998, signed into law on August 7, 1998, updates the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. These changes are designed to strengthen current law to ensure that people with disabilities will have access to electronic and information technology (E&IT).</P> <P>What the Americans with Disabilities Act did for the Brick and Mortar World, Section 508 will do for the Web.</P> <P>Who does Section 508 apply to?<BR>Section 508 applies to Federal departments and agencies. Currently it does not apply to recipients of Federal funds, and does not regulate the private sector. However, states which receive Federal funds under the Technology Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988, are required by that Act to comply with Section 508.</P> <P>However, to the extent that the businesses are covered by the ADA, they have the same legal obligations that they have always had.<BR>One of the lesser known provisions of the The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the <STRONG><I>"effective communication rule"</I></STRONG></P>In a <A href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/foia/cltr204.txt" target="_blank">Letter</A> Dated September 9, 1996, to Sen. Tom Harkin, Deval L. Patrick, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division has this to say, <BLOCKQUOTE> <P>"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires State and local governments and places of public accommodation to furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities, unless doing so would result in a fundamental alteration to the program or service or in an undue burden.  28 C.F.R. . 36.303; 28 C.F.R. . 35.160.  Auxiliary aids include taped texts, Brailled materials, large print materials, and other methods of making visually delivered material available to people with visual impairments."</P> <P>"Covered entities under the ADA are required to provide effective communication, regardless of whether they generally communicate through print media, audio media, or computerized media such as the Internet.  Covered entities that use the Internet for communications regarding their programs, goods, or services must be prepared to offer those communications through accessible means as well."</P></BLOCKQUOTE> <P>Lets take a look at the new rules.</P> <H2>What a Pixel Mechanic Needs to Know.</H2> <P>The Electronic and Information Technology Access Advisory Committee published its<A href="http://www.access-board.gov/pubs/eitaacrpt.htm" target="_blank"> Proposed Standards </A>on May 12, 1999.<BR>The Final Standards will be Completed on or by February 7, 2000.</P> <P>The Information for pixel mechanics are;</P> <BLOCKQUOTE> <P>5.3.3<BR>If the E&IT utilizes Web based information or applications...

This is the good news. A short peek at the Source, on any dozen Federal Websites, let's you know that currently a lot of different editor programs are being used.
