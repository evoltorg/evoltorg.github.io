<p>So you code, eh? Got a pretty sharp brain? Make sure  you keep your body up to par! The healthier your body, the clearer your mind, the more comfortable you will be as you sit down to code.        </p> <p>A lot of the stress related problems and distractions  that we have can be quickly alleviated though simple exercises. Here  are some that I've found have worked well for me. This routine is  designed to stretch almost every muscle in your body. It is also  designed to fit  <em>practically</em> into a coder's daily routine,  once you get used to it, will take about 15 to 20 minutes tops. It is  ideal for deadline related stress. I suggest doing this twice per  high-stress eight hour period.</p> <p>The results will be that your body will be far more  comfortable, relaxed, your mind will be clearer, and it'll make  reaching that deadline easier. My belief is that it's better to take  a couple of 15 minute breaks that lead to increased productivity,  than to spend the time in fruitless stress.</p> <P>  <!-- Disclaimer --> <P> <p><strong>Caveat</strong></p> <p>I'm not a medical doctor, physical therapist, or an  accredited health expert of any kind. I'm someone who has had a  variety of physical discomforts in the past and have studied how my  body works to successfully overcome them. I am knowledgeable on these  topics, but in no way should this be considered medical advice. I  suggest that if you have physical issues of any nature, bring them to  the attention of your doctor, and ask for her recommendation  regarding the suitability of these exercises for you. That having  been said...</p> <P>  <!-- Background --> <P> <p><strong>A gentle background, some body basics</strong></p> <p>This is a deliberately  brief overview of some  elements to keeping an overall state of health.  <strong>Note:</strong> If you are familiar with basics of physiology,  you may wish to go straight to the <a  href="/Coders_Health_Tips_Stretching#exercises">exercises</a>.</p> <p>Muscles are groups of fibers. The fibers consist of  cells that do one thing exclusively: They contract. Tension and  stiffness is often a result of the muscle cells being constantly  stimulated. Stretching provides the balance by giving them the  "relax" signal, and by litterally causing them to expand. </p> <P>  <!-- Demonstration --> <P> <p><strong>Demonstration</strong></p> <p>Try the following: Raise your forearm for a moment,  move your hand down. The action was created by a muscle directly  underneath the forearm. Now raise your hand. The pulling muscle is on  the top of your forearm. Mechanically, a contracting muscle brings a  body part from one position to another. If you aren't sure which  muscle in effect, simply attend to the direction of the motion. As a  general rule of thumb, the direction of the motion will point you to  the muscle(s) in action.</p> <P>  <!-- Excercise --> <P> <p><strong>Exercise</strong></p> <p>A very important factor in keeping your body feeling  good is that of healthy exercise. The value that exercise brings is  that it enables the body to adapt to a stress. The response of the  body is very similar to what the body does when it's young.  Chemically and biologically, you are essentially telling it to  reproduce youth, and grow.</p> <P>  <!-- Overall Health --> <P> <p>There are five important general areas to consider for  overall well-being:</p> <P> <ol> <li><strong>Nutrition.</strong> Keeping your  body fueled with clean (fresh, natural, unprocessed) foods and  liquids.</li> <li><strong>Strength.</strong> Available  mechanical force; increased by responding to a stress.</li> <li><strong>Suppleness.</strong> Keeping the  cell walls flexible, thus increasing your range of motion, and the  ability to remain relaxed) This article focuses on suppleness.</li> <li><strong>Cardio-vascular  efficiency.</strong> Basically, the ability to process and deliver  oxygen, and expel waste gases efficiently.</li> <li><strong>Rest.</strong> Allowing your body  the time to clear out toxins, make use of nutrients and regenerate  tissue.</li> </ol> <P>  <!-- General Nutrition --> <P> <p><strong>General Nutrition</strong></p> <p>A few obvious things will help keep your cells,  therefor your body, in good condition. Keep them well watered. Drink  lots of clean liquids. Pure, fresh water is the best. Juices are  great too. Alcohol and coffee have the tendency to limit the amount  of water a cell can retain, thus affect the ability to remain  comfortable, relaxed, and clear headed. Keep your cells well fed with  quality fruits and vegetables. We'll keep it to this, since nutrition  isn't in the scope of this article. Well enough said that the better  you feed your body, the more effective a tool it will be for you.</p> <P>  <!-- Strength --> <P> <p><strong>Strength</strong></p> <p>Strength is a description of your muscle's cell  abilities to contract. The more a cell can contract, the stronger it  is. The more cells you can recruit in a motion, the stronger you are.  The value of strength is reflected in myriads of daily ways: Opening  a door, reaching for a book at an extended arm's range, opening a  bottle of beer. (Did I say that out loud?)</p> <P>  <!-- Suppleness --> <P> <p><strong>Suppleness</strong></p> <p>Suppleness is the ability for muscle and sinew to  extend to it's full range, thus permitting our joints a full range of  motion. It has as a very nice side effect: the increased ability to  maintain muscular relaxation, and thus the bio-mechanical machine can  operate more efficiently. Of all the essential elements to health,  this seems to be one of the most overlooked.</p> <P>  <!-- Cardio --> <P> <p><strong>Cardio-Vascular Efficiency</strong></p> <p>Cardio-Vascular efficiency is perhaps one of the least  overlooked, yet one of the most misunderstood in terms of it's  application in daily life. Having a strong heart and efficient lungs  isn't just for sports. It keeps our mind clear, and our body rested  for longer periods of time. This means that we can get more juice  from an overnight charge. It also boosts our immune system, so we get  to forgo sick days. (Good for free-lancers, bad for full timers  <g>)</p> <P>  <!-- Rest --> <P> <p><strong>Rest</strong></p> <p>Finally, another often overlooked item is that of  rest. The body and mind needs rest. There is a classic example of the  Code Warrior's All Nighter feeding off Jolt Cola and Pizza. Don't do  it. Respect your body's natural cycles, and it will reward you by  feeling good, and thinking straight.</p> <p>Taking care of your body as a routine will improve  your ability to think clearly, your energy levels, your ability to  handle stress (deadlines anyone?) and will enhance your life away  from the monitor as well. I think that it's quite reasonable to  assume that if you keep these exercises up for three months*, and do  them in a gentle, respectful way, that you will notice an extremely  positive and measurable effect on your general state of well  being.</p> <P> <p> *Think three months is long? How many three months  periods in your life have you given up, that had they now been past  you would have been glad to reap the benefits of feeling great?</p> <P>  <!-- The Excercises --> <P> <a name="exercises"></a> <h3>The Exercises</h3> <P> <p>The following exercises will focus on suppleness,  relaxation, and to a small degree, strength.</p> <p><strong>Remember:</strong> If you haven't stretched  regularly for a long time, go slow! It takes a while for the body to  change.</p> <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Go into your stretches  slowly and gently. When faced with the unfamiliar, the body responds  by tightening up. Hold it very gently, the body will suddenly relax  (in about 15-20 seconds) and the stretch will begin.</p> <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Remember to keep  breathing deeply and gently throughout the exercises. The goal is one  of relaxation, and suppleness, not exertion and teeth gritting agony.  These exercises should<i>feel good</i>.</p> <P>  <!-- Neck Excercises --> <P> <p><strong>Neck Exercises</strong></p> <p>Got sore neck muscles from being hunched over at your  computer? This is usually a result of keeping an unnatural body  position for extended amounts of time. Quite often we lean forward,  with our necks extended towards the monitor. Consequently, the  surrounding muscles tense up in an attempt to compensate.</p> <p><em>Exercise 1</em></p> <p>The neck is a fairly sophisticated structure, owing to  the fact that there is relatively little support for the spine, which  is holding a 15 to 20 lb load that is in constant motion. There are  many little muscles. This exercise bears doing slowly and gently.</p> <P>  <!-- Bowling Ball --> <P> <ol> <li>Stand comfortably, feet shoulder width.  (If you've been sitting all night, <em>stand</em>!)</li> <li>Allow your arms to hang naturally at your  side, your shoulders and neck to relax. Heave a comfortable sigh.</li> <li>Drop your chin to your neck (not  chest?neck) and gently let gravity hold it in place. Notice how  this stretches the muscles in the centre of your back?</li> <li>Very, very slowly, move your head in slow  circle to one side. Notice how the muscles that are being stretched  are in the opposing direction that your head is facing?</li> <li>Let your head roll onto your shoulders;  do<i>not</i> raise your shoulder to meet your head. Time and  flexibility will take care of that.</li> <li>Keep breathing slowly and with relaxation.</li> <li>Continue the circling motion. Don't push  your head down, <em>let gravity do the pulling for you</em>.</li> <li>Repeat three times, both directions.</li> </ol> <P>  <!-- Shrugs --> <P> <p><em>Exercise 2</em></p> <p>If you go to the gym, do shrugs. If you don't, you can  still do these at home. Grab a couple of evenly balanced, and heavy  items (milk jugs with handles, filled to the brim). If you are all  out of milk, you can do this by placing your finger tips under  something heavy and solid like a desk, to provide resistance. If you  have nothing, do the motions, and squeeze the muscle.</p> <P> <ol> <li>Keeping your hands to your side, lift  your shoulders as high as you can. (Don't scrunch your neck  down).</li> <li>Repeat the "I don't know"  motion until the area near your neck, and upper back feel warm. (If  you pay attention, you'll notice that the motion <em>starts</em> in  the middle of your back).</li> <li>If you like, empty handed, you can push  your shoulders as far as possible to the front, release your shrug,  pull your shoulder as far back as is comfortable and return to the  shrug, to create one large rolling motion.</li> <li>Take a minute break. Do this three times  and feel that head ache disappear!</li> </ol> <P>  <!-- Stretching the Back --> <P> <p><strong>Back: A follow up to shrugs</strong></p> <P> <ol> <li>Stand Straight, pretend that someone is  lifting you by the hair of your scalp.</li> <li>Touch your chin to your neck, if you can.  (If you can't, start here!).</li> <li>Gently and slowly curl over (like a piece  of paper), let your arms hang?don't push them forward, allow  gravity to pull your body. Make sure you keep your knees gently bent  (Don't keep them locked straight). Do this motion gently as far down  as you <em>comfortably</em> can. Hold for a count of about 20, then  uncurl as slowly and gently. If it feels good (and it takes time, go  slow!) you're doing it right. If it genuinely hurts, you're pushing  too fast.</li> <li>Make sure you practice this daily!</li> <li>Repeat three times.</li> </ol> <P> <p>This will stretch every posterior muscle, from the top  of your scalp to your heels. Result? You'll feel great.</p> <P>  <!-- The Front of the Body --> <P> <p><strong>The Other Side</strong></p> <p>Now that we know how to stretch our back, we need to  remember something important: <em>The body is one coordinated item,  not separate pieces.</em> That means we need balance.</p> <p>I know very few people who have flexible trunks,  especially in the "leaning back" department, so we'll go  slow with a few exercises, which once learned will blend  seemlessly.</p> <p><strong>Stretching the front of your body</strong></p> <P>  <!-- Camel --> <P> <p><em>Exercise 1</em></p> <P> <ol> <li>Find a soft surface, and kneel, head and  trunk straight.</li> <li>Keep your feet flat; ie: The tops of your  feet touching the floor.</li> <li>Move your arms to the back, palms facing  the front.</li> <li>Rest the palm of your hands on the soles  of your feet.</li> <li>Gently arch your back and hold.</li> <li>Hold for a count of about 20, then gently  lift back to a kneeling position. If it feels good you're doing it  right. If it genuinely hurts, you're pushing too fast. Slow down!</li> <li>Repeat three times.</li> </ol> <P> <p>This will have the effect of stretching most of your  upper body, including your shoulders and arms.</p> <P>  <!-- Bridge --> <P> <p><em>Exercise 2</em></p> <P> <p>Once you've managed to be able to hold the above  position comfortably,</p> <P> <ol> <li>Walk your hands backwards, roll your foot  onto it's sole. Both fingers and toes should point in the same  direction.</li> <li>Arch your back as high as you can.</li> <li>Hold for a count of about 20.</li> <li>Gently relax your body.</li> <li>Return to the kneeling position.</li> <li>Repeat three times.</li> </ol> <P>  <!-- Forearms --> <P> <p><em>Exercise 3</em></p> <P> <ol> <li>Turn your hands so that they face palm  down, fingers, spread, towards you.</li> <li>Place them on the floor in front of you.</li> <li>Gently lean forward as far as you  comfortably can.</li> <li>Hold for a count of 20 or so.</li> <li>Gently return to your knees.</li> <li>Repeat three times.</li> </ol> <P> <p>At this point we've stretched every front, and back  muscle. We've stretched our necks, shoulders, forearms and hands. Now  we are left with the  "in-side" and "out-side" of  our body.</p> <P>  <!-- Inner Thighs --> <P> <p><strong>The inner thighs</strong></p> <P> <ol> <li>Still kneeling, place your hands in front  of you.</li> <li>Gently let your knees slide apart.</li> <li>Go as far as you are comfortable with.</li> <li>Hold for about 20 counts.</li> <li>Repeat three times.</li> </ol> <P>  <!-- Abs and Lats --> <P> <p><strong>The side abdominals and side of our back.</strong></p> <P> <ol> <li>Stand, keeping your feet slightly wider  than shoulder width.</li> <li>Raise your hands palms forward in a two  handed "Stop!" motion.</li> <li>Turn the finger tip to point at each other.</li> <li>Clasp your hands together.</li> <li>Raise them, in this position above your head.</li> <li>Lean to the side as far as you are  comfortable.</li> <li>Keeping your hands clasped, shoulders  extended, make as big a circle as you can, from the trunk. (Imagine  that your hands are the end of the hand of a clock, and that your  trunk is the pin.)</li> <li>Repeat these circles three times in both  directions.</li> </ol> <P>  <!-- Misc Tips --> <P> <p><strong>Other Tips:</strong></p> <P> <p>Feeling tired? Can't focus? Remember to  <strong><em>breath</em></strong>! Sounds obvious? Deep breathing goes  into the bottom of your belly, not your chest. If you find you need  to clear your mind, walk <em>away</em> from your monitor. Find a  quiet place and take 25 as-deep-and-slow-as-you-can breaths. Stretch  a bit. Now go back to work. Nice difference, eh?</p> <p>I don't know about you, but coffee (love it as I may)  does NOT pick me up. It makes me stupid and dull minded. I keep a  couple of litre bottles of water by me at all times. For some reason  it helps. And having to get up and pee once an hour saves me from  RSI! <g></p> <p>Get away from the monitor. Take a few minutes to keep  your eyes closed. I find this refreshes my eyes more than rubbing  them. Rubbing your eyes isn't a good idea. Optometrists recommend a)  remembering to blink (no joke!) and close your eyes, if possible  provide them with true darkness.</p> <P>  <!-- Conclusion --> <P> <p><strong>All done!</strong></p> <p>That's a quick stretching routine. All exercises are  meant to be followed in order. Remember to be gentle to your body,  especially if it's not used to the exercise. The goal is to make it  feel good so that you can get back to work, not to force it into  performing unnatural acts. Ideally, in a couple of weeks, you should  be familiar enough with this whole routine that you can incorporate  everything simultaneously and fluidly; that is to say, eyes closed,  breathing deeply and the stretches flowing one into the next.</p> <P> <p>Good health and happy coding!
