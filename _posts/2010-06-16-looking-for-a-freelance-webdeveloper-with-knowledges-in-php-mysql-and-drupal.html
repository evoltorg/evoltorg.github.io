Hi, </p><p>I'm base in Europe (Spain and Switzerland) and have several websites and intranet (professional and private, for instance www.skimo.org). Websites are all in drupal and intranet in pure mysql and php.</p><p>I'm looking for a freelance programmer that can help me to do small changes on them (new theme in Drupal, improving interface of intranet, etc...). Those are small programming works but very precise (no need to "think" or design, only programming). </p><p>I would be interested in fiding somebody realable to work with in a hour base. We could do a first test with a work, and if it works... I have plenty of small things to do!</p><p>Please contact me at info@skimo.org.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Josep
