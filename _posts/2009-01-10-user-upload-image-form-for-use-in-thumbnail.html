Hey JP (or anyone who can help),</p>The script that you created (PHP Login Systen with Admin Features) is great!  I've got it working fine on my test site, and now I would like to extend the user database in MySQL to include thumbnail images for profile pictures.  Can you help me in creating the script for to upload the profile thumnails for use in user forums?</p>Thanks,</p>tonedawg</p>   </p>
