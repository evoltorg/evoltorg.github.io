<p>We've become acclimatized to the idea of cookies as privacy invasion.  We, as a group, have come to understand that each time a website tags us with one of these persistent suckers, we may be allowing them to form an idea of our spending and viewing habits.</p></p><p><p>Some people, like myself, have taken the step of installing programs like <a href="http://www.idcide.com" target="_new">IDcide</a>, which prevent the kinds of cookies most often used by tracking networks like <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com" target="_new">DoubleClick</a>.  I kicked back, secure in the knowledge that if I cruise around looking at "www.dccomics.com" I wasn't going to see Batman ads on every webpage and in my mailbox.</p></p><p><p>Unfortunately, it's not simply a matter of <EM>one form</EM> of privacy loss any more.  A company that is now known as <a href="http://www.radiate.com" target="_new">Radiate</a> has taken away yet more of our rapidly receding privacy.  They are the creators of an ad system that opens a hidden browser window and, <EM>without</EM> your knowledge or consent, steadily downloads a stream of ads that it stores for the 'adware' products it supports.  This hidden window 'piggybacks' on your connection, which allows it to bypass your firewalls as you enter your password.  There are over 400 adware programs that use Radiate (formerly Aureate).  They have been blamed with everything from hacking your registry to find your real name to sending the company a list of all programs installed on your computer.</p></p><p><P>While both of those are not true, this is:  When these adware applications are removed, the Radiate components continue on, hidden, stealing your bandwidth.  If this was not bad enough, the ad software was created to allow them to update itself at any time.  Without your knowledge, they can upload and run <EM>any</EM> executable.  Even worse, with the proper spoofing mechanisms, anyone can do this as long as you have their program installed, and at least 22 million of their packages already have.  In the midst of all this, they have the capability to collect very specific information about you.  They deny using your IP address or any further information to target you currently, but their Privacy <a href="http://www.aureate.com:8082/privacy/" target="_new">Statement</a> makes no mention of what they may do in the future.</P></p><p><P>Radiate <a href="http://www.aureate.com/privacy/additionalq.html" target="_new">denies</a> anything beyond basic voluntary information is being served to them. </P></p><p><BLOCKQUOTE>"We do NOT alter the users' web browser.  A component of our ad system is\nactivated when the anonymous user opens their browser.  This component is\nactivated to deliver advertisements to a cache on the users' computer.  The\nsoftware applications in our network will pull ads from this cache when they\nare running.  The use of this cache allows us to deliver ads to applications\nwhich may not be run while the user is online (such as a game that is played\noffline), but which the user can still receive for free or at a discounted\nrate because of the advertising support.  Our license agreement specifies\nthis and informs the user that our technology will connect to the Internet\nubiquitously in order to transfer advertising information and software\nupdates."</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p><P>The key to this statement is the word <EM>ubiquitously</EM>.  Meaning that they\nwill connect to their own servers from your computer on a steady, constant\nbasis.They do, however, admit to one charge :</P></p><p><BLOCKQUOTE>"Advert.dll creates a process anytime your browser is open. \nThis is true.  This process delivers advertisements to a cache on the users\nPC which are displayed while the software is being run.  This works in a\nsimilar way to how the browser works, with content and images (including\nads) being delivered to a cache on the users PC and then are displayed in\nthe browser window."</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p><P>This meaning that at all times your bandwidth may be reduced and, if claims\nof crashing are true, your system may be less stable because of their\nsystem, by their own admission.  </P></p><p><P>Interestingly enough, there is the goofy "show me the money" statement lodged in the offending code.  Radiate somehow thinks the've dodged this obvious flaw with a statement of how text strings work in a dll:</P>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>"Advert.dll contains the string "Show me the money!  I want to be Mike!" \n 	This is true.  It's a text string used by the DLL.  DLLs contain\nmany text strings which are used by the DLL itself.  For example, if\na particular program displayed a window which contained the text "Hello\nWorld", then the "Hello World" text string would be present inside that DLL."\n</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p><P>Network Assoc. - Mcafee <a href="http://vil.nai.com/vil/ve98516.asp" target="_new">denies</a>, specifically, that it is a trojan horse:</P>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>"There is no basis to substantiate the claim or accusation and is therefore\nfalse."</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p><P>Few <A HREF="http://www.theregister.co.uk/000310-000001.html" target="_new">articles</A> mention that just because the most frightening details are false\ndoes not mean that aureate isn't being unethical in their backchannel work.  The <A href="http://grc.com/oo/aureate.htm" target="_new">Opt-out</a> website, run by Steve Gibson, does\nan admirably detailed job of explaining exactly why Aureate/Radiate is still a\nproblem.</P></p><p><BLOCKQUOTE>"Aureate deserved - and continues to deserve today - the "Spyware" moniker\nnot (apparently) because it is sending sensitive personal data out of the\nuser's computer, but because it  deliberately slips into the user's system\nsecretly,  uses the user's Internet backchannel without the user's knowledge\nor permission,  takes pains to remain secretly installed (instructing its\nhosting software to leave it installed upon the host's removal),  masks its\npresence by deliberately suspending its use of the backchannel in the\nabsence of keyboard or mouse activity and  fails to disclose any of this to\nthe typical user who is never fully informed about what's going on. </p><p>When you add to this the fact that the Aureate software  has been\nconclusively found to be directly responsible for significant Windows system\nand Internet browser crashes, and that  it is able to secretly download and\ncause Windows to execute any arbitrary program into the unsuspecting user's\ncomputer, it is indeed difficult to cut these people much slack."</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p><P>Check out, specifically, the "Code of Backchannel Compliance" chart they've\nshown.</P></p><p><BLOCKQUOTE>"As if that weren't sufficient cause for alarm, this Trojan Horse spyware -\nfor that's what it surely must be called - is trivial to "redirect" so that\ninstead of phoning home to one of Aureate's servers, it connects to any\nother arbitrary server on the Internet. It establishes a connection between\nthat unknown server and your computer, sliding right through whatever\ncorporate or personal firewalls you or your employer may have erected\n(because it functions as a browser parasite which hijacks your browser's\nInternet usage permissions). Then it awaits further instructions . . . which\nwe now know at least include "here's an executable file, download and run it\nplease.""</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n"...any malicious hacker who wishes can trivially duplicate the work I did. And, once done, they don't even need to scan the Internet looking for Aureate Trojans . . . since any redirected Aureate Trojans WILL CALL THEM! and await instructions the next time the\nunsuspecting user browses the Internet!"</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p><P>Cheer up!  Check out Simtel's policy, as listed on grc.com:</P>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>"Effective immediately Simtel Management Policy is that any Adware program\nthat continues to run when applications that use it are not running will be\nbanned from the collections. Authors who submit Adware must state that this\nwill not occur.</p><p>The Adware servers have no right to use the user's bandwidth to download ads\nwhile they are running programs that do not use the ads. In my opinion they\nare stealing the user's bandwidth when this occurs."</BLOCKQUOTE></p><p><P>With the <a href="http://www.vortex.com/privacy/current" target="_new">news</a> from privacy advocate channels that RealNetworks' subsidiary <a href="http://www.netzip.com" target="_new">Netzip</a> has created an aptly named program called Download Demon that sends the name and location of <EM>each file</EM> you download back to the company, it is obvious that we have allowed inspiration to strike those who wish to profit on our private thoughts.  Who knows how many software packages are being used this very moment that intentionally hide some kind of snooping capability?  When you find a roach on your floor, you can guarantee a dozen more behind the wall.</P></p><p><P>Companies like these are making their fortune creating what is essentially malicious code.
