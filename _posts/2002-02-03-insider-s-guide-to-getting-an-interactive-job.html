excerpt: "I recently completed an article to help prospective job seekers obtain an edge in finding an interactive job.  It contains years of tips and insight as both an interviewee and interviewer."
---
<p>In the past two years, I have seen hundreds of resumes, </p>        online portfolios, and links to sites built/designed/worked on by people. </p>        I have also spent such an inordinate amount of time on the phone with </p>        prospective employees, trading a million emails, and talking about what </p>        my company is-and where it's going-that I've unwittingly polished my act </p>        for new business presentations. </p></p>      <p>What follows is a collection of tips, stories, and assorted </p>        thoughts intended to help you, the prospective interactive designer/web </p>        developer job seeker, get a leg up on the competition as you look for </p>        work.</p></p>        <h2>Part One: Making Contact</h2></p>      <h3>By phone, e-mail or regular mail?</h3></p>      <p>Phone calls are the most personal of the three and for that </p>        reason they should be avoided for first contact. It is especially difficult </p>        to get people on the phone these days and using voicemail to introduce </p>        yourself may not be the best idea. </p></p>      <p>Snail mail isn't necessarily a bad thing but it is becoming </p>        increasingly rare and that is both a good and bad. On the good side, whatever </p>        you send will likely be opened by someone. On the bad side, what you send </p>        needs to be unique and strong and that could require a lot of effort or </p>        cost to accomplish. Also, we all have too much crap in our offices and </p>        the likelihood that what you send will either be buried or trashed within </p>        a week is highly probable. If you want to make a splash by mail, I would </p>        suggest putting in the effort and creativity required to make a serious </p>        impact. If you do make a big splash, your work will likely be passed around </p>        the office. </p></p>      <p>Today, e-mail is the preferred method of contact. You really </p>        cannot go wrong using it. It can be opened and read at the employer's </p>        leisure, and that will increase the likelihood of their having a favorable </p>        impression of you (out-of-the blue phone calls right before big meetings </p>        or project deadlines tend not to cast you in the best light). Plus, e-mails </p>        are easy to store and find. </p></p>      <h3>What should you put in the email? </h3></p>      <p>Subject lines are like headlines. They ought to be succinct </p>        and to the point. Safe bets for the subject box include, &quot;Candidate </p>        for ______ job&quot; or &quot;Web Developer, John Doe&quot;. Function </p>        always trumps form in e-mail intros.</p></p>      <p>And in the body of the message as well. Don't go overboard-get </p>        to the point. Start by saying &quot;my name is ____ and I am interested </p>        in the job for _____&quot;. Then shamelessly begin stroking the potential </p>        employer's ego by complimenting them personally (if you know their work) </p>        and their company. Exhibiting a knowledge of their company and work is </p>        the beginning of a personal rapport. Address your reader by his/her name. </p>        In other words, make it clear to them that you haven't shotgunned this </p>        same e-mail to a hundred other people. Showing a little intimacy with </p>        a company suggests that they are high on your list of desirable employers. </p>        Finally, tell them specifically why you want to work at their company. </p>        This ensures that you've done your legwork and actually know something </p>        about the company. </p></p>      <p>The most important thing to include is a link to your online </p>        resume/portfolio site. You might also include (but be careful not to include </p>        too much) mentions of previous employers or projects if you think they </p>        will be impressive, interesting or context-specific to the employer. </p></p>      <p>The goal of the email is to get them interested enough that </p>        they want to learn more about you (and will click on your link). Don't </p>        give it all away in the email.</p></p>      <p>General note: if you send an attachment, keep it small and </p>        make sure it is either a .doc, .txt or .pdf file. Ideally, you would attach </p>        nothing but rather include links to your work.</p></p>      <h3>Paper Trails?</h3></p>      <p>I am always a bit surprised nowadays to see a resume printed </p>        on a piece of paper in this business. Don't get me wrong, it isn't a bad </p>        thing to have one, it's just that I think prospective employers would </p>        rather see an online resume. </p></p>      <p>One rant specific to the &quot;skills&quot; section of a </p>        resume: I deplore it when someone lists something (example: xml) on their </p>        resume and then when I question them about it, they say something to the </p>        effect of, &quot;well, I read a book about it&quot; or something similarly </p>        displeasing. For god's sake, if you are desperate to add a catalogue of </p>        acronyms to your resume, at least indicate your level of proficiency with </p>        each one. For instance, are you: an expert, well-versed, vaguely familiar, </p>        or unfathomably ignorant of everything but the letters of the acronym. </p>        Believe me, as an employer, if you let me know how well you know a program, </p>        I will a) appreciate your honesty, and b) be able to understand you better </p>        and see where you might be headed from a personal growth perspective.</p></p>      <p><strong>General note:</strong> the most important thing on a paper resume </p>        is the list of previous employers and specific information about how long </p>        you worked at each one and what exactly you did while there (aside from </p>        refashioning your resume to send to me). </p></p>      <h3>The all-important (online) resume and portfolio!</h3></p>      <p>OK, listen up. This is the most important thing for you </p>        to focus on (until you are invited to an interview). I can determine if </p>        I am interested in someone within about 1-2 minutes (or less) of clicking </p>        on a link to their online portfolio/resume. If you are a designer, this </p>        thing had better look sharp. If you are a developer, you should get someone </p>        that can design to help you create an interface for it and then make sure </p>        you are using some of those &quot;skills&quot; listed on your resume on </p>        that site. </p></p>      <p><strong>General note:</strong> I hate to say never, but I would never hire </p>        someone that did not have a site of his or her own. </p></p>      <p>Things you really should cover on the site</p></p><ul></p><li>traditional </p>        resume type content</li></p><li>screen caps of sites you have worked on</li></p><li>links to </p>        the sites (target a new window please)</li></p><li>descriptions of what the project </p>        was for and what you did on it (this is a great opportunity to answer </p>        questions before they are asked and to begin to sell yourself to the employer)</li></p></ul></p>      <p>Some interesting or unusual ideas that may (or may not) </p>        be worth exploring on your site:</p></p><li>        inclusion of a photograph, video or audio of yourself to help bring a personal element to things;</p></li><li>        an explanation of why you went to and why you left each place of employment (never seen </p></li>   <li>     anyone do this but I would be blown away if someone did it);</p></li>   <li>     a brief bit of commentary of some sort that reveals your personality;</p></li>   <li>     finally, try including a list of sites you admire and include explanations as to why  you appreciate or enjoy them. On that link list train of thought, perhaps also consider listing the 3-5 web sites you frequent most often.</p></li></p></ul>        </p>      <p>Also remember to include current contact information.</p></p>      <p><strong>General note:</strong> try to find the right balance between showing </p>        off your skills and providing useful information. The right combination </p>        will result in a quot;homerun&quot; for you with the potential employer.</p></p><p>      <h2>Part Two: Sitting in Limbo (but not </p>        waiting in vain)</h2></p>      <h3>The two-day rule</h3></p>      <p>First of all, don't take this too literally, but if you </p>        haven't heard back from someone within 1-2 days of contact you can pretty </p>        much count on not hearing from them. The likelihood that an email will </p>        get deleted or buried under others or that a package will get thrown out </p>        or lost increases substantially each day that passes after it was received. </p>      </p></p>      <p>Sometimes, people are too busy to get back right away and </p>        they will later on but consider this: if it takes more than a day or two </p>        to respond to you, what does that say about the potential employer? That </p>        they aren't that committed to finding someone for this job right away </p>        (or even at all)? That they may be lackadaisical later on if you were </p>        to be hired? Perhaps...perhaps not. But things to think about. </p></p>      <p>Definitely follow up with another note if you have not heard </p>        back in more than 5 business days. When following up, communicate (very </p>        briefly) that you are following up on a note about &quot;the job for ____&quot; </p>        and indicate that you are on top of things by recounting that you sent </p>        the note &quot;last Tuesday afternoon (or whenever)&quot; to help politely </p>        remind the recipient that this is your second attempt to contact.</p></p>      <p>If you still don't hear back from them? They are either </p>        not interested in you or are not seriously interested in filling this </p>        job. Regardless, it is likely best to move on. However, if you feel that </p>        this is the one and only job for you, consider other alternatives. (Let </p>        me remind you that if you do this, please recognize that the odds are </p>        already stacked against you so your attempts must be smart and sincere </p>        beyond this point.)</p></p>      <h3>Playing cryptologist: decoding the response (and responding)</h3></p>      <p>Responses can vary greatly but you will likely get some </p>        variant of one of the following two responses: &quot;we are not interested&quot; </p>        or &quot;we are interested&quot;. If you get a response either way, congratulations. </p>        This is not always a given. An added bonus is that this is the first opportunity </p>        you will have to evaluate a potential employer's interest in you. It is </p>        very difficult for them to not reveal some of their hand when they respond </p>        to you. Use this to your advantage and read carefully and then re-read </p>        carefully what they said to you. Use that information to shape the size </p>        and tone of your next communication back to the potential employer. This </p>        is also a good time to reiterate your personal knowledge of the person </p>        or company and communicate your desire to be in this specific job (although </p>        please do this subtly or concisely at this point).</p></p>      <p>Be prepared to answer specific questions immediately and </p>        don't screw around on the money issue (especially considering the economy </p>        right now). Tell them exactly what you are/were making at your last job </p>        and give them a range that you think would be fair based on your skill </p>        set and past experience as well as your interpretation of what the job </p>        would require of you. Don't worry about specifics at this point. That </p>        will turn the employer off because it will appear you are more concerned </p>        about money than the job. But it is helpful and important to establish </p>        a ballpark for compensation to keep things moving forward efficiently </p>        for both sides (you are going to have to talk about it sooner or later </p>        so my advice would be to get it out there as soon as it becomes relevant </p>        or appropriate and perhaps you will prevent either side wasting their </p>        time if there is a significant problem in this respect).</p></p>      <p>Also keep in mind that your response will also tip your </p>        hand to the potential employer. Be sure to include a question or two of </p>        your own. This is wise as it indicates a specific interest in the job </p>        or company on your behalf and also helps increase the likelihood of the </p>        employer continuing the dialog with you (which helps promote a familiarity </p>        and recognition which will set you apart from others). Please don't ask </p>        trivial things or ask too many questions, but one or two carefully worded </p>        questions will show the employer that it is not a one way street and that </p>        you are also evaluating them (something some employers forget or never </p>        realize).<br /></p>      </p></p>      <h2>Part Three: All Things Interview</h2></p>      <h3>Setting it up</h3></p>      <p>Generally, at this point, the employer will dictate next </p>        steps. Some like to continue emailing for a while or will want a quick </p>        phone call interview, still others may wish to go ahead and schedule an </p>        interview in person. You pretty much will need to follow their lead from </p>        here. However, I would recommend that if you receive a favorable response </p>        from a potential employer and you have a &quot;good feeling&quot; that </p>        you spend a little time each day thinking about the company and the job. </p>        This should include everything from considering where they are located </p>        and what the morning and afternoon commutes would be like to considering </p>        the type of people that work there and how you would fit into the corporate </p>        culture or environment. </p></p>      <p>Finally, do some homework on the company and the job. If </p>        possible, talk to others that work or have worked there. Also, talk to </p>        other people in the industry and try to learn about their impression of </p>        the company (keep an open mind here as you never know what you will hear </p>        from someone... good or bad). Other good sources of information are local </p>        news web sites and/or industry specific publications or sites. Even a </p>        good old-fashioned search engine query for the company's name can turn </p>        up some interesting information. (Some of which could be fun or interesting </p>        tidbits or icebreakers to share with the interviewer if you get that far. </p>        Something like, &quot;Did you know that if you do a search for your company </p>        on google that the one of the first links that pop up is to an archive </p>        of Nazi memorabilia?&quot;). </p></p>      <h3>Sartorial Suggestions</h3></p>      <p>First, let me tell you that appearances matter very little </p>        in this business. I have seen absolutely zero correlation between how </p>        an individual looks or dresses and how they perform on the job. As such, </p>        I could really care less about how a person looks when they come to interview </p>        for a job. My suggestion would be this: Be yourself. If, however, you </p>        feel as an individual that you can help your chances to get a job by removing </p>        an earring or dressing a bit more conservatively, go for it. It is important </p>        to feel physically comfortable on your interview. But I would caution </p>        you however that over time, a person's true colors will show through anyway, </p>        so please be careful about how far you are willing to go to pull the wool </p>        over someone's eyes. </p></p>      <p>From an employer's perspective, we really don't care what </p>        you look like or how you dress as long as you don't smell or wear offensive </p>        clothing or something equally galling. One thing we will care about sometimes </p>        is that you choose to be a bit more professional (both in terms of your </p>        behavior and your sartorial choices) when you have a scheduled client </p>        meeting to attend. </p></p>      <p><strong>General note:</strong> no matter what, try not to look like a dork </p>        (try to avoid the perception that you've been living in a closet writing </p>        code by the fluorescent light of your monitor). No matter what your style, </p>        this is something most people can accomplish without too much effort.</p></p>      <h3>The grand entrance</h3></p>      <p>Get there 15 minutes early (no matter what). However, don't </p>        go inside that early. Sit in your car until you have about 5 minutes till </p>        your scheduled arrival. While in your car, relax a bit. Turn off the radio. </p>        Turn up the air conditioner or heater to get your body a comfortable temperature </p>        (hot and sweaty or cold and clammy hand shakes are unpleasant, to say </p>        the least). Then think about the things you want to make sure you communicate </p>        about yourself while in there. Also think about the things you want to </p>        make sure you ask or learn while there. When you think you are mentally </p>        ready, get out of the car, head inside and pretend you are now the president </p>        of the United States and that everyone is watching your every move. I </p>        say this because you will immediately start making impressions on people </p>        as soon as you walk in the door. Your future boss or co-worker may walk </p>        right past you while waiting in the lobby. Be prepared and aware of these </p>        things and realize that although no one may ever remember the first time </p>        you walked in the building but then again, they just might tell stories </p>        about it down the road (&quot;I remember the first time I saw him in the </p>        lobby, he was sweating profusely and chain smoking gauloises&quot;). </p>      </p></p>      <p>Pay attention to what is going on around you. Evaluate the </p>        &quot;mood&quot; or &quot;culture&quot; of the office and staff as much </p>        as you can. If you have time, ask where the restroom is so that you can </p>        walk around the building a little bit. This will likely enable you to </p>        see more and learn more than you would just sitting in a waiting area. </p>        It will also give you an opportunity to confirm your stellar appearance </p>        in the mirror, or correct any fashion faux pas you've overlooked. </p></p>      <h3>The handshake</h3></p>      <p>When you first meet the interviewer, say his or her name </p>        out loud &quot;Hi _____&quot; or &quot;Hi Mr./Ms _____&quot;. If they </p>        don't say your name or otherwise indicate that they know exactly who you </p>        are, make sure you say your first and last name to them. Make sure you </p>        extend a dry hand, not too aggressively, but firmly and purposefully. </p>        Look them in the eye and don't shake too long. (If you find yourself staring </p>        at their shoes, quickly recover by commenting on how much you like their </p>        taste, something like, &quot;Pick those up in Milan, did you?&quot;). </p>        Nevertheless, a handshake makes an impression, establishes a personal </p>        relationship and breaks the ice. Also, you may think I am crazy for saying </p>        this but, remember how the handshake went and what their technique was </p>        like and try to consider that for your departure handshake. That way, </p>        if the first one isn't too smooth (for any number of reasons) you have </p>        a better shot of making the departure shake effective. </p></p>      <h3>Small talk </h3></p>      <p>Finally, be prepared to have 1-3 minutes worth of chitchat </p>        ready because some people like to do that to help break the ice or it </p>        may take you a couple minutes to get wherever you are going in the office </p>        for the actual interview. It is nice to start talking right away about </p>        things that are easy to discuss rather than to be a quiet little follower </p>        on the way to some place in the office. Remember, since your interview </p>        started the minute you walk in the door, make the best use of your time </p>        and be prepared.</p></p>      <h3>Hard talk</h3></p>      <p>If you have a choice of seats at a table, do not choose </p>        a seat that will put you exactly opposite the interviewer. If you can </p>        sit next to or 90 degrees to the right or left, that is better. It's best </p>        not to feel as though you were in a police interrogation. Sit up in your </p>        seat, lean slightly towards the interviewer and pull out a paper and pen </p>        to take notes or to review notes you may have already made for yourself. </p>        Even if your interviewer says nothing worth writing down, scribble aimlessly </p>        in order to give the impression that a) you are attentive, and b) that </p>        your interviewer is worth paying attention to. It will also enable you </p>        to write down the names of anyone you meet so that you may address them </p>        specifically later.</p></p>      <p>Make sure you ask questions. This should be a two way street </p>        and if you aren't asking questions, you are either going to appear uninterested, </p>        too eager to satisfy or cast in some kind of negative light. Consider </p>        asking questions that you think no one else may have asked (for instance, </p>        &quot;In the event of a fire, would designers be rescued before developers?&quot;) </p>        Those are the types of things that stand out in someone's mind. </p></p>      <p>Don't harp on &quot;little&quot; things or formalities. </p>        These include &quot;What kind of computer will I get?&quot;, &quot;What </p>        are work hours?&quot; and &quot;What type of benefits do you offer&quot;. </p>        (You might ask, with dreamy enthusiasm, &quot;If hired, will I have access </p>        to my work station 24-hours a day?&quot;) Those answers will come once </p>        you've established that this company does the kind of work you want to </p>        be a part of. Plus, those kind of detail-heavy issues tend to drain energy </p>        from a conversation that should properly take place at a higher, more conceptual </p>        level. </p></p>      <p>Try not to ramble on with your answers and definitely avoid </p>        meaningless conversational detours designed to exhibit your worldy wisdom. </p>        But sometimes off-topic can be good (example: you find that you share </p>        a common interest with the interviewer like a hobby or favorite sports </p>        team) because it can help them remember you and become comfortable with </p>        you. If you find those opportunities, exploit them. All is fair in job </p>        interviewing but above all make sure you don't lie or mislead! </p></p>      <p>Always try to relate past experiences to this company or </p>        job and point out how you think those experiences uniquely prepared you </p>        for the position at hand. </p></p>      <h3>Listen for clues</h3></p><p>        Listen for the interviewer to say things like &quot;When you start...&quot; </p>        or &quot;You will find...&quot; or any other word choices or phrases that </p>        indicate he/she may already be thinking about you being in the picture </p>        down the road. Look for their demeanor to change during the interview. </p>        If things are going well, they will smile, laugh, relax a bit or do something </p>        else that makes you feel more comfortable. Also, note whether they choose </p>        to introduce you to other people while you are in the building. If they </p>        introduce you and how they introduce you will again force them to tip </p>        their hand a bit and give you further insight into their level of interest </p>        in you.</p></p>      <p>Try to leave with a need for either you or them to communicate </p>        further about something. You might describe some unique or successful </p>        thing that you've created or generated that might not be in your portfolio </p>        but would be of interest to your interviewer. This is an easy way to continue </p>        the communication cycle and keep yourself in the loop. </p></p>      <p>If the interviewer starts talking about wanting to achieve </p>        or do something new and you have done or achieved this already, then take </p>        the opportunity to describe it, build on what the person was saying a </p>        bit and try to get them pumped enough or interested enough that they want </p>        to see or read it later. </p></p>      <p>This could even be off-topic (example: making sure you send </p>        them directions to the best place in town to fly fish since you know he </p>        is a big fly fisherman) and should essentially be something that promotes </p>        a need for further dialog or meetings.</p></p>      <h3>Parting words</h3></p>      <p>Pay attention to how the interviewer wraps things up. Is </p>        it because you are out of time, did he/she seem enthused? Anything you </p>        can absorb here could be useful. Make sure you ask what the next steps </p>        are in their decision making process and don't be afraid to ask what their </p>        timeframe is for making a decision. Be careful how you word these questions </p>        as you don't want to appear desperate. You might subtly remind your interviewer </p>        that you are interviewing at another place as well, or you might tell </p>        them that another firm is interested in your services and is expecting </p>        a decision from you-which you've temporarily delayed because you're more </p>        interested in this job. </p></p>      <p>Have 1-2 things prepared for the exit chitchat. Make sure </p>        they are clearly things that are not interview-specific so that you can </p>        prevent the interview from taking place all the way to the door. It is </p>        really annoying to still be talking shop as you are walking someone to </p>        the door. Shoot for something more personal like briefly mentioning a </p>        current world or sporting event that you think this person could relate </p>        to. Say goodbye and express how much you enjoyed your visit. Extend the </p>        same courtesy to anyone else you have met and see again on the way out.</p></p>      <h3>After you have left</h3></p>      <p>Drive home with the radio off so that you can concentrate </p>        and review in your mind how things just went. Think about what you said. </p>        What grade would you give yourself? Are you more or less interested in </p>        the job/company now? As soon as you get home, either send an email or </p>        write a hand written note and mail it to the interviewer. Keep it short </p>        and simple and use this as an opportunity to thank them for their time </p>        and consideration and also to include any other information you may have </p>        told them you would follow up with or communicate later.</p></p>      <p>Finally, think about what you could have done better and </p>        how you will use that knowledge to be more prepared either the next time </p>        you go back or the next time you interview somewhere else.</p></p>      <p>I am hopeful that this will be of some use. Most of </p>        these comments are based on my experiences as both an interviewee and </p>        an interviewer in the web design and development industry. However, some </p>        of these comments clearly will carry over into just about any other field. </p>        If you remember something from this article and use it to your benefit </p>        in an interview, I would love to hear about it.
