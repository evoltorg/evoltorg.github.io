Evolt.org is happy to announce that we will begin distributing the source code that runs the evolt.org site free for download and under the GPL license.  <P></p>Before we give it to the masses, I'd like to ask if there are any CF developers out there that would like to get a sneak peak at the source by helping with documentation, bug fixing, etc. Nothing serious, just a once over from other people that develop CF. <P></p>After this short process is finished, we'll begin offering the source to the masses of fanatic groupies out there that have been lusting after it since inception... <P></p>To those of you are that interested, please <a href="mailto:djc@members.evolt.org?subject=evolt%20source">drop me a line</a>! Thanks! <P>
