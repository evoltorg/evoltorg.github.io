Despite existing examples of brand-building and effective Web-based promotion of  physical shops by many companies, online research company APT Strategies has reported  that Australia's top 100 brands have no Internet presence. <P> While the number of Australians buying online numbered only 650 000 last year, this  is a significant increase over previous years, and this growth should be of interest  to every company. <a href="http://www.newswire.com.au">Newswire</a> notes APT  Strategies brands manager, Mitch O'Brien, as saying "A strong approach to online  branding will bolster more online and offline sales". <P> Rather than jump into ecommerce when they may not have a perfectly suitable product,  <a href="http://www.aptstrategies.com.au/">APT Strategies</a> encourages offline  companies to instead think of the Internet as a promotional tool, and consider an  online database of customers - email is a cheap and quick way of maintaining contact  with these clients, and a Web site is a cost-effective method of promoting special  deals, etc, also. <P> Currently, fresh and popular online brands such as E*Trade, ChaosMusic and various  travel sites, are dominating online, and even though they may not be as large as  offline companies, brands not taking advantage of the Internet are losing valuable  ground. <P> The original Newswire article on APT's report can be found <a  href="http://www.newswire.com.au/9909/topaus.htm">here</a>. <P> <P>
