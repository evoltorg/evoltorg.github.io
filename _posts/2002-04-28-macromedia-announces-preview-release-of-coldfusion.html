<p>\nMacromedia announced today that it would release a �preview release� of its next generation application server ColdFusion MX, formerly code named Neo.  The preview release is intended to give the public a look at the product, and is not the same version beta testers are using.  ColdFusion MX is expected to ship in June 2002.\n</p>\n<p>\nColdFusion MX was written in Java and runs on top of a J2EE server.  Macromedia announced that the server would run on top of IBM WebSphere, BEA WebLogic, Sun ONE Application Server and Macromedia�s own J2EE server JRun.  \n</p>\n<p>\nColdFusion MX is nearly 100% backwards compatible with ColdFusion 5 code, and also introduces several new features including tools for creating and invoking Web Services, a security overhaul, support for JSP custom tags within CFML pages, JSP, Servlets, XML Parser, Xpath, XSL, and perhaps the most intriguing new feature ColdFusion Components, or CFC�s.  CFC�s allow a developer to easily encapsulate logic with a quasi object oriented approach.  ColdFusion components can be deployed as Web Services with very little effort.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2002/coldfusion_mx_announce.html" title="\nColdFusion MX Press Release" target="_blank">ColdFusion MX Press Release</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/cfmxdl/" title="Download Preview Release" target="_blank">Download Preview Release</a>\n</p>
