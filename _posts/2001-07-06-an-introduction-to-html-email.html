<h2>Pop-quiz hotshot!</h2></p><p><p>You've got to send an HTML email to a list of clients</p>and have it display correctly across a spectrum of email clients</p>which include Outlook, web-based, frame-based. It has to be Netscape</p>compatible, Eudora-friendly, Lotus Notes accessible...</p></p><p><h2>What do you do?*</h2></p><p><p><em>[Author's note:</p>If you could say &quot;What do you do?&quot; a second time in your</p>head in your best &quot;Dennis Hopper Voice&quot;&#153;, it would</p>really help us out.]</em></p></p><p><p>So, you want to send HTML email to your clients, prospects</p>or newsletter subscribers? Marketing has descended from upon high</p>and declared it, the small business client wants it, an executive</p>in management has read about it.</p></p><p><p>Well, why not? The click-through rates are noticeably</p>higher on HTML email. Analysis shows  that customers are less likely</p>to unsubscribe from HTML email than their text counterparts. In</p>my last <a href="http://www.florentinedesign.com/email_tk/tk_01.htm" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">TemplateKit</p>email newsletter</a>, I had 11 unsubscribes, 10 of which were text</p>recipients. Customers simply respond with more click-throughs, more</p>sales, more inquiries for information, if your message is in a form</p>that the recipient can easily view and display correctly.</p></p><p><p>The fact of the matter is that email HTML browsers are</p>just not equal to their web browser equivalents. This is further</p>complicated by the wide variety of settings, preferences, security</p>updates, versions, and third-party applications which make the user</p>experience hard to predict.</p></p><p><p>Recently I've seen:</p></p><p><ul></p><li>Clients try to send &lt;Forms&gt; via email which terminated</p>in a web-based email reader.</li></p><li>Style sheets which conflict with web-based email systems <em>(sense</p>a pattern here?)</em></li></p><li>Redirects which get processed twice and break.</li></p><li>A Flash or Shockwave piece that begins streaming in an Outlook</p>preview window and then starts a second time when the email is</p>opened. </li></p><li>Entire JavaScripts blown apart when a viewer's security settings</p>or a web-based email client forbids it.</li></p></ul></p><p><p>And these are just a few of my favorite occurrences.</p></p><p><p>We can start with Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express to see</p>how each will render HTML.</p></p><p><p>Outlook decides whether to use the full version of IE (depending</p>on the version you may have) or use a &quot;lite&quot; version,</p>depending on your current configuration.</p></p><p><p>Two links which can help you understand these differences are:</p></p><p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q262/7/01.asp" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">Outlook</p>E-mail Security Update Information</a></p></p><p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q249/9/72.asp" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">How</p>Outlook Renders HTML</a></p></p><p><h2>When entering your content, be aware of potential problems</h2></p><p><p>There are a number of different ways for</p>you to send HTML code to your viewers.</p></p><p><ol></p><li>As an attachment.</li></p><li>As an embedded document.</li></p><li>As Raw HTML (consult your individual email program) </li></p><li>Through a third-party application</li></p></ol></p><p><p>When you enter HTML into your application, be aware whenever you</p>do the following:</p></p><p><ul></p><li> Cutting and pasting from WebPages.</li></p><li>Cutting and pasting from a MS Office product.</li></p><li>Using a previously mailed document as the basis for your code.</li></p></ul></p><p><h2>Cutting and Pasting from a Web page</h2></p><p><p>There are several ways to get HTML code from an existing document</p>without using an HTML editor.</p></p><p><p>You can &quot;view source&quot; and copy the code to the clipboard;</p>create a copy with the &quot;save as&quot; command; or you can try</p>to select the code from the body of the document and paste it into</p>another program.</p></p><p><p>Notice how links inside that document are set up. If your document</p>contains a number of relative links, (i.e. /images/yourimage.gif),</p>then you might not be able to find your images when it is time to</p>preview and test.</p></p><p><p>You may want to include a &lt;BASE&gt; tag in your HTML email so</p>your recipient's browser knows how to interpret document relative</p>links.</p></p><p><p>The BASE element allows global reference information to be set.</p>Use of the HREF attribute provides a base address for interpreting</p>all relative URL references in a document when the document is read</p>out of context. The TARGET attribute specifies a global frame destination</p>name to be used for page activation changes (in links, forms and</p>image maps.) </p></p><p><p><strong>Example:</strong><br></p><p><code>&lt;BASE HREF=&quot;http://www.florentinedesign.com&quot; TARGET=&quot;_top&quot;&gt; </code></p></p></p><p><p>This may help your mailings, however we would recommend an absolute</p>URL for each of your links.</p></p><p><h2>Cutting and Pasting from a Microsoft Office Product</h2></p><p><p>If you cut and paste from Microsoft Word, there is always the possibility</p>that some formatting will not carry over into HTML very well. This</p>is most often seen in the case of Auto formatting, when MS Word</p>converts common keystrokes into symbols. -, &quot;&quot;, &copy;, and a host of others. These are called Windows Characters, and</p>they are not interpreted by your web browser.</p></p><p><p>Word represents these ASCII characters as numeric values which a</p>browser cannot understand.</p></p><p><p>This is why it is best to always work in text mode, or save your</p>document as a dos text document and lose all formatting before transferring</p>it to your HTML email.</p></p><p><p>An excellent Text Editor to use is <a href="http://www.textpad.com/" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">TextPad</a>,</p>which allows you to specify which code set you should use and</p>save your document as. Be aware that merely pasting your code into</p><a href="http://www.textpad.com/" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">TextPad </a>or</p>saving your document in MS Word as a text document is not good enough.</p></p><p><h2>Using a Previously Mailed Document as the Basis for your code.</h2></p><p><p>You may experience problems whenever you try to use code, which</p>has already been mailed, as the basis for your new mailing. This</p>is most often seen with code that has been rendered through a web-based</p>browser which you wish to use again. Many web-based email clients</p>and image hosting companies, such as Netscape NetMail or Akamai,</p>have their own redirection and accounting which break your links</p>if you try to send them a link which has already been processed</p>by their system before.</p></p><p><p>Simply put, do not try to redirect a redirect. This is true for</p>your own redirects as well.</p></p><p><p>Since these systems assign these redirects to any HTML link that</p>it can discover, it is often better to avoid using &quot;named anchors&quot;</p>as well. A named anchor, or &quot;jump anchor&quot; is a link which</p>takes you to another spot in the same document. </p></p><p><p><code><a name="foo"></a>&lt;A Name=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;</code></p></p><p><p>If a redirect gets placed on a named anchor, it will most likely</p>either break or spawn a new browser window with unpredictable results.</p>From a marketing standpoint, if your email is so long that you feel</p>you need to use named anchors, maybe you should consider editing.</p></p><p></p><p>That's it for some of the basics. Stay tuned for next week's continuation of this article, where we'll discuss stripping out unnecessary HTML elements and responsible uses of JavaScript in HTML formatted email.</p>
