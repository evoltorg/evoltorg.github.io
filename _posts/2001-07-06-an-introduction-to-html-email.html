<h2>Pop-quiz hotshot!</h2></p><p><p>You've got to send an HTML email to a list of clients\nand have it display correctly across a spectrum of email clients\nwhich include Outlook, web-based, frame-based. It has to be Netscape\ncompatible, Eudora-friendly, Lotus Notes accessible...</p></p><p><h2>What do you do?*</h2></p><p><p><em>[Author's note:\nIf you could say &quot;What do you do?&quot; a second time in your\nhead in your best &quot;Dennis Hopper Voice&quot;&#153;, it would\nreally help us out.]</em></p></p><p><p>So, you want to send HTML email to your clients, prospects\nor newsletter subscribers? Marketing has descended from upon high\nand declared it, the small business client wants it, an executive\nin management has read about it.</p></p><p><p>Well, why not? The click-through rates are noticeably\nhigher on HTML email. Analysis shows  that customers are less likely\nto unsubscribe from HTML email than their text counterparts. In\nmy last <a href="http://www.florentinedesign.com/email_tk/tk_01.htm" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">TemplateKit\nemail newsletter</a>, I had 11 unsubscribes, 10 of which were text\nrecipients. Customers simply respond with more click-throughs, more\nsales, more inquiries for information, if your message is in a form\nthat the recipient can easily view and display correctly.</p></p><p><p>The fact of the matter is that email HTML browsers are\njust not equal to their web browser equivalents. This is further\ncomplicated by the wide variety of settings, preferences, security\nupdates, versions, and third-party applications which make the user\nexperience hard to predict.</p></p><p><p>Recently I've seen:</p></p><p><ul>\n<li>Clients try to send &lt;Forms&gt; via email which terminated\nin a web-based email reader.</li>\n<li>Style sheets which conflict with web-based email systems <em>(sense\na pattern here?)</em></li>\n<li>Redirects which get processed twice and break.</li>\n<li>A Flash or Shockwave piece that begins streaming in an Outlook\npreview window and then starts a second time when the email is\nopened. </li>\n<li>Entire JavaScripts blown apart when a viewer's security settings\nor a web-based email client forbids it.</li>\n</ul></p><p><p>And these are just a few of my favorite occurrences.</p></p><p><p>We can start with Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express to see\nhow each will render HTML.</p></p><p><p>Outlook decides whether to use the full version of IE (depending\non the version you may have) or use a &quot;lite&quot; version,\ndepending on your current configuration.</p></p><p><p>Two links which can help you understand these differences are:</p></p><p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q262/7/01.asp" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">Outlook\nE-mail Security Update Information</a></p></p><p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q249/9/72.asp" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">How\nOutlook Renders HTML</a></p></p><p><h2>When entering your content, be aware of potential problems</h2></p><p><p>There are a number of different ways for\nyou to send HTML code to your viewers.</p></p><p><ol>\n<li>As an attachment.</li>\n<li>As an embedded document.</li>\n<li>As Raw HTML (consult your individual email program) </li>\n<li>Through a third-party application</li>\n</ol></p><p><p>When you enter HTML into your application, be aware whenever you\ndo the following:</p></p><p><ul>\n<li> Cutting and pasting from WebPages.</li>\n<li>Cutting and pasting from a MS Office product.</li>\n<li>Using a previously mailed document as the basis for your code.</li>\n</ul></p><p><h2>Cutting and Pasting from a Web page</h2></p><p><p>There are several ways to get HTML code from an existing document\nwithout using an HTML editor.</p></p><p><p>You can &quot;view source&quot; and copy the code to the clipboard;\ncreate a copy with the &quot;save as&quot; command; or you can try\nto select the code from the body of the document and paste it into\nanother program.</p></p><p><p>Notice how links inside that document are set up. If your document\ncontains a number of relative links, (i.e. /images/yourimage.gif),\nthen you might not be able to find your images when it is time to\npreview and test.</p></p><p><p>You may want to include a &lt;BASE&gt; tag in your HTML email so\nyour recipient's browser knows how to interpret document relative\nlinks.</p></p><p><p>The BASE element allows global reference information to be set.\nUse of the HREF attribute provides a base address for interpreting\nall relative URL references in a document when the document is read\nout of context. The TARGET attribute specifies a global frame destination\nname to be used for page activation changes (in links, forms and\nimage maps.) </p></p><p><p><strong>Example:</strong><br></p><p><code>&lt;BASE HREF=&quot;http://www.florentinedesign.com&quot; TARGET=&quot;_top&quot;&gt; </code>\n</p></p><p><p>This may help your mailings, however we would recommend an absolute\nURL for each of your links.</p></p><p><h2>Cutting and Pasting from a Microsoft Office Product</h2></p><p><p>If you cut and paste from Microsoft Word, there is always the possibility\nthat some formatting will not carry over into HTML very well. This\nis most often seen in the case of Auto formatting, when MS Word\nconverts common keystrokes into symbols. -, &quot;&quot;, &copy;, and a host of others. These are called Windows Characters, and\nthey are not interpreted by your web browser.</p></p><p><p>Word represents these ASCII characters as numeric values which a\nbrowser cannot understand.</p></p><p><p>This is why it is best to always work in text mode, or save your\ndocument as a dos text document and lose all formatting before transferring\nit to your HTML email.</p></p><p><p>An excellent Text Editor to use is <a href="http://www.textpad.com/" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">TextPad</a>,\nwhich allows you to specify which code set you should use and\nsave your document as. Be aware that merely pasting your code into\n<a href="http://www.textpad.com/" target="_new" title="Link Opens in New Window">TextPad </a>or\nsaving your document in MS Word as a text document is not good enough.</p></p><p><h2>Using a Previously Mailed Document as the Basis for your code.</h2></p><p><p>You may experience problems whenever you try to use code, which\nhas already been mailed, as the basis for your new mailing. This\nis most often seen with code that has been rendered through a web-based\nbrowser which you wish to use again. Many web-based email clients\nand image hosting companies, such as Netscape NetMail or Akamai,\nhave their own redirection and accounting which break your links\nif you try to send them a link which has already been processed\nby their system before.</p></p><p><p>Simply put, do not try to redirect a redirect. This is true for\nyour own redirects as well.</p></p><p><p>Since these systems assign these redirects to any HTML link that\nit can discover, it is often better to avoid using &quot;named anchors&quot;\nas well. A named anchor, or &quot;jump anchor&quot; is a link which\ntakes you to another spot in the same document. </p></p><p><p><code><a name="foo"></a>&lt;A Name=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;</code></p></p><p><p>If a redirect gets placed on a named anchor, it will most likely\neither break or spawn a new browser window with unpredictable results.\nFrom a marketing standpoint, if your email is so long that you feel\nyou need to use named anchors, maybe you should consider editing.</p></p><p>\n<p>That's it for some of the basics. Stay tuned for next week's continuation of this article, where we'll discuss stripping out unnecessary HTML elements and responsible uses of JavaScript in HTML formatted email.</p>
