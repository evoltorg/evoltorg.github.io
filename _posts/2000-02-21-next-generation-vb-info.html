<P>Microsoft <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/nextgen/language.asp">has released</a> some details about the next generation 'Programmable Web Language Innovations' - basically the set of new features that they'll be adding to future releases of VB.\n</P>\n<P>\nWith features like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, its obvious they want to move in an object orientated direction. To me, it sounds a lot like their next new answer to counter the growing popularity of Java.\n</P>
