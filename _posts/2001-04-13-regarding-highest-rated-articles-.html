Article with the same rating should be sorted by how many people have rated them.  For example, the following is what I see right now on the sidebar under "Highest Rated Articles":</p><ul></p><li>Some Caveats with Us�<br></p>4.88 after 8 ratings </li></p><li>Evolt.org offers fre�<br></p>4.88 after 26 ratings </li></p><li>The Tao of Testing<br></p>4.88 after 8 ratings </li></p><li>Flash Interface Usab�<br></p>4.86 after 7 ratings </li></p><li>Liquid Tables<br></p>4.83 after 6 ratings </li></p></ul></p>This should look like this:</p><ul></p><li>Evolt.org offers fre�<br></p>4.88 after 26 ratings </li></p><li>Some Caveats with Us�<br></p>4.88 after 8 ratings </li></p><li>The Tao of Testing<br></p>4.88 after 8 ratings </li></p><li>Liquid Tables<br></p>4.83 after 6 ratings </li></p></ul></p><br></p>A high rating doesn't mean anything if only one person rated it (I am exagerating there, but you get the idea).  It's not a big deal, but it would be more organized and makes more sense than the way it is now.
