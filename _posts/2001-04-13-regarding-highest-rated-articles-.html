Article with the same rating should be sorted by how many people have rated them.  For example, the following is what I see right now on the sidebar under "Highest Rated Articles":\n<ul>\n<li>Some Caveats with Us�<br>\n4.88 after 8 ratings </li>\n<li>Evolt.org offers fre�<br>\n4.88 after 26 ratings </li>\n<li>The Tao of Testing<br>\n4.88 after 8 ratings </li>\n<li>Flash Interface Usab�<br>\n4.86 after 7 ratings </li>\n<li>Liquid Tables<br>\n4.83 after 6 ratings </li>\n</ul>\nThis should look like this:\n<ul>\n<li>Evolt.org offers fre�<br>\n4.88 after 26 ratings </li>\n<li>Some Caveats with Us�<br>\n4.88 after 8 ratings </li>\n<li>The Tao of Testing<br>\n4.88 after 8 ratings </li>\n<li>Liquid Tables<br>\n4.83 after 6 ratings </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nA high rating doesn't mean anything if only one person rated it (I am exagerating there, but you get the idea).  It's not a big deal, but it would be more organized and makes more sense than the way it is now.
