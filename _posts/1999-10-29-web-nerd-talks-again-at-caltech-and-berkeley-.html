<p></p><b>More Seminars from Philip Greenspun:</b><br></p>Re-posted with his permission.</p></p></p><p></p>If you liked my previous talk(s), you might want to come to a new,</p>more technical one-day course.  It will be held at Caltech on</p>November 14.  See <a href="http://photo.net/teaching/one-day-tools.html">http://photo.net/teaching/one-day-tools.html</a></p>for details.  The class is free and when you're finished you'll</p>be able to easily build something like amazon.com, ebay, or </p>photo.net in a matter of days with open-source tools.</p></p></p><p></p>If you liked my previous one-day talk and think a friend or</p>colleague would be interested, please tell them that the course</p>will be repeated on November 13 at Caltech and November 20 at</p>University of California Berkeley.  They can register at </p><a href="http://register.photo.net">http://register.photo.net</a> </p></p></p><p></p>The ArsDigita Community System that you saw demonstrated at the </p>previous courses is getting steadily better.  It is being pushed</p>forward partly by our students (at five universities now) but </p>also by ArsDigita.com, which is up to $12 million in sales and </p>40 developers (proving that one need not be smart or lucky to </p>succeed in the Internet business).  See</p><a href="http://photo.net/doc/version-history.html">http://photo.net/doc/version-history.html</a> to keep up with the </p>improvements.</p></p></p><p></p>Finally, if you know any 18-year-old kids or younger, please </p>tell them to get ready to apply for the ArsDigita Prize (they </p>can check <a href="http://arsdigita.org">http://arsdigita.org</a> for details but the bottom line</p>is that they get $10,000 and a trip to MIT if they build a </p>tasteful non-commercial Web service).</p></p></p>
