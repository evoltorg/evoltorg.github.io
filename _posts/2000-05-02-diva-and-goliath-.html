<P>After Microsoft ignored a cease </p>and desist letter sent on April 25, 2000, the Digital Divas </p>(<a href="http://www.digitaldivas.com">www.digitaldivas.com</a>) have launched a massive internet </p>campaign known as "Diva and Goliath" to stop Microsoft's </p>continued infringement on their trademark.  The Digital Divas </p>discovered in April that Microsoft launched a promotion known </p>as the Microsoft Digital Diva (<a href="http://www.digitaldiva.com">www.digitaldiva.com</a>), employing </p>a woman who appears to offer help to consumers with computer </p>and the internet use.  According to Digital Divas founder Dana </p>Whitmire (<a href="http://www.danas.net">www.danas.net</a>), "these are exactly the types of </p>services our group has offered to the internet community for </p>almost three years.  We feel Microsoft has tried to capitalize </p>on the good will we have worked hard to build." </p></P></p><P></p>The Digital Divas were founded by Whitmire in 1997.  They </p>provide computer and internet assistance from their website and </p>promote the services of their members, all of whom are </p>experienced and successful computer professionals.  The group </p>is composed of 71 members from 17 U.S. states and 7 foreign </p>countries.  The purpose of the Diva and Goliath campaign is </p>threefold.  According to spokesperson Faith A. Kaminsky, "our </p>small group has limited resources.  We are hoping that the </p>campaign will get the internet community behind us, help us </p>raise some money to commence a lawsuit, and hopefully attract a </p>lawyer to assist us."  The Digital Divas are the founders of </p>Grey Day (www.greyday.org), an annual copyright awareness event </p>that began on October 1, 1998.  Many of the members, including </p>Timmi Sommer feel that Microsoft's actions "are particularly a </p>slap in the face" for that reason.</p></P></p><P></p>The cease and desist letter sent to Microsoft was written by </p>the New York law firm Moses & Singer (www.mosessinger.com) on a </p>pro bono basis.  According to Kaminsky, "we are extremely </p>grateful for the assistance of David Rabinowitz and Mark </p>Marderosian, but we understand that it is a big task for any </p>lawfirm to accept on a pro bono basis."</p></P></p><P></p>Complete information about the Diva and Goliath campaign can be </p>found at <a href="http://www.digitaldivas.com/gol">www.digitaldivas.com/gol/</a></p></P>
