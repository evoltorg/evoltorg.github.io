user_biog: "<p><a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> is a Jedi Master in the art of creating sites and keeping servers running. This often means hitting them repeatedly with forces that defy rational explanation, though he prefers to descibe it as \"administration\". When he\'s not practising his percussive skills on E450s and AS400s, he can be found masquerading as the senior developer for some <a href=\"http://www.getfrank.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"My current employer\'s website\">widely varied clients</a>. It\'s still not certain whether or not the meanings of CMS, CRM, and B2B have penetrated the alcoholic fog enveloping his brain, but he makes convincing noises to customers about XML, XSLT, Python, J2EE, PHP, Perl, C++, and OpenGL.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> has been in the web game pretty much since it began, and still has fond memories of the time when a web could be swept aside with a duster and spam was pork luncheon meat. Despite being the developer of one of the first commerce sites in Europe, he has yet to make any real money.</p>
<p>Being English, <a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> doesn\'t like SOAP, but instead has recently discovered something called <a href=\"http://www.zope.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Zope website\">ZOPE</a>. Zope is a platform that runs <a href=\"http://plone.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Plone. It\'s cool.\">Plone</a> which he thinks is the coolest thing since <a href=\"http://www.opengl.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OpenGL site\">high-performance, real-time 3D APIs</a>, which he often writes small games in.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> lives in <a href=\"http://www.brighton.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Brighton\">the best little city in the world</a>, and used to commute 5 hours a day on British trains. He is subsequently immune to all forms of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=monty+python+spanish+inquisition\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nobody expects this\">torture techniques</a>.</p>"

America's top "dot com" companies, including Inktomi, Lycos, AOL, Yahoo and eBay, announced today that they have formed a coalition to further promote their interests to the US governement.<p></p>"In founding <a href="http://www.netcoalition.com" target="_blank">NetCoalition.com</a> these leading entrepreneurs are responding to members of Congress who tell us they need innovative online approaches to the unique challenges facing the Internet," said Daniel Ebert who will be coordinating the coalition's Washington operations.<p></p>It's estimated that 90% of web users visit a site owned by one of the nine companies every month, so the new coalition looks set to be able to swing a lot of weight.<p></p>The original report is available from <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/tc/story.html?s=v/nm/19990712/tc/tech_coalition_2.html" target="_blank">Yahoo!
