<p>
    <a href="/"><strong>evolt.org</strong></a>, the web development community, is now 
    <a href="https://lists.evolt.org/archive/Week-of-Mon-20240101/132688.html">closed</a>. 
    It was founded in 1998, and ran until 2024. Thank you to everyone who made it possible.
</p>
<p>
    You can still read our community's <a href="/archive.html">articles</a> 
    and our <a href="https://lists.evolt.org">mailing list archives</a>, 
    and the <a href="https://browsers.evolt.org">browser archive</a> is still
    open for business.
