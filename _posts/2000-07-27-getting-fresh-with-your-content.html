<p>Dan said we need a new article on our front page. So, I'm here to talk about the </p>importance of having fresh content.</p></p><p>It's a well known fact that visitors to a website enjoy </p>seeing new content on a somewhat regular basis. </p>Many of the most popular sites on the Web are the </p>ones that have the most frequently updated content.  Sites like </p><a href="http://slashdot.org" target="_new">/.</a>, </p><a href="http://www.metafilter.com" target="_new">Metafilter</a>, and at times, </p><a href="http://evolt.org">yours truly</a>.  </p>These dog days of summer (in the northern hemisphere at least) are well known </p>for generating little news, happenings, events, or things to talk about in general.</p></p></p><p>So what's a site to do? You want to keep users coming back, </p>interested, and happy - but it's a difficult task when there's not a </p>whole lot going on!  Fear not, gentle reader.  Me and my friends have some </p>hints that might help you pull through these slow times:</p></p><ol></p><li><p>You can write parodies </p>(<a href="http://www.microsith.com/index.php3" target="_new">1</a>, </p><a href="http://www.vestige.org/idiotbox.html" target="_new">2</a>). It's a nice way </p>to escape the doldrums of everyday life, and reminds your faithful </p>audience that you still have a sense of humor.</p></li></p><li><p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/25" target="_new">Claim to have invented</a> </p>something really cool, useful, revolutionary, and <i>excellent!!</i> </p>Then hype it up to the ends of the earth. Ignore the fact that there are </p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/downloads/1,10150,0-10000-103-0-1-7,00.html?tag=st%2Edl%2E10004%2Esbsr&qt=radio+station&cn=&ca=10000" target="_new">hundreds</a> of </p>other applications out there that have more features, are more powerful, </p>and are currently being used by tens of thousands of people. </p>If anyone <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19072" target="_new">questions your claim</a> to </p>greatness, shrug off the question and spin an answer. Of course, there is </p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/default.asp" target="_new">more than one way</a> </p>to put this into practice.</p></li></p><li><p>"<a href="http://www.webstandards.org/" target="_new">Blast</a>" a large, tightly bonded community. This is a sure fire way to get attention from the group you're blasting in the form of links, flames, and more links to your site. </p>It's also a great way to generate <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-334946.html" target="_new">media hype</a> about your site!</p></li></p><li><p>Finally, if all else fails, simply  </p><a href="http://www.webmonkey.com" target="_new">let your site rot</a>. </p>Oddly enough, this will also generate interest in your site when your </p><a href="http://evolt.org/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=1612">once faithful members start wondering</a> </p>what is going on and asking questions.</p></ol></p><p>Of course, this is only a short list of the numerous options </p>that you have to generate content for your site and keep your viewers happy. </p>Hopefully you find some relief from these sultry summer months while you </p>and your content keep - and stay - fresh!</p>
