<h2>Many Hats, One Head?</h2></p><p><p>If you're like me, the terms Web Designer and Web Developer hardly describe the actual </p>day-to-day work you do.  I'm currently employed at a large hospital with the title of Lead </p>Web Developer.  Do I lead?  Umm-hmm.  Do I do "Web" work?  Yep.  Am I a </p>developer?  Sometimes.  Does the title Lead Web Developer describe my job?  Not </p>really.<p></p><p><p>I work on a very small team. There are only five of us.  The organization is fairly large, </p>but it is nothing to the amount of information it produces, archives and links to.  Trust </p>me, it's a lot.  The five of us, brave souls all, are the sole conduit getting that information </p>out via web technologies, whether it's to an internal audience via our intranet or external </p>via front facing Web site.  Not only are we responsible for the dissemination of </p>information, we provide services and applications as well.  It's a lot of work, but quite </p>enjoyable most of the time.</p></p><p><p>Does this sound familiar?  Well if it does, and you're working as a Web Developer or </p>Designer, I'm sure you, like myself, have needed to wear many different hats in order to </p>get your job done.  I'd bet some of you have been writers, marketers, editors, DBAs, </p>usability engineers, project managers.  The list goes on, right?  Well, one thing I'm sure </p>anyone who has to deal with a large organization or large amount of information has had </p>to delve into is information architecture.  And, I'm sure that some of you didn't even </p>know you were doing it at the time.</p></p><p><p>The purpose of this article is to help you define information architecture so that you can </p>recognize when it is you are wearing an IA hat, as well as provide you some tips, basics </p>and resources to help you build the most well-architected sites possible.  So let's get </p>started.</p></p><p><h2>What is Information Architecture and why should I care?</h2></p><p><p>There are many <a href="http://www.atl.ualberta.ca/downes/threads/mm1.htm">different ideas</a> as to what information architecture is and what an information architect does.  I've come up with my own definition for the </p>purposes of this article.   Here goes:  Information Architecture is the process of creating </p>as structure for a body of information or content.  In our case, this structure is specific to </p>the production of a web site.  It is the foundation upon which a sites user interface is laid </p>upon, and the mold that a site's content is laid in. </p> </p><p><p>To go with a more traditional metaphor, it is the blueprint from which a web site is built, </p>or at least it starts there.  If you were building your own home, before you started pouring </p>concrete and buying 2x4s you would have an "architect" layout the plans for your house. </p>It is much the same with IA � you need a good plan, a good blueprint, before you start to </p>build your images and work up your CSS.</p></p><p><p>Don't get me wrong; user interface and content design go hand in hand with IA.  The </p>goals of the site, and the expectations of the user need to be in the mind of whoever is </p>working on the IA from the start, as wall as keeping the IA in mind until the end.</p></p><p><p>If you take the time to structure the content and information of your site, before you jump </p>into design or development, you will have a much easier time when it comes to working </p>on your user interface and navigation.  Your readers and users will also benefit from a </p>good, well thought out IA.  They will be able to find things easier on a site that is </p>structured to fit their needs, they will spend less time looking and more time reading and </p>using your site.</p></p><p><h2>Nice.  What now?</h2></p><p><p>Now that you have a bit of an understanding of what information architecture is and how </p>putting some time into getting your IA right can help you out, lets get into some specifics. </p> </p><p><p>Quite a bit of IA is just common sense.  It fairly obvious that if we are grouping items by </p>color, for instance, and orange would go in the "orange" group.  Some IAs will be </p>almost that simple, and everything will seem to fall into place.  If you are dealing with a </p>large amount of information, or information that might lend itself to ambiguity, that is </p>when you need to really work on how you structure that information. </p> </p><p><p>The first thing you want to do is take time to understand your users, and the goals of your </p>site or project.  It might sound like a no brainer - but I assure you that it's overlooked </p>fairly often and can mean disaster for your project if not done right.  It's vital </p>that everyone on the team understands the goals of the project.  This means the </p>organization's goals, but more importantly this means the goals of your users.  Don't just </p>ask yourself how people are going to view, access, read and use your site.  Ask them.</p></p><p><p>Do some research, ask questions and interview users � get to know your audience(s).  If </p>you are doing a redesign make sure you get information on how people are currently </p>using your site, what do they like, dislike and expect.  Find out what isn't working.  </p>There are many ways to connect with your users and you should do whatever it takes to </p>do so.  Do use cases and task analysis; conduct a usability test or survey.  Here is <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/computing/webbuilding/studio/feature19980729-</p>2.html">an </p>article</a>  to help you get started.</p></p><p><p>Once you have your research done and your information gathered, start on a plan for your </p>project, try to keep your users in mind at all times.  Try to envision how your team is </p>going to meet their goals and when in doubt, go back and ask the users for more </p>information.</p></p><p><p>Next, do a content inventory.  You need to sit down and go through all the content you </p>have available to you for your site.  You might have some content already in Web form, </p>for instance if you are doing a redesign, or it might be Word documents or even paper.  </p>The point here is to gather it all together so you can begin to sort it out for your site. </p> </p><p><p>Get to know your content, read it, work with it, and love it.  Knowing your content </p>intimately will greatly help your job.  Make sure you interact with the content owners if </p>possible, I realize this can be like herding cats, but the more you work with them the </p>easier this will be.  Try to concentrate on getting content that is closest to Web form, </p>ideally you would have content specific for your site, but that isn't often the case.</p>  </p><p><p>Next take all that yummy content you've gathered and start to organize it.  Break it up </p>into groups, combine redundancies, and throw out any repeated and useless content.  If </p>you have something that doesn't seem to be "Web" enough, think about ways that can be </p>re-worked or eliminated. I can't stress enough how having good "Web" content will help </p>the success of your site, not only with it's organization, but in many other ways as well.  </p>There are many ways you can improve the content on your site, a good place to start is </p>getting your content owners to concentrate on writing for the Web.  If you want to learn </p>more about good Web writing, or want to direct others in your organization to some </p>resources, there is quite a bit of good stuff out there.  <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/writing/"> You can start here.</a></p> </p><p><p>If you are using links to other sites as content, see where you might either link within </p>your own site or create content within your organization to replace those links.  It will </p>make your site more useful to your users, give your site more credibility, and well it'll be </p>easier to maintain.</p></p><p><p>Once your content is gathered, you will then need to decide how to organize your </p>content, this can vary greatly depending on the type of content you are working with.  </p>This can be very tricky, as semantics and politics will mostly likely rear their ugly heads </p>here.  A good thing to remember is that you are just sorting and grouping the content </p>right now, not labeling it and not applying a user interface.  Those things are for later.  </p>Right now you just need to organize, organize, organize.</p></p><p><p>There are two main components to organizing your content.  Scheme and structure.</p></p><p><p>The scheme defines the grouping of your content; here you decide what fits together. </p>There are many ways to group your content, and you will need to find what works best </p>for your site. You could group your content alphabetically for instance, or by your target </p>audiences.  The more exact your organization, the easier it will be.  Chances are you will </p>use a combination of organization schemes.  The key here is to keep these different </p>schemes separate when moving to design as to avoid user confusion.</p> </p><p><p>The structure of your content defines how items and groups relate to each other.  As with </p>your content scheme, this can be done quite a few different ways.  You can go with a top-</p>down approach, in which you will group your content in a way that users will use a drill </p>down method to get to deep content, or, you can go with a more inter-relational approach </p>using links to tie like content together.  Again, chances are you will use a combination of </p>these structures for your site.</p></p><p><p>The main thing here is to keep your overall site organization in mind as you group your </p>content.  Relate that to your goals and try to keep in mind how people will use the site.  </p>You don't need to worry about getting this perfect, if you understand your users and do a </p>good content inventory your site will become better organized just by the process of </p>doing these exercises and getting to know your site better.  Not to mention, it's the Web, </p>you can always improve it later.</p> </p><p><p>No you can begin defining that content and adding labels and Meta data to it.  This can be </p>tricky, do your best not to let semantics get in the way here.  If there is ever a debate </p>about what to call something, as the people who will be using the site, go with what </p>works best for them. </p> </p><p><p>There are many different theories on how best to label sections within an information </p>architecture, and you might find yourself in some heated discussions with other team </p>members, content owners, marketing, etc.  For instance, for a contact section, do you use </p>"Contact Info", "Contact Us" or simply "Contact?"</p> </p><p><p>While these labels are very important, don't spend too much time on specifics, and try to </p>keep your users in mind.  Whatever you end up doing, make sure you keep it consistent, </p>don't go calling things by more than one label.  It's the information and the content that is </p>most important; the labels will take care of themselves in many cases.  We can't avoid </p>the fact that people will call things by many different names, and that's not even bringing </p>up the language issue.</p></p><p><p>These issues can be worked around with good <a href="http://www.pixellated.org/tools/metahelper.php">Meta data</a> and <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/tutorials/tutorial_2002-08.shtml">controlled vocabularies.</a>   Good Meta data will not </p>only help your users find items on your site, but can help search engines as well. But that </p>is a bit beyond the scope of this article.  The main thing is to keep the labels simple as </p>possible and make things easy for your users.  Once again, if you find out later a label </p>isn't working, it's the Web; you can change it.</p> </p><p><h2>Is that all?</h2></p><p>Well, not by a long shot, but at the same time we're not talking rocket science here.  </p>Information architecture is really just that.  An architecture for information.  It's </p>structuring your information in such a way that makes it easy to use for humans and </p>computers.  Just by understanding that simple fact and making an effort to learn about </p>information architecture will help to improve your sites in many ways.</p><p>So you want to know more?
