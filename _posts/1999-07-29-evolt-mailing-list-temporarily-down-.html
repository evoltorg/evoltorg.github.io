In case you haven't noticed, thelist@lists.evolt.org has been down for a couple hours, since about 2:30am CST this morning. The ISP( and evolt member Ron) that hosts our mailing list was doing a router upgrade, and now the darn thing won't boot. Unfortunatly, things like this happen in the computer world :)<P></p><p>We are all working very hard to bring the list back up, and I'll keep everyone posted here. Thanks for your understanding and patience!
