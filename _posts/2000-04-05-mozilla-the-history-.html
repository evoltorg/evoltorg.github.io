<P><I>This article is a pre-cursor to an article I'm publishing tomorrow that also</p>relates to Mozilla and the newly released Netscape 6. Hopefully by providing</p>some background on Mozilla project</i>  <i>separately, some points in my piece</p>tomorrow will make more sense.</I></p></P></p> <P> In January of 1998, Netscape made <a</p>href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-325840.html?tag=" target="_new">the</p>announcement</a> that it would stop selling its Communicator software and</p>would open up the source code to its entire Communicator suite of applications,</p>including Navigator, the application which displays and renders Web</p>pages. At the time, this was a revolutionary annuoncement and marked one of</p>the first times that a company would release the source code for software that</p>it had previously sold to consumers. This in turn led to increased interest</p><I>and</I> acceptance in the 'open source' model of successfull products like</p>the <a href="http://www.linux.com" target="_new">Linux operating system</a> and the <a</p>href="http://www.apache.org" target="_new">Apache webserver</a>. </P></p><P></p>The move was applauded by open source / free software advocates around the</p>world, and on March 31 1998, the 8Mb of source code was released to the world</p>from the newly formed <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_new">Mozilla</a> group. This group</p>would be responsible for managing the open source effort and coordinating the</p>work of internal Netscape (and down the road, Sun, AOL, and RedHat) engineers</p>and independant developers. In retrospect, it was a <strong>very</strong></p>exciting thing to be a part of. I remember staying up all night on IRC waiting</p>for the word that the source was released on the servers, along with many many</p>other people just like me. It felt like we were making history, and that this</p>move would redefine the way people used and developed for the Web.</p></P></p><P></p>After the hysteria calmed, people started to realize just what a huge project</p>this was going to be. It was rather chaotic with everyone trying to figure out</p>just where to start digging in the code. It was a big deal when someone</p>finally got it to compile about 2 or 3 days later.</p></P></p><p><P></p>Over the next year, things went pretty quietly. Netscape <a</p>href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-328469.html?tag=" target="_new">announced that</p>Gecko</a>, its new and improved rendering engine - the piece of software that</p>turns HTML into a readable webpage - would fully support HTML 4.0,</p>CSS1, limited CSS2, XML, and the Document Object Model(DOM) as specified by the <a href="http://www.w3.org" target="_new">W3C</a>. This was a big</p>announcement because it showed that the open source influence had some effect</p>on how standards-compliant this software would be. Web developers were</p>extremely pleased to know that they would finally have a rendering engine in a</p>major browser that was fully standards-compliant. Things got heated when</p>Netcape hinted they would release a 5.0 browser without the gecko engine,</p>ensuring that developers would have to wait another generation before</p>they'd get standards-compliance. Thanks to pressure from groups like the <a</p>href="http://www.webstandards.org" target="_new">Web Standards Project</a>, Netcape put</p>off the release of a 5.0 browser until it could include the gecko engine.</p></P></p><P></p>America Online also made it clear that it was looking into</p>purchasing Netcape Communications Corp., which raised fears among many that AOL would either kill</p>off or limit resources (by cutting engineers, money, etc.) that went toward</p>this free, open source project. To its credit, AOL quickly made its <a</p>href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-335990.html?tag=" target="_new">intentions</p>clear</a> that Mozilla would continute on as planned.</p></P></p><P></p>That spring was plagued by delays and questions asking if Netscape would</p>release a product under the Mozilla flag by its one year anniversery.</p></P></p><p></p>April 1st, 1999 was the one year anniversery of the birth of the Mozilla</p>project. It also proved to be a rather sad and uncertain time with lead</p>evangelist Jamie Zawinski <a</p>href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-340670.html?tag=st.ne.1005-200-341225-1005-200-341225." target="_new">leaving the project</a></p>and no 'product' shipped after a year's time. However, life moved on and the</p>summer of '99 proved to see some major improvements in the Mozilla browser.</p>During this time, Netscape also <a</p>href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-387924.html?tag=st.ne.1005-200-808813-1005-200-808813." target="_new">released</a></p>minor upgrades to the 4.x series of the Communicator suite including the</p>Winamp MP3 player, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), and higher profile shopping links in</p>the <a href="http://home.netscape.com" target="_new">Netcenter</a> portal. </p></P></p><P></p>Time rolled by, new milestones were reached. Thousands of bugs were squashed.</p>Some shrugged off Mozilla as a 'Never-has-been' technology, but still the work</p>continued.</p></P></p><p></p>Yesterday, the preview release of Netscape 6.0 was released to the general public</p>amid fanfare and Steve Case's predictions of <a</p>href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2522291,00.html" target="_new">AOL</p>Anywhere</a>. Indeed, AOL's top man predicts that the company's new strategy</p>will revolutionize the way we use the Internet. Much of Case's predicted</p>revolution will rely on Mozilla technology - which is a revolution in itself.</p></P>
