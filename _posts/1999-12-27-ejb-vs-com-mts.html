<P>Ever wondered what the differences between Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Enterprise Java Beans</a> and Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/complus.asp" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Component Object Model+</a> / <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/com/tech/mts.asp" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Microsoft Transaction Server</a> were? How they stack up against eachother? Just what the heck they are in the first place?</P></p><P></p>A couple developers have written some <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/ejbvscom.html" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">whitepapers</a> that compare the two, with input from the developer community and leading middleware authorities.</p></P></p><P></p>Even though it has a slight EJB(and pro Java) slant to it, still a good read if you're interested in knowing more about Enterprise application models.</p></P>
