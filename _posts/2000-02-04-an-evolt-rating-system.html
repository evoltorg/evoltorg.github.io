today's <i>elbow grease</i> newsletter drew my attention to a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,34076,00.html" target="_new">wired news article</a> about <b>VA linux</b> buying <b>Andover</b>, who recently bought <a href="http://slashdot.org" target="_new">slashdot</a>  <p> this led in turn to an <A href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,21448,00.html" target="_new">older wired story</a> describing slashdot in detail  (where was i when this first came out?) <p> of particular interest to evolt is this excerpt: <blockquote> "In this [slashdot] model you don't have editors deciding what is legitimate and what isn't... The flip  side is that you don't have [an editor's] assurance in what is to be trusted and what isn't to be trusted."  </blockquote> <p> evolt has a team of editors <p> (we used to have an "editorial committee" and "publicity committee" and so on, but the  whole committee concept sort of died, quite some time ago) <p> evolt's team of editors are simply those individual evolt members who have "admin"  privilege, and their primary role is to approve articles <p> so evolt has a minimal amount of regulation, unlike slashdot, which would appear to have none, judging by the wired story  (i don't have enough time to read slashdot very often myself) <p> but this minimal amount of regulation has a fabulous leverage on the quality of the articles that get posted to the evolt site <p> not that i'm against the idea of "distributed trust" but i do believe the evolt method is right for us at this point in time <p> from the same article -- <blockquote> "All that seems to be missing from Slashdot-type sites is some kind of reputation rating system, where participants are assigned a trust rating based on feedback from the group and managed by a central authority." </blockquote> so a favourable rating on an article from someone who is highly-rated should have more weight than  a favourable rating from  an unknown person? <p> we were only thinking of rating articles by number of hits, but this opens up many possibilities <p>  should evolt have a rating system? <p> your feedback and suggestions are welcome... <p> <P>
