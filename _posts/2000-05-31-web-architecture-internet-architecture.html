<p>Investigating about the process of Web Architecture I found this document <a href=http://earth.path.net/mitra/uri/IIIA.html>Integrated </p>  Internet Information Architecture</a>, By Chris Weider. I started reading it </p>  believing it was another approach to Website Architecture, and I found their </p>  proposal marvelous. </p></p><blockquote>... In addition, as more and more communities use the Internet to store their </p>  information and transport their communications, we will need to allow them to </p>  transition gracefully from their current methods to new methods which utilize </p>  the full power of the Net. We cannot require them to rewrite their data to deliver </p>  it over Internet information tools because in many cases they have already developed </p>  tools and protocols analogous to those in use on the Internet.; we must provide </p>  them with an information architecture which allows them to use tools with which </p>  they are comfortable while integrating them into the current information mesh... </p></blockquote></p><p>Until I bumped into their example, instead of showing a website, it displayed </p>  the backend behind the Internet Servers and Displays. I checked the date: September </p>  1994, my hair fell. I kept on reading, and each paragraph of their methodology </p>  made even more sense for me to implement in Website Architecture, there's even </p>  a paragraph called "Payments, Charging & Accounting" </p></p><blockquote>...As with security, it is neccessary to hide a variety of different schemes </p>  under a common interface. Payments system seem to come under two fairly different </p>  classes, either digital cash based - where a token that has value is passed </p>  around, or cheque based - where an IOU is passed around. The commonality of </p>  these can be expressed with the following functions...</blockquote></p><p> And further on the document is a strange mixture of material extremely valuable </p>  to modern Web Architecture and technical info about how the Internet could best </p>  work. </p></p><p>The question goes to all the modern Web Architects within our community, what </p>  do you think? Is this just a coincidence? </p>
