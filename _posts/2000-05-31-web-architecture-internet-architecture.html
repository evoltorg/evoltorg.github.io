<p>Investigating about the process of Web Architecture I found this document <a href=http://earth.path.net/mitra/uri/IIIA.html>Integrated \n  Internet Information Architecture</a>, By Chris Weider. I started reading it \n  believing it was another approach to Website Architecture, and I found their \n  proposal marvelous. </p>\n<blockquote>... In addition, as more and more communities use the Internet to store their \n  information and transport their communications, we will need to allow them to \n  transition gracefully from their current methods to new methods which utilize \n  the full power of the Net. We cannot require them to rewrite their data to deliver \n  it over Internet information tools because in many cases they have already developed \n  tools and protocols analogous to those in use on the Internet.; we must provide \n  them with an information architecture which allows them to use tools with which \n  they are comfortable while integrating them into the current information mesh... \n</blockquote>\n<p>Until I bumped into their example, instead of showing a website, it displayed \n  the backend behind the Internet Servers and Displays. I checked the date: September \n  1994, my hair fell. I kept on reading, and each paragraph of their methodology \n  made even more sense for me to implement in Website Architecture, there's even \n  a paragraph called "Payments, Charging & Accounting" </p>\n<blockquote>...As with security, it is neccessary to hide a variety of different schemes \n  under a common interface. Payments system seem to come under two fairly different \n  classes, either digital cash based - where a token that has value is passed \n  around, or cheque based - where an IOU is passed around. The commonality of \n  these can be expressed with the following functions...</blockquote>\n<p> And further on the document is a strange mixture of material extremely valuable \n  to modern Web Architecture and technical info about how the Internet could best \n  work. </p>\n<p>The question goes to all the modern Web Architects within our community, what \n  do you think? Is this just a coincidence? </p>
