Starting with the communication ends that online media support, he moved back through design, HTML and server-side code. Then he got into running the whole show.
These days he's working for <a href=\"http://www-5.ibm.com/services/uk/services/bcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these people</a> as a Project Manager, and still thinks (nearly 6 years on) it's a hell of a lot better than working for a dot-com. In his Copious Free Time&trade;, he helps out running a <a href=\"http://www.purpur.co.uk/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloth Nappies</a> online store.
</p>

<p>Amongst his favourite things is <del><strike><a href=\"http://www.zope.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">Zope</a></strike></del><ins><a href=\"http://drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal</a></ins>, which he uses to run his <a href=\"http://www.easyweb.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">personal site</a>. He's starting to (re)gain a sneaking regard for ECMAscript since the arrival of unobtrusive scripting.</p> 

<p>He's been a member of evolt.org since the very early days, a board member, a president, a writer and even contributed a modest amount of template code for the current site. Above all, he likes evolt.org to do things because it knowingly chooses to do so, rather than randomly stumbling into them. He's also one of the boys and girls who beervolts in the UK, although the arrival of small children in his life have knocked the frequency for 6.</p>

<p>Picture it: You've a great idea for the next Amazon, and you now need to talk to Venture Capitalists, developers, ad partners and so on. But you don't want them stealing your idea and running away with it.</p></p><p><p>Your solution: A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). This basically says that you can talk to people in the knowledge that they will treat the matter confidentially. Of course, this should go both ways, so if a developer starts talking about how they're going to put it together in <A href="http://www.broadvision.com/">Broadvision</A>, you can't run off to their competition and get them to implement that same system.</p></p><p><p>NDAs are also <em>very</em> useful if you're working in a team with competitors - they won't look at what else is going on in your office and go tell their bosses all about it.</p></p><p><p>Here's a simple example. Note that you  <em>will</em>  have to check this with a competent lawyer in all relevent juristictions. I am in no way offering legal advice, simply a basis to start from.</p></p><HR></p><H2>Letter of Confidentiality</H2></p><p>This document is a Confidentiality Agreement between the following Parties:</p></p><p>TheirName, Company Name, Company Address Including Postcode And Any Relationship With Parent Company/Subsidiaries</p></p><p>In the first part, hereinafter referred to as <strong>the Company</strong> , and</p></p><p>YourName, YourAddress</p></p><p>In the second part, hereinafter referred to as <strong>the Consultants.</strong></p></p><p>On the subject of <strong>the Company</strong> supplying information, business plans, training handbooks, copies of documents, specifications, drawings, access to consultants/researchers etc. during the course of <strong>the Consultants</strong>' involvement <strong>the Consultants</strong> hereby confirm as follows:</p></p><OL></p>	<li>That all information whenever disclosed by <strong>the Company</strong> to <strong>the Consultants</strong> shall remain the property of <strong>the Company</strong> and on the termination of <strong>the   Consultants</strong>' interest <strong>the Consultants</strong> will on request return all   information to <strong>the Company</strong> and shall at the same time if requested supply written   confirmation that all documents, specifications, samples, information handbooks and   drawings relating to the information in <strong>the Consultants</strong> ' possession have been   returned to <strong>the Company</strong> or have been destroyed.</li></p>	<li><strong>The Consultants</strong> will not use the information for any purpose other than in   connection with <strong>the Consultants</strong>' involvement with <strong>the Company</strong> and on   its behalf. <strong>The Consultants</strong> shall keep all information secret and confidential. <strong>The   Consultants</strong> shall not without the consent of <strong>the Company</strong> communicate or allow   to be communicated any confidential information to anyone, except as otherwise authorised   by <strong>the Company</strong>.</li></p>	<li>On the termination of <strong>the Consultants</strong>' involvement <strong>the Consultants</strong> shall   forthwith cease all further use of the information.</li></p>	<li><strong>The Consultants</strong>  confirm their acceptance of retention by <strong>the Company</strong> of all <strong>the Company?s</strong> existing rights and patents.</li></p>	<li><strong>The Consultants</strong>' agreement to the confidentiality aspect of this Agreement is subject to:</p></p>	<OL type="i"></p>		<li>Any information becoming common knowledge.</p>		<li>The information contained in individual patent applications being published.</p>	</OL></p>	</p><p>When either of the above two possibilities occurs <strong>the Consultants</strong> may regard as   ceasing to be confidential information only to the extent that i) or ii) has occurred.</p></p></li></p></OL></p><TABLE border="0" width="100%" class='grey2'></p>	<TR></p>		<TD width="50%"><small>Signed:<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>Date<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></small></p>		</TD></p>		<TD width="50%"><small>Signed:<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>Date<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></small></p>		</TD></p>	</TR></p>	<TR></p>		<TD width="50%"><small>For and on behalf of <strong>the Consultants</strong> </small></p>		</TD></p>		<TD width="50%"><small>For and on behalf of <strong>the Company</small></strong> </p>		</TD></p>	</TR></p>	<TR></p>		<TD width="50%"><small>Name: Ms Foo Bar</small></p>		</TD></p>		<TD width="50%"><small>Name: Mr Ping Pong</small></p>		</TD></p>	</TR></p>	<TR></p>		<TD width="50%"><small>Position: Director</small></p>		</TD></p>		<TD width="50%"><small>Position: Owner</small></p>		</TD></p>	</TR></p></TABLE></p><HR><p>Here's another example:</p></p><h2>MUTUAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT</h2><p>Dated:</p> </p><p><p>Between:</p></p><OL></p>	<li>XXX registered office barbarbarbarbarbar and</p>	<li>The Company pligpligpligpligpligplig</p></OL></p><h4>Introduction</h4><p>XXX wants to discuss a confidential</p>project (the 'Project') with the Company and will need to disclose to the Company confidential information relating to the Project and to XXX's businesses, technology, products and plans for the future.
