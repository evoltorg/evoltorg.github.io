Starting with the communication ends that online media support, he moved back through design, HTML and server-side code. Then he got into running the whole show.
These days he's working for <a href=\"http://www-5.ibm.com/services/uk/services/bcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these people</a> as a Project Manager, and still thinks (nearly 6 years on) it's a hell of a lot better than working for a dot-com. In his Copious Free Time&trade;, he helps out running a <a href=\"http://www.purpur.co.uk/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloth Nappies</a> online store.

<p>Amongst his favourite things is <del><strike><a href=\"http://www.zope.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">Zope</a></strike></del><ins><a href=\"http://drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal</a></ins>, which he uses to run his <a href=\"http://www.easyweb.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">personal site</a>. He's starting to (re)gain a sneaking regard for ECMAscript since the arrival of unobtrusive scripting.</p> 

<p>He's been a member of evolt.org since the very early days, a board member, a president, a writer and even contributed a modest amount of template code for the current site. Above all, he likes evolt.org to do things because it knowingly chooses to do so, rather than randomly stumbling into them. He's also one of the boys and girls who beervolts in the UK, although the arrival of small children in his life have knocked the frequency for 6.</p>

Internet access at home has doubled in the last 12 months in the UK, and is now growing twice as fast as in the US, according to a survey released last week.</p><p>Almost a quarter of people in the UK have access to the Web at home, with most people using it primarily to send and receive email.</p><p>The survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers also confirms that time spent online is rising, with UK users spending an average of 2.5 hours a week surfing the Net compared with 2.2 hours last year. This amount is still well below the US, where users spend on average 5.3 hours a week online.</p><p>When asked what stopped them spending more time on the Net, UK users said that cost was the most important factor. For US users faster and more reliable access was most often cited.</p><p>The survey took a sample of over 3,000 people from across Europe and the US and is available from PricewaterhouseCoopers at <a href='mailto:convergence@us.pwcglobal.com'>convergence@us.pwcglobal.com</a>.
