Well, not really <b>burning mad</b>, but I'm pretty frustrated; I tried <a href="http://burnallgifs.org/" target="_new">burning all my GIFs</a> this evening, and it's not as easy as they make it sound.             burnallgifs.org talks about freely available software that "can automatically convert an entire website" to PNGs.  Sounds great, I thought.</p><p></p>I downloaded <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/gif2png/" target="_new">gif2png</a> and tried to install it, but got the error message:  <p></p><blockquote></p>PNG library is missing! Please get it.</p></blockquote></p>Hmmm.  Okay.  After consulting the unhelpful documentation, I managed to figure out that what I needed was something called "libpng."  Okay -- no problem.  I download <i>that</i> and am about to install it when I read:</p><p></p><blockquote></p>Before installing libpng, you must first install zlib.</p></blockquote></p><p>At this point, I decide that I'm as far down the rabbit hole as I'm willing to go, thanks.</p><p>No problem, I think -- here's a <a href="http://pegasus.uni-paderborn.de/enno/burnallgifs/" target="_new">Windows version</a>. Of course, the web page for it just says, "don't complain to me if it doesn't work," and doesn't provide any actual instructions on how to use it.  I've tried launching it, and it opens a little DOS-like window and promptly does nothing.</p><p>I suppose eventually I'll just use </p>Photoshop to save all my GIF files as PNGs, and edit all my webpages to point to the new files.  But not tonight.
