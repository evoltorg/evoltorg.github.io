excerpt: "Publishing on the internet and getting feedback could be a great experience. Problem is, that many a time you end up with a lot more unwanted feedback. This article describes certain types of online users that can make your life hell and how to deal with them."

<p>The Internet is an amazing thing - as a media it was and is a</p>revolution. Everybody can participate, publishing and amending content is a </p>matter of seconds and a lot of it is free. Let's take part, shall we?</p></p><p>Fame, fortune and great feedback await us, so let's put our work out there </p>for people to find and enjoy.</p></p><p>Alas, it seems as soon as you publish something and allow people to comment on it </p>or use it, you're in for a rude awakening.</p></p><p>Stay with us and hear a tale of the foes we have on the web. All of the upcoming</p>characters are purely non-fictional.</p></p><p><h2>Meet the army of spoilers</h2></p><p><h3>The professional spammer</h3></p><p>His job is to find emails to send important things - like penis enhancement </p>products or drugs you cannot get that cheap in the pharmacy - to them.</p> </p><h4>Countermeasures</h4></p><p>There is not much of a remedy against the spammer. As soon as your email is </p>readable somewhere and in the source of the page, it can and will be </p>harvested by spam robots and you are in for a filled inbox. There are many </p>ideas as to how to stop that - obfuscating the email via Javascript, or adding </p>it as an image. These are effective to some degree, but could challenge usability </p>or accessibility. A rather spam-free way to allow people to contact </p>you is an email form. Keep the email addresses in a database and simply </p>reference them by key. In any case, a spam filter on your mailbox is in order.</p></p><p><h3>The clumsy spammer</h3></p><p>Links make the web work. Links also make Google recognise and rank our pages. </p>That is why some people tend to sneak in links pointing to their web sites into comments </p>by turning random words and punctuation into links. It may or may not be that Google does </p>follow links that have a dash or a full stop as their textual content, in any </p>case it is a clumsy and rather pathetic try to raise awareness for your web site.</p></p><h4>Countermeasures</h4></p><p>Either disallow links, or display them as full text. That way the comments </p>will be named and shamed and you can see the spamming immediately and remove the links </p>or the full comment.</p></p><p><h3>The hacker</h3></p><p>Religious debates about Unix vs. FreeBSD vs. Windows aside - your server is </p>constantly open to attacks by hackers or hacker wannabees. The argument &#34;but </p>the stuff I publish is free and I am not an evil corporation&#34; doesn't work any </p>longer. A server is a server and if I can hack my way into it, I can use it as </p>an online hard disk to store data on.</p></p><h4>Countermeasures</h4></p><p>Don't do the server maintenance, if you don't know what you are doing. Make </p>sure to use complex passwords and change them regularly. If you install scripts </p>and extensions on your server, follow the instructions and do not leave scripts </p>with names like &#34;admin&#34; unprotected. If the script allows it, rename them, or </p>secure them with a password via .htaccess or equivalents.</p></p><p><h3>The citizen of me-oh-me-ia</h3></p><p>This dysfunctional breed is prone to fill comment facilities with off-topic </p>messages pointing in their direction, an example would be: &#34;Wow, cool </p>article about accessible navigations. I think <a href="/Survival_in_the_online_trenches#" title="an example link leading nowhere">my </p>web site about making little furry animals from dental floss</a> could need it&#34;.</q></p><p>Furthermore, the citizens of me-oh-me-ia also have the perception that their </p>setup is the world's: &#34;Your script works fine on all common browsers, but my </p>browser XYZ does not support it. Therefore it is useless&#34;.</p></p><h4>Countermeasures</h4></p><p>This type is more annoying than really destructive. Therefore you can either</p>just counterargument in the comments, or, in case of serial offenders, delete</p>them. People like these keep us from really improving our sites and adding new </p>content, as we have to spend all that time on maintenance.</p></p><p><h3>The &#34;My help request right or wrong&#34; user</h3></p><p>This type has the impression that you are either all-knowing, or that you do </p>have the inclination and time to help out no matter how unrelated the request is.</p>&#34;I have seen your PHP script, and I like it, how can I set up a server to </p>run it?&#34; or &#34;I see you publish a lot of articles, can you tell me what </p>laptop is the best&#34; are typical examples. They most likely don't mean to be </p>annoying, they just think you like helping people, and you do, but surely not with </p>everything.</p></p><h4>Countermeasures</h4></p><p>As stated above, this behaviour can be due to not knowing better and misreading </p>your nice texts as a &#34;come on all, I'll sort you out&#34;. Therefore punishing </p>is not really a good response. Better point them to example pages. For more on </p>this, read &#34;<a href="http://www.evolt.org/helponline">How to help and get help online</a>&#34;. </p>Try to be nice, breathe in and out 10 times before answering something like </p>&#34;Have you tried this very secret web site called Google&#34; or &#34;RTFM&#34;.</p></p><p><h3>The bad implementer</h3></p><p>If you publish scripts and you thought you made them idiot proof, rest assured </p>that someone will come up with a better idiot. Either your documentation is bad,</p>or just too extensive. A good documentation does not help, as, sad but true, </p>people do not read them. That is why you end up with people using your scripts,</p>failing to secure them properly and come complaining to you about &#34;being hacked&#34;.</p></p><p>You can even point out 10 times that you made a template and a user does not </p>need to know language XYZ to re-skin it, you'll still get people telling you </p>that they can't use it as they don't know XYZ.</p></p><h4>Countermeasures</h4></p><p>Again, a user that you don't want to annoy too much. They are not evil, they </p>are misled (or lazy). Point out the documentation again, if inclined, help them </p>hands-on. Write your documentation concise and short (Step by Step examples proved</p>to be helpful) and make your scripts check if they are insecure (is the file </p>still called admin? Can it be written to?).</p></p><p><h3>Dr. Test and Mr. Hello</h3></p><p>This dynamic duo is always on the hunt for innocent form fields, like sign-up </p>fields for newsletters, guestbooks or even contact forms, just to fill them </p>with &#34;test&#34; or &#34;hello&#34; and send them off. There is no name for </p>this fetish yet, but it seems to give them a lot of pleasure.</p></p><h4>Countermeasures</h4></p><p>Simply make sure you review the guestbook entries before they get published, </p>check fields for the words above and don't submit them when that is their only </p>content.</p></p><p><h3>The all-knowing developer</h3></p><p>This kind will comment on anything you do with a confident &#34;I have done </p>that years ago&#34; and accuse you of being inefficient if you don't apply </p>technique XYZ to the problem ABC. He will also claim having had the idea years </p>before and didn't &#34;feel like writing about it&34;</p></p><h4>Countermeasures</h4></p><p>Point out that an example is an example and that there are many ways to </p>achieve the same goal. Also point out that less optimised examples may be </p>necessary to explain certain techniques. Congratulate them on their greatness and </p>tell them to start writing themselves. They'll soon realise it is not as easy as</p>creating a perfect code solution.</p></p><p><h3>Trolls</h3></p><p>The worst of the web. Trolls are people that post only to annoy and attack </p>others. They offend for the sake of offending and are very likely to cause long-winded,</p>off-topic discussions if their baits were successful.</p></p><h4>Countermeasures</h4></p><p>Delete posts, block if possible. Keep the lid on the jar of trollnip and call</p>Harry Potter.</p></p><p><h2>"Fame's a fickle friend, Harry"</h2></p><p>The more success your site has, or the more you publish, the more likely it is </p>that you will encounter one or more of the above. It seems as if free speech is </p>a nice enough concept, but only a chosen few know how to use it wisely, whereas </p>the people abusing it are legion. The reasons might be of various nature: envy, </p>boredom, unhappy childhood, inability to communicate in real life - you name it.</p></p><p>You end up using your time maintaining the comments and the contacts you get,</p>and doing less and less for the site, unless you are lucky enough to be able to </p>delegate that job.</p></p><p>Why we do it despite of all these issues? Because we can, and because we have </p>to, to keep this wonderful new media alive.</p> </p><p>Every comment and mail needs to be checked and tended to, so next time you </p>feel the urge to write something about an online text you saw, think of the </p>consequences, and try not to fall into any of the above categories.</p>
