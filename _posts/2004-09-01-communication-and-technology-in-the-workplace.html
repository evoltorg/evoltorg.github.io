<p></p>	A common dilemma facing businesses large and small alike is how best to equip </p>	their staff to deliver the largest amount of productivity, weighed against </p>	the increasing costs of the technology necessary to deliver that productivity. </p>	Lately there seems to be no shortage of new technology, including a multitude </p>	of pagers, cell phones, and Blackberry-esque devices to choose from based </p>	on a company's fancy... or budget.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	There is a difference, however, between the myriad of choices available to </p>	consumers and whether or not the correct device exists for one's needs. </p>	A pager, almost an antiquated device these days, only lets its user know </p>	of a short message or phone number to regard; a cell phone is usable only </p>	when a strong enough signal is available, and Blackberry-type devices are </p>	great for two-way communication via email and telephony, but present very </p>	real cost hurdles.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	Let's put cost hurdles aside for the sake of argument. Granted, that's </p>	a loaded request, as if we could so easily disregard the cost of items, </p>	we would have little dilemma about which technology to implement to meet </p>	our needs. Try it though, you'll like it.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	Clearly a fully-functioning computer is going to offer the most amount </p>	of flexibility and communication potential, save for the use of a telephone.</p>	Email and messaging capabilities are often the most efficient way of sending </p>	information to large groups at once; whereas the telephone offers speed of </p>	connectivity, provided you have a clear signal and your recipient is able to </p>	answer the call. The natural extension of these two technologies ends up as </p>	a melding of each, into one device. If presented with a colleague who </p>	won't/can't/doesn't answer the telephone, send an email message; if you </p>	can't be bothered to type anything more than a few characters, create a </p>	&quot;call me @ 555-1212&quot; message and tap Send; if you need to send </p>	a file while sitting in traffic, pen a real email with an attachment.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	Additionally, it's important to not load down your workers with a </p>	multitude of devices. They have to want to use what's issued to them </p>	because it makes their job easier, faster, better, six-million-dollar-man-like, </p>	not reach for five different pieces of electronics strapped to various places </p>	on their body. They'll have to work on relying on a new piece of equipment in </p>	addition to their everyday computer, but won't have to carry several different </p>	things to get their jobs done. As a business, you'll have to work on justifying </p>	the costs, both intellectual and actual, of rolling out a new technology. </p>	Fortunately for you, a few of those justifications are below.</p></p></p><p><h2>Accessibility</h2></p><p>	</p>	Access not only to information, but to people as well. The file does you no good </p>	without context. The person does you no good without the detail contained in </p>	the file. Miss one, and you miss meeting the deadline, signing the contract, </p>	closing the deal. There was a meeting scheduled for this afternoon... your managers </p>	didn't know to attend because they were attending other meetings and weren't </p>	next to the laptop. The client calls and says everything is perfect except for </p>	that one file they've misplaced. &quot;Can you resend it please?&quot;  </p>	&quot;Sure, as soon as I get back to the office.&quot;  Too late, another </p>	vendor stepped in. It's just that fast.</p></p></p><p><h2>Communication</h2></p><p>	</p>	Communication is quite distinct from accessibility. Being able to touch someone </p>	electronically does no good without the context need to interpret those touches. </p>	Once a fire starts to burn, it's the manager's responsibility to wield the extinguisher. </p>	If you get a page or email of simply &quot;help, the client is unhappy,&quot; </p>	you're powerless to do anything without situational context. Talking someone </p>	through an issue cannot be replaced by a volley of emails or text messages, no </p>	matter how neat the device is you're sending them with.</p></p></p><p><h2>Usability</h2></p><p>	</p>	Access and communication are useless if the technology deployed is counterintuitive </p>	or counterproductive. Having managers carry twelve-pound-anythings means they won't </p>	use them. Issuing devices with less than the necessary functionality are as useless </p>	as those left in their cases. A small, functional, clear and always-on device will </p>	be able to meet the accessible and communicative needs of today's fast-paced businesses.</p></p></p><p><h2>Return On Investment</h2></p><p>	</p>	Yes, I asked you to disregard money for a moment, but that's over. Welcome back.</p></p></p><p></p>	The cost of implementing the technology necessary to fully equip your workforce, </p>	even if only at the management level, must be recouped in a very real fashion. </p>	There is no getting around the initial, and often very large, cost of this kind of </p>	implementation. What a business is able to show as a result of the investment </p>	is where the real value will be apparent. These results are often indirectly </p>	proven: increased customer satisfaction, improved employee efficiency, faster </p>	reaction times to issues, and a more efficient, more informed workforce. </p>	These so-called 'soft dollars' may sound trivial, but you'll be hard-pressed </p>	to argue against increasing customer satisfaction, employee efficiency, reaction </p>	times, et cetera.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	Not every employee needs a $600 neat-o device in addition to their laptop/desktop </p>	or whatever other technology issued to them. Those employees charged with managing </p>	other employees, managing clients, or otherwise responsible for ensuring the business</p>	 runs as efficiently as possible should have all of the tools necessary to make </p>	 these goals a reality. Budget is also a clear factor, as not every business will </p>	 be able to equip their force with the latest and greatest. In both cases, the onus </p>	 falls on the business to research the available technology and determine which </p>	 implementation best suits their needs and the needs of their clients, employees, </p>	 and stakeholders.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	Even though the initial outlay for such a rollout usually requires a significant </p>	amount of capital, remember the return on investment is measured in long term </p>	productivity and efficiency. Businesses better able and more equipped to respond </p>	to their customer's needs are going to beat their competitors to the punch every </p>	single time. By taking advantage of the fusing of communication with available technology, </p>	and properly leveraging that fusion, you'll stay right where you want to be: at </p>	your customer's fingertips and first on their minds.</p></p>
