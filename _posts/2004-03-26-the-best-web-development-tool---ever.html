<p>Many a time you read the same question on message boards, mailing lists and in </p>chat channels - What is the best tool for web development?</p> </p><p>A tough one, really, as a good tool should meet so many different requirements.</p> </p><p><p>It should</p></p><ul> </p>	<li>make sure that development takes place in a neat and ordered manner</li></p>	<li>be cheap and do the job without a lot of fuss</li></p>	<li>not be hard to use or confuse more than help</li></p>	<li>be usable on the go</li></p>	<li>save time and money</li></p></ul></p><p>There is one tool that does all that. It is called a <em>pen</em>. You use it </p>by rubbing the pin-pointed end against a fitting surface - say <em>paper</em> - and </p>paint and write things with it. </p></p><p><h2>How can that <em>pen</em> thing help us?</h2></p><p><p>One problem with web design is that we are still completely obsessed with it. </p>It is still an exciting and new media - interactive, fast, international and </p>huge.</p> </p><p>When we use our computers to surf around and open a fully fledged web </p>development tool, we are likely to get drawn to developing something that is </p>cool, technically challenging, new and colourful. The big danger in that is,</p>that we forget the usefulness, the scalability or, very often, even </p>the purpose of the product.</p> </p><p>So let's turn off that computer, or use it to </p>play some music to get our brain going.</p> </p><p><h2>Plan it and they will come</h2></p><p><p>Let's take the <em>pen</em> and write down who we want to reach, and what we </p>want to give them. Let's brainstorm and write down all the stuff that we really </p>really want to have in there. To add some fun to it, let's invent some possible</p>visitors or users of our web site, and guess what their likes are and how they </p>access the web. If you are a visual person, doodle them - but don't get carried </p>away. Let's make sure the persona are not the same as us.</p> </p><p>Let's take all kinds,</p> </p><ul></p>	<li>the fast business executive, who never has enough time </li></p>	<li>the lovely lady in the chip shop with the thick glasses</li></p>	<li>the computer geek next door who really answers &#34;LOL&#34; when you tell him a joke</li></p>	<li>your elderly aunt, who has this slight shake when moving her hand </li></p>	<li>the hippie girl from the bus who is just a bit off into dream world all the time, </p>	and prefers to play and explore &#34;nice&#34; things rather than facing hard facts.</li></p></ul></p><p><h2>Sorting the goodies</h2></p><p><p>Then we use another paper and sort the things we want to have online into </p>categories, and, if necessary, into sub categories. Once that is done, let's sort </p>them by priority.</p></p><p><p>If the things are long and hard to read, let's think of shorter names for them.</p> </p><p><p>Let's go through the list of things and think hard if they really need to be </p>there, or if they are a &#34;nice to have&#34; which can be added later or after we </p>saw how successful the other bits are. Let's take these &#34;nice to have&#34;s and put </p>them on another paper crossing them out on the first one, or - if we have the </p>professional version of <em>pen</em> - use the end opposite of the point to erase them.</p> </p><p>Let's sit back, take a sip of coffee or tea, or do something different for a while, </p>come back and have another go at moving things to the &#34;maybe later&#34; paper.</p></p><p><p>Alright, we have a list of what we want to have. Now let's take </p>another paper and think what our visitors (the doodles, remember?) need</p>or expect to reach them.</p></p><p><h2>Catering for the masses</h2></p><p><ul></p>	<li>The fast business executive doesn't have the time to figure out the </p>	navigation (even when it only takes some seconds) - her first goal will be </p>	to find a search functionality, that really leads to results. If she can't </p>	find it, or the results are meaningless, we lost her.</li></p>	<li>The lady with the thick glasses might have trouble reading text and </p>	navigation online and therefore has the biggest font setting, let's make </p>	sure she can read our navigation, and her big fonts don't mess up our </p>	design. This also means we cannot use a graphical navigation, as not all </p>	browsers allow for magnification of images, and she might not care for </p>	upgrading her browser - this takes too long and is too complex to do.</li></p>	<li>The computer geek wants to see what you got and take part, he is likely </p>	to register to be able to give comments and take part and give his piece of </p>	mind about your work.</li></p>	<li>Auntie should be considered when we think about the navigation, </p>	looking around the web, we might have seen loads of cool multi-level drop </p>	down navigations, but with that shaking hand in mind, they become not so hot </p>	an idea out of a sudden. </li></p>	<li>The hippie girl wants nice colours and see things change when she does </p>	something. Roll-overs might still be a nice and new thing to her, and they </p>	don't hurt to add.</li></p></ul></p><p>Let's write down some of these assumptions.</p></p><p><h2>Moving on</h2></p><p><p>Alright, this is where we got to. The powerfull application "pen" gave us so far:</p></p><p><ul></p>	<li>A site map of all the pages we want to create, already sorted into </p>	categories, which translates to a navigation concept.</li></p>	<li>A wish list of the elements we should include into the page to make all </p>	of the possible visitors we care about happy. </li></p></ul></p><p><p>Bear in mind that we do not have to give them all the same experience, if our </p>web site will offer newest stock market trends, we don't have to cater a lot </p>to the glasses lady, Auntie or the hippie girl.</p></p><p>A web site about game mods and cheats might not really give Auntie or </p>the busy business executive, or even the hippie girl, a kick.</p></p><p>One thing we don't want though is become elitist and block them out. Give them </p>what they can use, and enhance for our target audience, is what we want.</p></p><p><h2>Re-entering the digital world</h2></p><p><p>Now we turn on the computer, and we start our web product. With what? With a </p>folder called "my_website" or something similar. In this folder we create </p>folders with the names of our navigation elements, and the neccessary subfolders.</p></p><p><p>Now we take a text editor, doesn't really matter which - as long as it is capable</p>of clean text and is portable to various platforms - and start writing the </p>content of each of the pages we want to create. Let's sort the text into </p>headlines, lists and paragraphs, and if we need an image for the content, put </p>that image into the appropriate folder. </p></p><p><p>Close the text, get a bagel or another coffee, walk the dog or take a breath </p>of fresh air. Come back and delete as much as you could. Remember, users don't </p>read, they <em>scan</em> on the web. Don't smother them with long winded talk, get to the</p>point.</p></p><p><p>Ok, we are prepared and ready. We can start our web site, with our favourite </p>editor and graphical environment. We can start designing the pages, choose the</p>navigation (left hand, left hand and horizontal, horizontal, tabs, right hand...)</p>and create the pages. Personally I like using includes in PHP, but if you want </p>to use something else or create each page by hand, do that.</p> </p><p><p>The <em>pen</em> helped us a lot in finding, sorting and honing what we want to put </p>on the web, a lot faster and cheaper than trial and error in any fancy web</p>development package. It helped us avoiding flashy traps that might have annoyed </p>a lot of users. And we were able to do that anytime and anywhere.</p></p><p><p>It also enables people who don't know how to create web sites to prepare the </p>content for the web developers in a clean way, no searching through hundreds</p>of emails or copying and pasting from one word file.</p></p><p><p>Surely the mightiest web development tool of them all.</p>
