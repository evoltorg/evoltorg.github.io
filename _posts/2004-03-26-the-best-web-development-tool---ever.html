<p>Many a time you read the same question on message boards, mailing lists and in \nchat channels - What is the best tool for web development?</p> \n<p>A tough one, really, as a good tool should meet so many different requirements.</p> </p><p><p>It should</p>\n<ul> \n	<li>make sure that development takes place in a neat and ordered manner</li>\n	<li>be cheap and do the job without a lot of fuss</li>\n	<li>not be hard to use or confuse more than help</li>\n	<li>be usable on the go</li>\n	<li>save time and money</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is one tool that does all that. It is called a <em>pen</em>. You use it \nby rubbing the pin-pointed end against a fitting surface - say <em>paper</em> - and \npaint and write things with it. </p></p><p><h2>How can that <em>pen</em> thing help us?</h2></p><p><p>One problem with web design is that we are still completely obsessed with it. \nIt is still an exciting and new media - interactive, fast, international and \nhuge.</p> \n<p>When we use our computers to surf around and open a fully fledged web \ndevelopment tool, we are likely to get drawn to developing something that is \ncool, technically challenging, new and colourful. The big danger in that is,\nthat we forget the usefulness, the scalability or, very often, even \nthe purpose of the product.</p> \n<p>So let's turn off that computer, or use it to \nplay some music to get our brain going.</p> </p><p><h2>Plan it and they will come</h2></p><p><p>Let's take the <em>pen</em> and write down who we want to reach, and what we \nwant to give them. Let's brainstorm and write down all the stuff that we really \nreally want to have in there. To add some fun to it, let's invent some possible\nvisitors or users of our web site, and guess what their likes are and how they \naccess the web. If you are a visual person, doodle them - but don't get carried \naway. Let's make sure the persona are not the same as us.</p> \n<p>Let's take all kinds,</p> \n<ul>\n	<li>the fast business executive, who never has enough time </li>\n	<li>the lovely lady in the chip shop with the thick glasses</li>\n	<li>the computer geek next door who really answers &#34;LOL&#34; when you tell him a joke</li>\n	<li>your elderly aunt, who has this slight shake when moving her hand </li>\n	<li>the hippie girl from the bus who is just a bit off into dream world all the time, \n	and prefers to play and explore &#34;nice&#34; things rather than facing hard facts.</li>\n</ul></p><p><h2>Sorting the goodies</h2></p><p><p>Then we use another paper and sort the things we want to have online into \ncategories, and, if necessary, into sub categories. Once that is done, let's sort \nthem by priority.</p></p><p><p>If the things are long and hard to read, let's think of shorter names for them.</p> </p><p><p>Let's go through the list of things and think hard if they really need to be \nthere, or if they are a &#34;nice to have&#34; which can be added later or after we \nsaw how successful the other bits are. Let's take these &#34;nice to have&#34;s and put \nthem on another paper crossing them out on the first one, or - if we have the \nprofessional version of <em>pen</em> - use the end opposite of the point to erase them.</p> \n<p>Let's sit back, take a sip of coffee or tea, or do something different for a while, \ncome back and have another go at moving things to the &#34;maybe later&#34; paper.</p></p><p><p>Alright, we have a list of what we want to have. Now let's take \nanother paper and think what our visitors (the doodles, remember?) need\nor expect to reach them.</p></p><p><h2>Catering for the masses</h2></p><p><ul>\n	<li>The fast business executive doesn't have the time to figure out the \n	navigation (even when it only takes some seconds) - her first goal will be \n	to find a search functionality, that really leads to results. If she can't \n	find it, or the results are meaningless, we lost her.</li>\n	<li>The lady with the thick glasses might have trouble reading text and \n	navigation online and therefore has the biggest font setting, let's make \n	sure she can read our navigation, and her big fonts don't mess up our \n	design. This also means we cannot use a graphical navigation, as not all \n	browsers allow for magnification of images, and she might not care for \n	upgrading her browser - this takes too long and is too complex to do.</li>\n	<li>The computer geek wants to see what you got and take part, he is likely \n	to register to be able to give comments and take part and give his piece of \n	mind about your work.</li>\n	<li>Auntie should be considered when we think about the navigation, \n	looking around the web, we might have seen loads of cool multi-level drop \n	down navigations, but with that shaking hand in mind, they become not so hot \n	an idea out of a sudden. </li>\n	<li>The hippie girl wants nice colours and see things change when she does \n	something. Roll-overs might still be a nice and new thing to her, and they \n	don't hurt to add.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's write down some of these assumptions.</p></p><p><h2>Moving on</h2></p><p><p>Alright, this is where we got to. The powerfull application "pen" gave us so far:</p></p><p><ul>\n	<li>A site map of all the pages we want to create, already sorted into \n	categories, which translates to a navigation concept.</li>\n	<li>A wish list of the elements we should include into the page to make all \n	of the possible visitors we care about happy. </li>\n</ul></p><p><p>Bear in mind that we do not have to give them all the same experience, if our \nweb site will offer newest stock market trends, we don't have to cater a lot \nto the glasses lady, Auntie or the hippie girl.</p>\n<p>A web site about game mods and cheats might not really give Auntie or \nthe busy business executive, or even the hippie girl, a kick.</p>\n<p>One thing we don't want though is become elitist and block them out. Give them \nwhat they can use, and enhance for our target audience, is what we want.</p></p><p><h2>Re-entering the digital world</h2></p><p><p>Now we turn on the computer, and we start our web product. With what? With a \nfolder called "my_website" or something similar. In this folder we create \nfolders with the names of our navigation elements, and the neccessary subfolders.</p></p><p><p>Now we take a text editor, doesn't really matter which - as long as it is capable\nof clean text and is portable to various platforms - and start writing the \ncontent of each of the pages we want to create. Let's sort the text into \nheadlines, lists and paragraphs, and if we need an image for the content, put \nthat image into the appropriate folder. </p></p><p><p>Close the text, get a bagel or another coffee, walk the dog or take a breath \nof fresh air. Come back and delete as much as you could. Remember, users don't \nread, they <em>scan</em> on the web. Don't smother them with long winded talk, get to the\npoint.</p></p><p><p>Ok, we are prepared and ready. We can start our web site, with our favourite \neditor and graphical environment. We can start designing the pages, choose the\nnavigation (left hand, left hand and horizontal, horizontal, tabs, right hand...)\nand create the pages. Personally I like using includes in PHP, but if you want \nto use something else or create each page by hand, do that.</p> </p><p><p>The <em>pen</em> helped us a lot in finding, sorting and honing what we want to put \non the web, a lot faster and cheaper than trial and error in any fancy web\ndevelopment package. It helped us avoiding flashy traps that might have annoyed \na lot of users. And we were able to do that anytime and anywhere.</p></p><p><p>It also enables people who don't know how to create web sites to prepare the \ncontent for the web developers in a clean way, no searching through hundreds\nof emails or copying and pasting from one word file.</p></p><p><p>Surely the mightiest web development tool of them all.</p>
