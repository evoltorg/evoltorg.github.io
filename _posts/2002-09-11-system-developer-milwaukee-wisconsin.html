When he\'s not slaving away over his PowerBook, he enjoys cooking for his girlfriend; shouting at the hooligans in his building to please, for the love of god, would you shut the hell up for one night, just one night; and laying a severe beating upon <a href=\"http://www.evolt.org/user/djc/5/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">djc</a>, <a href=\"http://www.evolt.org/user/Chump/12192/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">chump</a>, and whoever else wants a piece of him at the greatest game ever created: <a href=\"http://boardgames.about.com/cs/risk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Risk</a>. He also likes really, really, really long run-on sentences.<br><br>
He is to be both feared and respected.<br><br>
