They are quite simple to write, once you understand the format and their production cost is very little or nothing. If you are a writer, you should investigate writing Ebooks. After writing the Ebook and setting up the sales page, you can generate profits for years. Of course you need to promote it. But, if you are skilled at SEO techniques and have a good affiliate plan, the search engines along with your affiliates will bring you plenty of traffic. Here are some easy techniques that generate Ebook profits: </p><p>Interesting Ebooks that offer important information related to your target market. Be exact, targeted titles sell much better than general topics. For example, an Ebook entitled, How to Cook, might generate 1 sale per month. But a targeted Eebook called, How to prepare strong and Easy 10 Minute Meals might get 20 sales per month. </p><p>  \nBuild and promote your own domain.

Promote your sales page in forums by including a link in your signature file. I usually recommend registering with 4 or 5 forums and entering 8 posts a day on each one. This will bring you plenty of traffic. </p><p>Article marketing is also a very useful technique to promote your Ebook. Include a link in your resource box that directs people to your Ebook. This technique has the added benefit of positioning you as an expert in the field. </p><p>Look for advertisers that can help you promote your Ebooks and your website.
