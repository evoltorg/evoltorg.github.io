<p>According to the <a href="http://www.colormarketing.org" target="_new" title="Color Marketing Group">Color Marketing Group</a>, blue will be the most important color for the new century, also a choice of neutral colors in cool and warm grey, earthy brown colors, brownish grey and light brown.</p></p><p><P>Also a trend for soft and bright colors, lead by greenish aqua and deep lavender, as an answer to consumers who wish for 'happy clearness' in their environment.</p></p><p><P>But consumer goods of the next century also need energetic colors, to balance the blue and neutral tones. Stimulating orange tones, red tones and golden-brown tones from Marocco and Australia close the gap.</p></p><p><P>The members identified four color groups as being important in the next century:</p></p><p><ul></p><li><i>Techno-Colors</i>:  From grey through black and true white, from a technical background. </p><li><i>Chromatic Adrenaline Colors</i>:  Energy filled shadowings, to brighten up color combinations and give products "speed". </p><li><i>Serenity Colors</i>:  Colors satisfying customers who wish for harmony in life; bright, soft and relaxing. Natural and mostly inspired by water. <li><i>Mediterranean Culture Colors</i>: Earth tones.</p></ul> </p><p><p>More information about CMG's <a href="http://www.colormarketing.org/cmg/pr092298.htm" target="_new" title="CMG Press Release">Consumer Color Directions?
