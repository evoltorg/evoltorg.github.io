ColdFusion's comment tags can be nested.  \nThis isn't documented in Allaire's CFDOCS, \nin fact the only reference to CF comments \nI could find is in \n<b>Chapter 4 Quick Start to ColdFusion - Creating Simple Dynamic Pages</b> --\n<blockquote>\nNote the use of the comment convention used in ColdFusion pages: \n&lt;!--- and ---&gt;. ColdFusion comments use a form similar to HTML \ncomments, but with an additional hyphen. \n</blockquote>\nWell, this isn't <i>exactly</i> true unless\nyou interpret the word "similar" loosely.  \nUnlike CF comments,\nHTML comments are cannot be nested.\n<p>\nFor example, consider the following block of HTML\n<blockquote>\nthis is uncommented HTML<br>\n&lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;<br>\nthis again is uncommented<br>\n&lt;!-- this is another comment --&gt;<br>\nfinally, this too is uncommented\n</blockquote>\nIf you have ever tried to comment out an entire\nblock of HTML like the above, you will\nhave quickly discovered that \nyou can not just slap opening\nand closing comment tags around the\nblock --\n<blockquote>\n<font color="#CC0000"><b>&lt;!-- open my comment</b></font><br>\nthis is uncommented<br>\n&lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;<br>\nthis again is uncommented<br>\n&lt;!-- this is another comment --&gt;<br>\nfinally, this too is uncommented<br>\n<font color="#CC0000"><b>close my comment --&gt;</b></font>\n</blockquote>\nThe above will <em>not</em>\ngive the intended results, because the opening &lt;!-- tag\nwill be matched by the first --&gt; tag encountered, despite the\nfact that there was a nested &lt;!-- between them.\n<p>\nCold Fusion comments, however, <em>can be nested</em>, and the \nfollowing <em>will</em>\ngive the intended results --\n<blockquote>\n<font color="#0000CC"><b>&lt;!--- open my CF comment</b></font><br>\nthis is uncommented<br>\n&lt;!--- this is a CF comment ---&gt;<br>\nthis again is uncommented<br>\n&lt;!--- this is another CF comment ---&gt;<br>\nfinally, this too is uncommented<br>\n<font color="#0000CC"><b>close my CF comment ---&gt;</b></font>\n</blockquote>\nEverything between the\n<font color="#0000CC"><b>&lt;!---</b></font>\nand \n<font color="#0000CC"><b>---&gt;</b></font>\nis one large CF comment, and none of it will be passed to\nthe web server by Cold Fusion.\n<p>\nNeat, eh?
