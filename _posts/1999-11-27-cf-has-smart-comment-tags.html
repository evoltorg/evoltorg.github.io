ColdFusion's comment tags can be nested.  </p>This isn't documented in Allaire's CFDOCS, </p>in fact the only reference to CF comments </p>I could find is in </p><b>Chapter 4 Quick Start to ColdFusion - Creating Simple Dynamic Pages</b> --</p><blockquote></p>Note the use of the comment convention used in ColdFusion pages: </p>&lt;!--- and ---&gt;. ColdFusion comments use a form similar to HTML </p>comments, but with an additional hyphen. </p></blockquote></p>Well, this isn't <i>exactly</i> true unless</p>you interpret the word "similar" loosely.  </p>Unlike CF comments,</p>HTML comments are cannot be nested.</p><p></p>For example, consider the following block of HTML</p><blockquote></p>this is uncommented HTML<br></p>&lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;<br></p>this again is uncommented<br></p>&lt;!-- this is another comment --&gt;<br></p>finally, this too is uncommented</p></blockquote></p>If you have ever tried to comment out an entire</p>block of HTML like the above, you will</p>have quickly discovered that </p>you can not just slap opening</p>and closing comment tags around the</p>block --</p><blockquote></p><font color="#CC0000"><b>&lt;!-- open my comment</b></font><br></p>this is uncommented<br></p>&lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;<br></p>this again is uncommented<br></p>&lt;!-- this is another comment --&gt;<br></p>finally, this too is uncommented<br></p><font color="#CC0000"><b>close my comment --&gt;</b></font></p></blockquote></p>The above will <em>not</em></p>give the intended results, because the opening &lt;!-- tag</p>will be matched by the first --&gt; tag encountered, despite the</p>fact that there was a nested &lt;!-- between them.</p><p></p>Cold Fusion comments, however, <em>can be nested</em>, and the </p>following <em>will</em></p>give the intended results --</p><blockquote></p><font color="#0000CC"><b>&lt;!--- open my CF comment</b></font><br></p>this is uncommented<br></p>&lt;!--- this is a CF comment ---&gt;<br></p>this again is uncommented<br></p>&lt;!--- this is another CF comment ---&gt;<br></p>finally, this too is uncommented<br></p><font color="#0000CC"><b>close my CF comment ---&gt;</b></font></p></blockquote></p>Everything between the</p><font color="#0000CC"><b>&lt;!---</b></font></p>and </p><font color="#0000CC"><b>---&gt;</b></font></p>is one large CF comment, and none of it will be passed to</p>the web server by Cold Fusion.</p><p></p>Neat, eh?
