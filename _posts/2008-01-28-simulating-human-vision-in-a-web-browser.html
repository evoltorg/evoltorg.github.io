excerpt: "he Scrutinizer allows you to inspect a design, or have a user try to use it.  It reveals the degree to which your visual design supports direct access of elements -- if the element is visible in the blur & desaturated periphery it's available for direct access by the eye.  For observing users, the Scrutinizer slows the user's eye movements down so you can more reliably detect what content they've engaged with.</p>"
