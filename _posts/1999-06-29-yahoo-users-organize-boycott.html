Angry users of both Yahoo and Geocities are <a href="http://www.sitepowerup.com/boycottyahoo/boycottyahoo.htm" target="_new">boycotting</a> the two after it came out in the Yahoo Terms of Service that any content one has on GeoCities or any other of Yahoo's properties is theirs to use, royalty free, forever.<P> This sounds like some pretty serious stuff, and if I was a person who hosted with geocities, I would be enraged as well.. It also reminds me of <a href="http://www.wired.com" target="_new">another company</a> that tried to pull the same stunt.
