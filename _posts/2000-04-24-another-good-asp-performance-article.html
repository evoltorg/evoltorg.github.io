I hate to admit it, but <b>Microsoft</b> has a pretty darn good <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/voices/server03272000.asp" target="_new">ASP Performance Article</a> that focuses not on specific     ASP code, but rather on different techniques related to ASP (such as storing Scripting.Dictionary objects in the Application object (bad thing) and caching HTML results in the Application object (good thing)). Check it out, then thank me for finding it for you :-)
