<p><acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> and </p><acronym title="eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> have given tables a pretty rough ride in recent times. Of course, </p>  this is the fault of just about all web developers who have at some point in </p>  their career used them for laying out page elements. This article is not about </p>  using tables for layout. It is about how to use tables to display information </p>  in an accessible manner. Use <acronym title="eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</acronym></p>   and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> all you want for layout, but at the </p>  end of the day (if there is one on the internet) so long as there are informational </p>  relationships there will be tables. In fact, to attempt to display any of complex </p>  information relationships without a table is a mistake. If you have information </p>  to display, use tables and use them well. </p></p><h2>Table Basics</h2></p><p>If I create a plan of what I intended to achieve yesterday and place it in a table, to a sighted </p>  user it can be a great aid:</p></p><p><table width="100%"  border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" summary="This table compares what I should do today, with what I would like to do and what I actually did."></p>  <caption></p>  Today's action plan: </p>  </caption></p>  <tr> </p>    <th width="10%" id="h1"><strong>Time</strong></th></p>    <th width="31%" id="h2" abbr="planned"><strong>Planned Task</strong></th></p>    <th width="27%" id="h3" abbr="preffered"><strong>Preferred Task</strong></th></p>    <th width="32%" id="h4" abbr="actual"><strong>What I actually did</strong></th></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td headers="h1">10 - 12</td></p>    <td headers="h2">Catch up on replying to my emails.</td></p>    <td headers="h3">Have a lie in.</td></p>    <td headers="h4">Surfed aimlessly.</td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr></p>    <td headers="h1">12-1</td></p>    <td headers="h2">Have Lunch.</td></p>    <td headers="h3">Have Lunch.</td></p>    <td headers="h4">Had Breakfast.</td></p>  </tr></p>  <tr> </p>    <td headers="h1">1-5</td></p>    <td headers="h2">Finish that project. </td></p>    <td headers="h3">Go to video store.</td></p>    <td headers="h4">Caught up on my emails.</td></p>  </tr></p></table></p><p>Blind and other severely vision impaired users rely on assistive technologies </p>  to render web content. All text can be fed through a screen reader or refreshable </p>  braille display to be presented to the user. However, despite containing text, </p>  the table above could make a real mess of things without a few extra behind </p>  the scenes accessibility enhancements. To an assistive browser our table could </p>  well look like this:</p></p><blockquote>Time Planned Task Preferred Task What I actually did<br></p>  10 - 12 Catch up on replying to my emails. Have a lie in. Surfed aimlessly.<br></p>  12-1 Have Lunch. Have Lunch. Had Breakfast.<br></p>  1-5 Finish that project. Go to video store. Caught up on my emails.</blockquote></p><p>Ok, we can still kind of make a little sense of it. That is because we can see it. A blind </p>  user can't easily scan back up and check what the third piece of information </p>  relates to. Was it what I actually did, or what I would have preferred to do? </p>  This is why we need to create relationships within the code of our table. Thankfully, </p>  from <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language version 4">HTML4.0</acronym> a </p>  bucketful of accessibility enhancements were introduced to enable </p>  the conscientious developer to do this.</p></p><p>Before we see how this is done let's go back to first grade. A table is created </p>  with a table element. Everything in the table is contained between <code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</code>. </p>  Beneath this we can place rows with the <code>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</code> element. Each </p>  row can have any number of cells using the <code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</code>. Rows can alternatively </p>  contain the header element, <code>&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;</code>, which we will see are basically </p>  fancy cells with allow us to add turbo-charged accessibility to our table.</p></p><p>Phew, you are still here.</p></p><h2>Explaining Our Table</h2></p><p>The first thing we should include in any table is a caption and a summary. </p>  The caption will be visible to all users, the summary is a bit of hidden code </p>  for special browsers. The caption comes right under the opening table tag:</p></p><p> <code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;caption&gt;Today's action plan: &lt;/caption&gt;...</code></p></p><p>It should provide the user with a succinct and straight to the point description </p>  of the table's content. The caption will be rendered on the screen when your </p>  document is accessed so keep it simple but coherent.</p></p><p>The summary is a place to guide non-visual agents and is an attribute taken </p>  by the opening table tag. Here you can describe the table in a bit more detail </p>  especially with regards to structure:</p></p><p><code>&lt;table summary =&quot;This table charts my activities for the day </p>  based on three criteria for each of three periods of the day: What I was supposed </p>  to so; what I would have preferred to do and what I actually did. &quot;&gt;...</code></p></p><p>Our table makes much more sense now to a blind user. Actually, she can probably </p>  figure out what it should look like. Many visually impaired users actually prefer </p>  to be labeled &quot;vision impaired&quot;. Just because they can't see, it doesn't </p>  mean they can't visualize! Another point to keep in mind is that the summary </p>  attribute is not rendered on screen, so we can have the time of our life with </p>  it. We just need to make sure that what we write in there is relevant and provides </p>  assistance. Don't write all of the table data in there, just describe the relationship </p>  of data in the table. </p></p><h2>Relationship advice.</h2></p><p>Now we know what our table is about, we need to show the browser how information </p>  is related. This will help us overcome the problem of of information being rendered </p>  in continuous and seemingly unstructured lines. This is where we go to work </p>  with our table headers. The table above has 4 cells (or columns) per row, so </p>  we will need to add 4 headers to show what these columns represent. The best </p>  place for headers is in our first row, right below the &lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt; </p>  element:</p></p><p>Here is what it looks like for the table above: </p></p><pre>&lt;tr&gt;</p>  &lt;th id=&quot;h1&quot;&gt;<strong>Time</strong>.&lt;/th&gt;</p>  &lt;th id=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;<strong>Planned Task</strong>&lt;/th&gt;</p>  &lt;th id=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;<strong>Preferred Task</strong>.&lt;/th&gt;</p>  &lt;th id=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;<strong>What I actually did.</strong>&lt;/th&gt;</p>&lt;/tr&gt;</pre></p><p>Notice that each &lt;td&gt; tag has taken an attribute called id which has </p>  a unique identifier. I will show you now how we use these unique identifiers </p>  to create relationships for the information in our table, and what the outcome </p>  is. We now need to link all of our columns containing the data to their appropriate </p>  header. Look how easy this is by looking at the first row of data from the table </p>  above:</p></p><pre>&lt;tr&gt;</p>  &lt;td headers=&quot;h1&quot;&gt;10 - 12&lt;/td&gt;</p>  &lt;td headers=&quot;h2&quot;&gt;Catch up on replying to my emails.&lt;/td&gt;</p>  &lt;td headers=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Have a lie in.&lt;/td&gt;</p>  &lt;td headers=&quot;h4&quot;&gt;Surfed aimlessly.&lt;/td&gt;</p>&lt;/tr&gt;</pre></p>  <p></p>  What we have done here is created a link between a piece of information and </p>  its header by incorporating a headers attribute into each cell that refers to </p>  the relevant id we created in our <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> id attribute. All we need to do </p>  is make sure we include the same references in every row we create in our table. </p>  So its not even difficult to achieve with dynamic output from a scripted page </p>  such as one produced with <acronym title="Active Server Pages">asp</acronym> or</p>  <acronym title="Pre-hypertext Processor">php</acronym>. But what does all that extra stuff do. </p>  The best way to explain is to show you how a screen reader would deal with that </p>  information. Here is the output for our example row as seen by a screen reader:</p></p><p><strong>Time:</strong> 10 -12<br></p>  <strong>Planned task:</strong> Catch up on replying to my emails.<br></p>  <strong>Preferred Task:</strong> Have a lie in.<br></p>  <strong>What I actually did: </strong>Surfed aimlessly<strong>.</strong></p></p><p>...and so on for every row of data we have. To a sighted user, it may seem </p>  a drag that every piece of data is proceeded by its header. To a blind or vision</p>  impaired user it can be the only way to keep track of a relationships in a complex </p>  set of data. If your headers are made up of quite long information, this can </p>  be quite a nuisance, but there is also a way to deal with this. Your headers </p>  can also take on an abbr attribute where you type in an abbreviated reference </p>  to your header title. here is an example using our table's headers:</p></p><pre>&lt;tr&gt;</p>  &lt;th id=&quot;h1&quot;&gt;<strong>Time</strong>.&lt;/th&gt;</p>  &lt;th id=&quot;h2&quot; abbr=&quot;planned&quot;&gt;<strong>Planned Task</strong>&lt;/th&gt;</p>  &lt;th id=&quot;h3&quot; abbr=&quot;preferred&quot;&gt;<strong>Preferred Task</strong>.&lt;/th&gt;</p>  &lt;th id=&quot;h4&quot; abbr=&quot;actual&quot;&gt;<strong>What I actually did.</strong>&lt;/th&gt;</p>&lt;/tr&gt;</pre></p><p>The cool thing about this is that on its first pass, the reader will render </p>  the full header, then for every subsequent row of data it will only read out </p>  the abbreviated value for the header. This gives the user a reference point </p>  without having to listen to the full header at every cell. </p></p><h2>Digging Deeper</h2></p><p>Before I close up here,I will mention that <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language version 4">HTML4.0</acronym> </p>  also introduced an axis attribute which is still to gain support amongst many </p>  assistive technologies. The axis attribute is to help explain more complex informational </p>  structures and if you want to take a look into it you will see that it is well </p>  outside the scope of this article.On close inspection the axis attribute also </p>  looks suitable for more complex data mining as well as accessibility - once </p>  the technology is in place. For more information about the axis attribute read </p>  the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html#adef-axis">w3 </p>  recommendations for tables</a>. In the meantime I hope you find these simple </p>  techniques for making your tables accessible of use and start implementing them </p>  into your own sites.</p>
