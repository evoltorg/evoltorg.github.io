<p>\nNow that the <a href="http://www.webreference.com/dhtml/hiermenus/" target="_new" title="Opens in new window.">Webreference \n  Hierarchical menus</a> have gone commercial, it is time for some of us to consider \n  good alternatives for developing those DHTML drop-down menus.\n</p></p><p><p>\nIn this quick \n  posting (hesitate to dignify this as an &quot;article&quot;), I will share some \n  options from my stash, with some relevant preliminary comments. This is not supposed to \n  be <em>TheGreatComparisonOfMenuScripts</em>  or a comprehensive rehash of search results from \n  Google... it is just a listing of possible options that I have accumulated on \n  my local drive. Hope this is useful.\n</p></p><p><p>\nBefore we begin, I have tested these menu scripts with the following <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org" target="_new" title="Click to see a listing of browsers, from evolt.org; opens in new window.">browsers</a> \n using a Windows XP build 2600 and a Windows 2000 box &#8212;\n</p></p><p><ul>\n  <li>IE 4x - 6x</li>\n  <li>Netscape 4.77</li>\n  <li>Netscape 6.2</li>\n  <li>Mozilla 0.9.8 (Mozilla/5.0; Gecko/20020204)</li>\n  <li>Opera 6.01 Build 1014</li>\n</ul></p><p>\n<p>Ok, here's the list:</p></p><p><table cellspacing="0" class="data">\n  <tr valign="top"> \n    <th>Name</th>\n    <th>Sample</th>\n    <th>Browsers it works with</th>\n    <th>Remarks</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr> \n    <td><a target="_new"  href="http://www.milonic.com" title="Opens in new window.">Milonic</a></td>\n    <td><a target="_new"  href="http://www.milonic.com" title="Opens in new window.">Get code</a></td>\n    <td>All tested.</td>\n    <td>This one is perhaps the simplest to start coding with, appears the same in all browsers, and has a cool fading effect.
