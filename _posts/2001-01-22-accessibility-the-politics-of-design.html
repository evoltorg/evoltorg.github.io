excerpt: "In the United States the Rules for building websites have changed. A little over a year ago I posted an article on Accessibility here. This is a follow up to that article with implications for all web design, not just government sites."

<p></p> A little over a year ago I wrote an <a</p>href="/article/Accessibility_The_Clock_is_Ticking/4090/485/index.html/"</p>title="Accessibility, the clock is ticking">article here</a>  on the upcoming</p><A href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html"</p>target="_blank">U.S. Accessibility Regulations</A> for the web. Section 508</p>of the WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998, which required all United</p>States Federal Agencies, with websites, to have them accessible to</p>individuals with disabilities, within 24 months of</p>enacting of this law.</p></p></p><p></p>The <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/news/508-final.htm"</p>target="_blank" title="Final Standards">Regulations</a> are finally out and</p>the clock has started ticking again. </p></p></p><p></p>"<cite>But I don't work for the government,</cite>" you cry!  Probably true.</p>But the impact of these regulations will extend far beyond the .gov domain.</p>If you work for a University or other .edu that takes federal grants and</p>have a website, surprise! It's gonna be your day in the barrel</p>too.</p></p></p><p></p>One of the lesser known provisions of the The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the <STRONG><I>"effective communication rule"</I></STRONG></p></p><p>In a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/foia/cltr204.txt" target="_blank">Letter</a> dated September 9, 1996, to Sen. Tom Harkin, Deval L. Patrick, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division had this to say, </p></p><blockquote>"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires State and</p>local governments and places of public accommodation to furnish</p>appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure</p>effective communication with individuals with disabilities,</p>unless doing so would result in a fundamental alteration to the</p>program or service or in an undue burden.  28 C.F.R. . 36.303; 28</p>C.F.R. . 35.160.  Auxiliary aids include taped texts, Brailled</p>materials, large print materials, and other methods of making</p>visually delivered material available to people with visual</p>impairments."</blockquote></p><blockquote>"Covered entities under the ADA are required to provide</p>effective communication, regardless of whether they generally</p>communicate through print media, audio media, or computerized</p>media such as the Internet.  Covered entities that use the</p>Internet for communications regarding their programs, goods, or</p>services must be prepared to offer those communications through</p>accessible means as well."</blockquote></p><p></p>This letter  suddenly expanded the rules to include State and local</p>government websites. It also opens the door for interpretation of</p>accessibility claims against commercial websites. If you have a .com that</p>does business with the government, you may need to determine if these</p>regulations apply to you. Lots of sites, Lots of Lawyers, connect the</p>dots.</p></p></p><p></p>This is Good  News. Some of you are currently unemployed. The implosion</p>of the pure play dot.com websites, has with the arrival of these</p>regulations,  presents a golden opportunity for new jobs. A lot of new jobs.</p>Before sending out those resumes, let's look at what work the government has</p>done.</p></p></p><h2>Uncle Sam Needs YOU</h2></p><p></p>The regulations gave the enforcement authority to the Department Of</p>Justice. On April 2, 1999, the Attorney General<a</p>href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/memohead.html" target="_blank"> issued a</p>memorandum</a> to the heads of all Federal agencies advising them of the</p>requirements of Section 508 and providing instructions for conducting</p>self-evaluations of their electronic and information technology.</p></p></p><p></p>The United States Government has over <a href="http://www.firstgov.gov"</p>target="_blank" title="First Gov. The US Government Portal ">20,000</a></p>websites. <br>3,028 Web <strong>pages</strong> were surveyed.  </p></p></p><p></p>This effort on the part of the DOJ although representing a small sample</p>was a good faith effort to measure compliance and to give a heads up on</p>these regulations. </p></p></p><p></p>This information was collected, collated and presented in a report. On</p>July 22, 1999 the Justice Department released <a</p>href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/report/web.htm" target="_blank">this</p>report</a> on the state of Federal Websites.  This report pointed out that a</p>number of tools and technologies currently in use for disseminating</p>information on the taxpayers dime are not accessible.</p></p></p><p></p><a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/report/web.htm#N_4_" target="_blank"</p>title="Government Accessibility Report">Note 4</a> of this report states:</p></p></p><blockquote>"4. The Department was careful to limit the degree and</p>scope of conclusions drawn from the data provided by agencies, for the</p>simple reason that many of the components appeared to misunderstand some of</p>the questions. Spot-checks conducted by the Department of the Web sites --</p>the URL's of which were reported on the survey forms -- revealed that many</p>of them did not contain the features the components identified them as</p>containing. For instance, 592 Web pages were identified as containing</p>"applets." The Department, after reviewing a majority of these</p>pages, did not find a single applet in a spot-check of most of</p>them."</blockquote></p><blockquote>"There are many possible explanations for this observation.</p>It is possible that as components identified accessibility problems with</p>certain types of features (e.g., applets), they deleted the offending</p>features from their Web pages rather than making them accessible. It is more</p>likely, however, that many of those who evaluated Web pages were not</p>sufficiently careful or knowledgeable to correctly identify features of</p>their Web pages." </blockquote></p><p></p> Taken to task in the presentation arena were Java applets, imagemaps,</p>Microsoft PowerPoint and Adobe Acrobat .pdf files</p></p></p><p></p>While robust, Java applets have a number of issues which, in order to</p>present accessible information, makes their use problematic.</p>Imagemaps with the correct use of alt-tags present less of a</p>challenge, but require thought. PowerPoint presentations are severely</p>limited by not only accessibility concerns, but also by requiring a</p>copy of PowerPoint to view.</p></p></p><p></p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/main.html"</p>target="_blank">Adobe</a> is  one of the major players for tools that are</p>used daily across the world for building websites.  Adobe's Portable</p>Document Format is one of the  most robust document formats. It gave</p>What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get or "WYSIWYG" real meaning.</p> It is a very good format for presenting information considered final, which</p>is why it used extensively for legal documents. That's the good news.</p></p></p><p></p> On July 22, 1999, the Department of Education issued an overall agency</p>report. This report summarized the accessibility challenges faced by</p>agencies which choose to put documents in Adobe Acrobat's pdf format:</p></p></p><blockquote>The Portable Document Format (PDF) has provided one of the most</p>controversial</p>accessibility problems of the decade.  PDF documents, by the nature of the</p>medium, are portable, cross-platform, generally tamper-proof, and render in</p>exacting detail, representations of the original print document's fonts,</p>formatting,</p>etc.</blockquote></p><p></p>According to the Justice Department report:</p></p></p><blockquote>"17. Recently, in a presentation to federal agency</p>officials and employees, representatives from Adobe explained that their</p>newly released version of Adobe Acrobat included many accessibility features</p>that, if used correctly, could be used to create files that were easily</p>accessible to users with disabilities. Adobe's Accessibility Seminar, Feb.</p>2, 2000, IRS Building. Word processed documents that are "printed"</p>to pdf instead of "scanned" to pdf are much more likely to work</p>well with Adobe's access utility. <em><strong>Adobe clarified that it sees</p>its job as simply to provide the tools for making accessible files, not to</p>teach users how to use these tools to make files more accessible."</p></strong></em>(My Emphasis)</blockquote></p><p align="right"><a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/report/content.htm"</p>target="_blank">Information Technology and People with Disabilities:<br></p>The Current State of Federal Accessibility April 2000</a></p></p><p></p>The government has done its homework. </p></p></p><p></p>A private report came out in September: Assessing E-Government: The</p>Internet, Democracy, and Service Delivery by State and Federal</p>Governments.<br></p>This is the executive summary:</p></p></p><ol></p> <li>only 5 percent of government websites show some form of security</p>policy and 7 percent have a privacy policy</li></p> <li>15 percent of government websites offer some form of disability</p>access, such as TTY (Text Telephone) or TDD (Telephone Device for the Deaf)</p>or are approved by disability organizations.</li></p> <li>4 percent offer foreign language translation features on their</p>websites</li></p> <li>22 percent of government websites offer at least one online</p>service</li></p> <li>a few of the sites are starting to offer commercial advertising,</p>which raises problematic issues for the public sector</li></p> <li>91 percent of the sites responded to a sample email requesting the</p>official office hours of the particular agency and three-quarters did so</p>within one business day </li></p> <li>states vary enormously in their overall ranking based on our</p>analysis.

Which in some cases is a   magnificent collection of the finest</p>hardware and software available. But  the best tools on the market will not</p>guarantee accessible code or design.

Your job just got a lot harder.</p>"I'm not using Java, javascripting, DHTML, Flash or Quicktime"</p>you cry!  "I don't need but a handfull of tags!"</p></p></p><p></p><strong>POP QUIZ!</strong><br>How many browsers support <code><accesskey></code>?</p></p></p><p></p>Welcome to browser hell. There are three major visual browsers, Internet</p>Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and Opera. None of these allow you to use the</p>entire range of accessibility tags. Nor is the support for the usable ones</p>consistent. Platform dependancy create rendering issues.  Lynx is a text</p>browser. Limited formatting and no  visuals allowed here. Screen Readers</p>require a whole new mindset in respect to using tables for presenting</p>content.</p></p></p><p></p><strong>Testing, Testing, Testing.</strong><br>You can build the cleanest</p>pages possible and validate them, but unless you test them in every browser</p>you can get your hands on and get your friends who work in different</p>environments to test them, you will not be sure.</p></p></p><p></p>Building valid websites is easy. Building compliant websites is hard. You</p>have to make  conscious decisions to include text browsers, screen readers,</p>and aural information. Cascading Style Sheet support is such a mess that</p>zeldman has 1, 2, 3, 4 articles devoted to what you <em>can't</em> use. </p></p></p><p></p>If you build websites  for the goverment, you will probably get a big</p>manual with chapter and verse. </p></p></p><p></p>If you build websites for business, sooner or later the folks whose money</p>you took will probably get a email from someone who wants to buy your</p>clients stuff, but can't because you made a decision not to make their site</p>accessible.</p></p></p><p></p>These regulations point to a  new era of website development.</p>Accessibility in website design is not a  crisis  of confidence, it is a</p>challenge to your creativity, knowlege, and ability to create a web for</p>everyone. Governments will do it, because it is our tax dollar. Companies</p>will do it because it is a bottom line issue. You will do it because you</p>love a challenge.</p></p></p><h2>Further Reading</h2></p><p></p><a href="http://www.alistapart.zeldman.com/stories/ticking/"</p>title="Accessibility the clock is ticking" target="_blank">Accessibility the clock is</p>ticking</a><br><A</p>href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html" target="_blank">WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT OF</p>1998</A><BR></p><A</p>href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/foia/cltr204.txt" target="_blank">Effective Communication</p>Rule</A><br></p><A href="http://www.access-board.gov/pubs/eitaacrpt.htm" target="_blank">EITAAC</p>Report</A><BR></p><A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/" target="_blank">Web Content</p>Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</A><BR></p><A</p>href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS/" target="_blank">W3C 'Authoring Tool Accessibility</p>Guidelines'</A><BR></p><A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/" target="_blank">W3C 'User</p>Agent</p>Accessibility Guidelines'</A><BR></p><A href="http://www.evolt.org//article/Accessibility_more_than_the_right_thing_to_do/4090/381/index.html"></p>Accessibility: more than the right thing to do</A><BR></p></p></p><p></p>A special thanks to Marlene Bruce for editing help.<br></p>This article originally appeared at <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a>.</p></p>
