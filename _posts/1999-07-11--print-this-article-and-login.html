I'd like to have a "Print this article." option.\nThere are so many new and really good tutorials at evolt.org that I'd like to have handy although I'm offline. Okay, that wasn't a real argument, but anyway a tutorial in offline-usage just looks better without the complete navbar stuff.</p><p>Oh, and the login link should be placed a little bit higher in the menu.\nA persisent login as already suggested would be really great (and you could leave the link where it is).
