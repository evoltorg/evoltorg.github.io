Everyone reading this article probably surfs around the net. Some sites that come up they like, whether they have relavent info or not. Others, they know look horrible and don't really want to wade through the mess to find what they are looking for.</p><p>And through this surfing we all accumlate some of our 'favorite sites'. Now, it would be great if we could have a category for 'Favorite Sites' that could be broken down into different sub categories: Best Organized, Best Aesthetics, Most Interactive..ect. </p><p>This would really help us all when we are in that design slump and just can't get out of it.
