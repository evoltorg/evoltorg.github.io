excerpt: "After 2 years of world search engine domination it seems that Google may have a new challenger in a beta-bot named Teoma."

<p>It seems that after 2 years of web dominance since <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="The little search engine that got big - opens in a new window">Google's</a> first appearance</p>as a beta project at Stanford University, the lovable little blighter faces a </p>challenger.</p></p><h3>Enter Teoma</h3></p><p><A href="http://www.teoma.com" target="_blank" title="Teoma Search Engine - Opens in a New Window">Teoma</A>, currently in beta testing, </p>has already been supplying results to <A href="http://www.ask.co.uk/">AskJeeves</A> for a while now with a positive response. A spokesman for Teoma indicated that he was interested in taking</p>Teoma down the independent route like Google and not just to use it as a backend search </p>supplying the 'big boys'.</p></p><p><h3>How it works</h3></p><p>Teoma does not work quite like Google. Rather than using a "Page Rank" structure to</p>decide what is relevant, it collects together (in realtime) a set of all of the pages</p>on the web containing the relevant key words. Teoma then performs a 'community' analysis</p>on them, finding out how the pages link architectures relate to each other and decides their importance. After all, </p>the web does not operate on how many inward links you get, it operates on millions of interlinking related communities.</p></p><p><p><em>For example:</em> Lets say we search for "web development". Teoma finds all pages containing those keywords. Now, imagine that all of the pages have a link to <A href="http://www.evolt.org/" target="_blank" title="You're already here.">evolt.org</A>.</p>This suggests to Teoma that it is something of an authority in the world of "web development" and thus we get a high ranking.</p></p><p><p>Teoma also provides a nice folder system for categorising sub-groups of sites which are relevant to your search... so our search for "web development" may turf out sub-folders such as "backend" "web design" "tools" etc...</p></p><p><p>The lack of dependence on volume of links is also good news for honest coders since it means that the popular practice of google link spamming may become obsolete.</p>
