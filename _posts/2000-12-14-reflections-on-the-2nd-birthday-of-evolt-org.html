<p>I feel very lucky for having met this wonderful group of people "just in the right minute". I'm a Comunicologist and Graphic Designer, and I'm interested in the Web as a human phenomenon and a tool that will give us the ability to change the way our civilization works.</p></p><p>Once I decided to work in this, I needed to learn HTML. Luckily i met the monkeyjunkies, and just when I was starting to get familiar with these guys, our guerilla gig started. From the beginning, I saw the future of our project very optimistically, I knew it was a great idea and that we had the best people to make it real. </p></p><p>After these two years, I've passed from Design/Development in my own company of one, to be the Senior Web Architect in a solid web development company, and my steady salary allowed me to rent a place and marry my love. </p></p><p>In this process, I've been analyzing the way our community has grown in size and world scope, and how we've appeared in different media news. Besides that, our admin group has grown strong personal relations, we've supported each other in our best and worst times, and shared some fascinating intercultural intercontinental facts, traditions and wisdom. </p></p><p>What I've learned from all this is that all the hopes I had put in this medium are true: the Internet can effectively communicate people (understanding communication as the ability to coordinate our behavior - thus achieve things together) we've formed an organization that defies both economical and hierarchical traditions of organizations, and we have succeeded in it. I definitively believe that the Internet is the tool that will help us reach a new era, where collaboration will play a key role in all our forms of organization. </p></p><p>Cheers to all the people who have given their grain (or truckfull) of sand, I feel very happy to live in this moment of history, and twice as happy to form part of this lovely human community of electrified kids. </p>
