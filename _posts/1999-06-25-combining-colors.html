I've always loved playing with colors. As a kid I played with finger-paint, wax </p>pencils, color pencils, felt-tip pens, and paint! Then color papers, brushes and </p>paint, watercolor, etc. Until I got my fist computer with a color screen, started </p>playing with pixelated colors, though I didn't know about RGB at the time, with </p>a program called Super Paint, which had an amazing feature that made the color </p>palette in your image rotate! And finally I've been playing with color photography. </p><p> So you can imagine my excitement when I saw that question from Dave on thelist, </p>  "how do you pick colors?" </p><p> By definition, the best two colors to combine are opposite (or complimentary) </p>  colors, which are opposed on the color wheel, the 1:1 mix of opposite colors </p>  results in mid-grey, neutral color by definition. This "perfect combination" </p>  can often be seen in interior decoration and it's always a good place to start, </p>  then you can change the hues and tones to give it a personal character and make </p>  it unique. </p><p> Then when you start adding colors to the palette, it depends only on your </p>  experience and judging capacity. This capacity to judge must be enriched daily </p>  as you simply live with your eyes wide open. Look all around you, we're surrounded </p>  by objects of design: clothes, boxes, CDs, books. On the streets: ads, cars, </p>  motorcycles (the most flashy colors here), stores, buildings. In nature: (best </p>  combinations around) trees, plants, flowers, insects, stones, mountains, branches, </p>  birds, etc. Of course, hundreds of master painters who have left years of work </p>  as evidence.</p><p> Below I have stuck some of the responses to Dave's question pulled from <a HREF="http://lists.evolt.org/">thelist</a>...</p><hr NOSHADE></p><p>Within the confines of that publication I found a link to the mother of all </p>  color tools, for me - the VisiBone 216-Color Webmaster's Palette, at their Webmaster's </p>  Color Laboratory, which you can dial up at: <a HREF="http://www.visibone.com/colorlab/">http://www.visibone.com/colorlab/</a> </p>  . Although designed principally for Photoshop, I use it frequently for color </p>  theme creations, in conjunction with "Color Harmony 2." The web safe colors </p>  are arranged in a circular design, by hue, 'somewhat' similar to a color wheel, </p>  and by selecting colors from corresponding positions on the 'color wheel,' you </p>  can put together themes in a snap that will utterly stupefy you. It displays </p>  colors in RGB, hex, AND CMYK. Try it! It's online, and FREE. </p><p> Tom Tetzlaff</p><hr NOSHADE></p><p>...For sites with a lot of information, stuff that's updated daily or needs </p>  to be read by a lot of people.. I always use a base of white for background. </p>  It's neat, clean and lends itself well to printing. After that, I might add </p>  a picture or grayscale imagery on top of that, but less is more. </p><p> Jen Delgrosso</p><hr NOSHADE></p><p>So don't try to think of something of your own :) Put away your web palettes, </p>  go take a walk outside... pick a flower, take a look at the colours on it and </p>  how they're combined. Look at trees, look at grocery store packaging (but not </p>  for too long, your eyes will hurt), look around. Surf with the yahoo URL randomizer. </p><p> Or for a wonderfully different approach that I use often since I found this </p>  page, check out Joe Gillespie's "web page design for designers" site: I'd start </p>  here http://www.wpdfd.com/wpdpal3.htm especially the last paragraph, on using </p>  a photograph with the feel you want to capture to create your palette (in short, </p>  take a photo, any photo, reduce the palette to the 3 or 4 strongest colours, </p>  and use those, in similar proportions to the amount of each colour in the photo). </p><p> It's a grand technique, and sometimes when I'm a little stuck, or just messing </p>  around, I take my favourite photo's, and do this to them, and save them in a </p>  text file as tags, ready to drop into a page on a moments notice. When I'm stuck </p>  for inspiration, I sit there with a temp file changing out body tags I've already </p>  prepared, until I find one that either works or sends my mind off on a tangent </p>  and comes up with something else. </p><p> I do believe nature knows best what colours go together, and she's been doing </p>  it a lot longer than we have. </p><p> Lauri W, Koping, Sweden </p><hr NOSHADE></p><p>I would only add that you really ought to give consideration to the print collateral </p>  of those companies that have worked to establish a visual identity. I, for one, </p>  hate visiting sites of companies or (especially) publications whose site incorporates </p>  nothing of what makes me like their stuff. </p><p> Also, I would suggest you also consider the psychology of the colors you choose. </p>  Now, some people don't put any stock at all in the theory, but I personally </p>  think there's something to it. Your choice of color can appeal to pleasure, </p>  dominance and arousal, which affects men, women and "culture" members differently. </p><p> Maria Teresa Molina</p><hr NOSHADE></p><p>Artistic inspiration for me is almost inherent. I grew up in an art gallery </p>  and have spent my entire life surrounded by great artists and I think that interaction </p>  has helped me greatly. Basically I think you just need to walk around with your </p>  eyes open and you'll draw your style and inspiration from the world around you. </p>  I think it helps that I take the time and walk to work everyday and honestly </p>  make a conscious effort to look at the horizon while I walk instead of the typical </p>  10 foot radius us humans tend to focus on. Try it, you'll be amazed at how much </p>  more you see. </p><p> Ryan </p><hr NOSHADE></p><p>I would suggest (in addition to the wonderful ideas already suggested) that </p>  everyone start a clip file. Basically, whenever I see something that sparks </p>  my imagination in a magazine or advertisement or postcard I cut it out and put </p>  it in my clipboard. I have quite a collection of clips which interested me either </p>  for their color scheme, their mood or their typography. Whenever I'm stuck in </p>  a rut I pull it out and and get new ideas. </p><p> Also, once a month or even more, take a special trip down to a big bookstore </p>  and thumb through all the magazines with visually interesting covers. Buy the </p>  ones that have lots of potential "clips" in them. Go to your town's most visually </p>  interesting street and wander around picking up not just sights but scents and </p>  sounds. Bring a notebook with you and write about it. Take photos so you'll </p>  remember how fantastic that red doorway looked in the morning sun. It's not </p>  just a good exercise for your brain it's therapy too! </p><p> - amanda </p><hr NOSHADE>
