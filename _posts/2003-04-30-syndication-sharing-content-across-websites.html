<p>The Internet is rapidly becoming a popular way to</p>disseminate content or to collect and redistribute it via other websites and</p>intranets. The term syndication was originally used in the world of print media to</p>refer to a news agency that sells news articles, comic strips or crossword puzzles</p>to many newspapers under the assumption that readers buy only one of them. On the</p>web, the idea of content syndication is basically similar - one party makes the</p>content of its website available in such a manner that many other parties can pick</p>it up via the Internet, automatically and as often as needed.</p></p><p><p>Not only news agencies use syndication to distribute their news. Record companies syndicate advertisements</p>promoting their latest album releases, which are picked up and used by music</p>retailers to add value to their websites. Similarly, international corporations</p>syndicate business information, and stock exchanges around the world publish share</p>prices in real time. Banks, investment brokers and institutional investors pick up</p>these newsfeeds to monitor developments in a particular industry sector or even in</p>specific companies and to watch trends in the stock markets.</p></p><p><p>Syndicated content is distributed via so-called <q>newsfeeds</q> that are received and displayed on other</p>websites, intranets or personal desktops. New applications are being developed to display syndicated content on devices other than websites and intranets, such as</p>personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones. In this issue we discuss how content syndication can benefit your organization. We explain the technology in</p>clear and non-technical language and suggest some issues that you may wish to address before you decide that your organization should also start using this Internet technology.</p></p><p><h2>How can content syndication benefit your organization?</h2></p><p>The decision as to whether your organization actually needs to adopt content</p>syndication, and how best to use this Internet technology, will depend on your</p>organization's mission, and the purpose and functions of your website. For example:</p></p></p><ol></p><p><li><strong>Content distribution:</strong> Your organization wishes to promote the information services</p>offered by your website. Applying syndication, you can offer a newsfeed via which</p>headlines and links to the content on your site can be picked up by any number of</p>organizations and displayed on their websites or intranets.</li></p><li><strong>Content gathering:</strong> Your organization wishes to monitor developments in a particular field of interest.</p>You can pick up other organizations' newsfeeds (one or more) and display the</p>headlines and links on your intranet. In this way, your staff will be able to access</p>- via your intranet - daily updated headline news from various selected websites.</p>This feature of content syndication could also add value to your website by</p>displaying the latest headline news and links of selected organizations on your</p>website. This could be useful, for example, if your organization is preparing a</p>conference, conducting an advocacy campaign, or monitoring a specific situation,</p>such as a regional conflict.</li></p><li><strong>Content brokering:</strong> Your organization functions as a</p>knowledge centre, and wishes both to distribute and to gather content related to one</p>or more topics. In this case, you could strengthen your organization's position by</p>distributing your own content as well as providing web pages where visitors can find</p>thematic headline information with links to the complete articles posted on a large</p>number of other sites.</li></p><li><strong>Content networking</strong>: Your organization is part of a</p>knowledge sharing network that wishes to exchange content among the members on a</p>regular basis. For this, each participating organization could install a newsfeed on</p>its website and pick up the headlines and links provided by the other network</p>members.</li></p></ol></p><p><p>These are still early days for content syndication, and new applications of this</p>novel means of exchanging and sharing information are actively being explored. For</p>example, content syndication can be used to compile automatically the content of</p>email newsletters, as well as to update discussion forums, conference agendas,</p>theatre programmes, or sales promotion campaigns for games, photos and software.</p></p></p><p><h2>What Exactly Is Content Syndication?</h2></p><p>Content syndication on the web refers to a technology that facilitates the distribution of content from one computer to any</p>number of other computers via the Internet. Content syndication does not entail the</p>distribution of the complete articles, images or files. Rather, it offers</p>information about the website where the content can be found, and headline</p>information with links to the web pages where the complete content can be accessed.</p>The basic element of content syndication is the syndication file, which is located</p>on the web server of the distributor of the content. This file contains information</p>about the site, the headlines and the links to web pages containing the content.</p></p><p><p>For example, the syndication file on the server of a newspaper could include:</p><ol type="i"> <li>the</p>title of the newspaper;</li></p><li>the headlines of articles published on its website; and</li></p><li>links to the full texts of these articles. An example of such a syndication</p>file can be viewed by opening the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/syndication/feeds/news/ukfs_news/world/rss091.xml" target="_blank" title="BBC&acute;s news syndication file">BBC's news syndication file</a> in your browser.</li></ol></p><p><p>Content syndication was first popularized by Netscape in 1999, for adding and updating news</p>from selected web sources to its personalized <cite><a href="http://my.netscape.com" target="_blank" title="My.Netscape">My.Netscape</a></cite> pages.</p>For this purpose, Netscape developed RSS ('Rich Site</p>Summary' or renamed by some: 'Really Simple Syndication'), a format for syndication files based on</p>XML, a computer language used for describing, storing and exchanging information.</p></p></p><p><p>With these RSS files, Netscape no longer required an army of editors to gather</p>content to fill its ever-growing portal. Instead, webmasters or content distributors</p>could create newsfeeds by placing RSS files on their servers and submitting</p>information about their exact location. All that Netscape then needed to do was to</p>collect these newsfeeds at regular intervals and display their contents on its</p>portal, thus offering its visitors a continuously updated set of headlines and links</p>to the latest information posted on many websites. </p></p></p><p>Netscape thus created a mutually</p>beneficial relationship between the visitors to its portal and the content</p>distributors. The visitors could view the latest news headlines published on a wide</p>range of websites from which they could make their own selection, and the content</p>distributors benefited from the increased numbers of visitors who followed the links</p>attached to the headlines to their websites.</p></p></p><h2>Syndication Servers</h2></p><p>News can be syndicated directly among websites or intranets, or it can be gathered by so-called</p>syndication servers, or content aggregators, that bring together many newsfeeds in a</p>central location. Examples include <a href="http://moreover.com" target="_blank" title="Moreover">Moreover</a>,</p><a href="http://www.syndic8.com" target="_blank" title="Syndic8">Syndic8</a> and <a href="http://newsisfree.com" target="_blank" title="News is Free">News is Free</a>.</p></p></p><p>These syndication</p>servers offer many facilities for selecting newsfeeds (e.g. BBC World News, SciDev</p>or Oneworld) and displaying their content in a variety of ways. For example,</p>syndicated content from selected newsfeeds can be included on an organization's</p>website simply by cutting and pasting a single line of code into the HTML code of</p>the webpage where this content is to be displayed. Once this code has been inserted,</p>any changes in the content (such as new articles added to or old ones deleted from</p>the BBC World News section or Oneworld site) are reflected in the headline</p>information and links displayed on your website.</p></p></p><h2>What Issues Need to be Addressed?</h2></p><p>From the point of view of the management of an organization, the main challenges</p>posed by content syndication are not technical. Content syndication is a low-tech</p>Internet technology that does not require new equipment or software. All your</p>technical team has to do is to create a newsfeed by placing an RSS file on your web</p>server, and keep it up to date. If your website has been set up on the basis of a</p>content management system, a function can be added to generate an RSS file and to update it automatically</p>whenever the content of your website is changed. Otherwise, changes to an RSS file</p>can be made manually using a simple word processor such as Notepad, or with so-</p>called 'scrapers', i.e. services available on the web to generate and automatically</p>update an RSS file (e.g. <a href="http://myrss.com/new.html" target="_blank" title="myRSS">myRSS</a>).</p></p><p></p><p>For any organization that decides to take advantage of content syndication, the major challenges are</p>related to the generation and regular maintenance of the content, as well as the</p>selection of newsfeeds to appear on your website or intranet. For example,</p></p><ol></p><li>If you</p>decide to syndicate your organization's web content, considerable effort will be</p>needed on an ongoing basis to ensure the quality of the information, in terms of</p>style, clarity and timeliness. For instance, if a visitor clicks on an eye-catching</p>headline, but this leads only to a dull, incomprehensible and/or out of date piece</p>of text on your site this will do nothing to enhance your organization's image and</p>credibility, and that visitor is unlikely to return.</li></p><li>Alternatively, if you decide</p>to include the newsfeeds of other organizations on your own website, then these must</p>be chosen with care. A poor selection of newsfeeds may result in a display of</p>headlines that may be inappropriate for your site - for example, the scope may be</p>too broad, they may be promoting own institutional or donors' interests, etc.</p></li></p></ol></p><p>In short, if you wish to engage your organization - as a content distributor, gatherer,</p>broker or net worker - in content syndication, you may need to review your</p>information and communication strategy to ensure that high priority is given to the</p>content management of your website or intranet.</p></p>
