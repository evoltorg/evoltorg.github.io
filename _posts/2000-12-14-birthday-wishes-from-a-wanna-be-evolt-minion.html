I don't mean to wax hyperbolic, but I think evolt represents the best of the web.  \nPeople help each other - for free - with quality information, \ninstruction, and opinion.  Thanks to the < tip > practice, thelist \nsignal-to-noise ratio is superb, and flames are practically \nnon-existent.  When the etoy/eToys domain name controversy broke last \nyear, evoltians banded together to make some noise and cause some \nchange.  Dedicated folks make sure the various lists and servers stay \nup and running.  The new evolt 2.0 exemplifies the commitment, \ninitiative, wisdom, and creative talent of this happy little web\ndevelopment community.  </p><p>Sometimes I feel as if I tag along after thelist like a \nkid sister, picking up perl tips or wap basics, asking for an \noccasional browser check, and in the old net tradition,\nI try to help those who tag along after me.  It's not often I can \nauthoritatively answer a question on thelist; I have not yet gathered\nthe courage to write an article, so I am keenly aware of the debt I owe\nto evolt.  I appreciate this community so much and don't say it enough, \nso my hat's off to you, dear Dan, Martin, Rudy, Scott, Isaac, Jeff,\nWolf, aardvark, Adrian, Anthony, Julia, Gina, Marlene, Matthew, and \neveryone else who ever helped a rookie evolter.  After a year of \nmembership, evolt remains the only list I would pay to join.  \nOf course, it's free, and that's the beauty of evolt...the best of the web.
