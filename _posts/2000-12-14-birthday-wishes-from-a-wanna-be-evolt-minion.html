I don't mean to wax hyperbolic, but I think evolt represents the best of the web.  </p>People help each other - for free - with quality information, </p>instruction, and opinion.  Thanks to the < tip > practice, thelist </p>signal-to-noise ratio is superb, and flames are practically </p>non-existent.  When the etoy/eToys domain name controversy broke last </p>year, evoltians banded together to make some noise and cause some </p>change.  Dedicated folks make sure the various lists and servers stay </p>up and running.  The new evolt 2.0 exemplifies the commitment, </p>initiative, wisdom, and creative talent of this happy little web</p>development community.  </p><p>Sometimes I feel as if I tag along after thelist like a </p>kid sister, picking up perl tips or wap basics, asking for an </p>occasional browser check, and in the old net tradition,</p>I try to help those who tag along after me.  It's not often I can </p>authoritatively answer a question on thelist; I have not yet gathered</p>the courage to write an article, so I am keenly aware of the debt I owe</p>to evolt.  I appreciate this community so much and don't say it enough, </p>so my hat's off to you, dear Dan, Martin, Rudy, Scott, Isaac, Jeff,</p>Wolf, aardvark, Adrian, Anthony, Julia, Gina, Marlene, Matthew, and </p>everyone else who ever helped a rookie evolter.  After a year of </p>membership, evolt remains the only list I would pay to join.  </p>Of course, it's free, and that's the beauty of evolt...the best of the web.
