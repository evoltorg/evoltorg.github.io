excerpt: "Macromedia released HomeSite 5 last Tuesday. Many of us are using HomeSite for one reason or another, but should we buy the new version? Let's take a look at a few of the things that are different in the latest version."

<p>I have had very few conversations with other web people about HomeSite. It </p>  almost seems invisible in the web community, yet I've found it installed on </p>  the computers of many, many web professionals. How does it get there? Did we </p>  buy it, download it, pirate it, crack it, did it ride in alongside Dreamweaver </p>  or some other power app? However it arrived, it's here and many of us are using </p>  it.</p></p><p>But will we buy new version? Decide for yourself.</p></p><p>HomeSite 5 was officially released on October 23rd under the Macromedia brand </p>  name, without a lot of fanfare. It comes with some notable changes, of which </p>  I'm going to highlight just a few.</p></p><p><h2>Selected Changes</h2></p><p><ul></p>  <li>Integrated XHTML Support</li></p>  <li>The &quot;Secondary Files tab&quot;</li></p>  <li>Automatic Backup</li></p>  <li>No more stinkin' &quot;Design View&quot;</li></p>  <li>&quot;Folder Deployment&quot;</li></p></ul></p><p><h3>Integrated XHTML Support</h3></p><p>This sounds great, but I wasn't sold in practice. It allows me to create a </p>  &quot;New XHTML Document&quot; whose <code>DOCTYPE</code> is set to the correct </p>  XHTML DTD, but doesn't automatically validate my code as I type. Pressing SHIFT+F6 </p>  to validate my code with the validator I selected in my Settings however, still </p>  works just fine.</p></p><h3>The &quot;Secondary Files tab&quot;</h3></p><p>This is HomeSite's name for a second file explorer tab that you can use to </p>  access files across multiple directories, drives, or FTP &amp; RDS hosts, at </p>  the same time. This is great for those of us who work on many things at once </p>  or who just don't keep everything organized in one location. It shouldn't be </p>  a revolutionary idea, but it's one that I haven't seen in many programs. Maybe </p>  in future versions they'll allow us to open as many Secondary Files tabs as </p>  we'd like.</p></p><h3>Automatic Backup</h3></p><p>Even though (CTRL+S) I compulsively (CTRL+S) save my work (CTRL+S) I appreciate </p>  (CTRL+S) any program (CTRL+S) that backs (CTRL+S) it up for me (CTRL+S) automatically. </p>  HomeSite </p>  5 backs up any file that HomeSite has edited in it's program folder by default, </p>  but you can turn it off or customize it in the Settings any time. HomeSite </p>  will assist you in recovering your files later, if need be. And that's all it </p>  will do. If you want your whole web site to be periodically downloaded and backed </p>  up on a different computer (which is also a good idea) then you need to try </p>  a different program or talk to your web host.</p></p><h3>No More Stinkin' &quot;Design View&quot;</h3></p><p>Well, I'm really sorry if you were one of the five people who were actually using</p>HomeSite's &quot;Design View&quot;, but it's gone now. I always regarded this </p>&quot;feature&quot; as a real nuisance, something that I would mistakenly click </p>when trying to preview a page. I would then be confronted with an error message that </p>warns me my HTML will be rewritten [badly]. Then I would have to click the </p>&quot;Of Course Not&quot; button and it was all a big waste of time. In short, I'm glad </p>it's gone.</p></p><p>However, the fact that no one mentioned the feature drop caused me to have</p>concern for the aforementioned five poor souls who were actually using the feature, so </p>I looked into why they dropped it. It turns out that it relied on a Microsoft based</p>control for which support was dropped. Did they tell anyone? It was documented in the</p>release notes, apparently. As if anyone reads those!</p></p><h3>Folder Deployment</h3></p><p>Macromedia is pitching this as a feature that is best for beginners, but I say it's a</p>great feature for anyone who is too busy or lazy (or both) to take the time to upload</p>many individual files. It allows you to upload an entire folder onto the web without </p>leaving HomeSite, something that was awkward to do in previous versions. </p></p><p><h2>A More Stable Program?</h2></p><p>If you are thinking of upgrading for the sole reason of getting rid of HomeSite's </p>  cryptic error messages, don't bother. It looks like they're here to stay in </p>  HomeSite 5. However, in the month that I've been using HomeSite 5 for my HTML </p>  and PHP development, it hasn't yet crashed once, which is a certainly fewer </p>  times than version 4.5 would have.</p></p><p><h2>Will You Upgrade?</h2></p><p>HomeSite really is a good program for being as powerful as you want it to be. </p>  I've never found it lacking in anything that I've wanted it for, be it syntax </p>  highlighting, spell checking, finding and replacing, or image map creating. </p>  It can't, however, be as little as you want it to be. If you were happiest using </p>  Notepad or Vi over a terminal with absolutely no frills then you don't need </p>  the extra confusion of all the other features that HomeSite has to offer.</p></p><p>In the end, a person needs to decide what kind of HomeSite user they are to </p>  figure out whether an upgrade is worth their time and money. If you're only </p>  using HomeSite because Notepad doesn't support CTRL-S for saving files, then </p>  don't bother. However, if you're like me and you like to use the myriad of features </p>  that HomeSite offers including Site Management and FTP support, then new features </p>  might be just what you need to save a little bit of time on your web projects.</p></p><p></p><table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"></p>  <tr><th colspan="2">the Details</th></tr></p>  <tr></p>    <th>Price</th></p>    <th>Links</th></p>  </tr></p>  <tr valign="top"> </p>    <td>Full Version: $99 USD<br></p>      Upgrade Version: $29</td></p>    <td> </p>      <p><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/homesite/" target="_blank">Macromedia HomeSite </p>        Web Site</a><br></p>        <a href="http://builder.cnet.com/webbuilding/0-7255-8-7614400-2.html?tag=st.bl.7255-8-7614400-1.txt.7255-8-7614400-2" target="_blank">CNET </p>        Review of HomeSite 5<br></p>        </a><a href="http://forums.allaire.com/visual/messageview.cfm?catid=92&threadid=227345" target="_blank">Allaire </p>        Support on the Missing Design View</a></p></p>      </td></p>  </tr></p></table>
