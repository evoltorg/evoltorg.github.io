To Vote for me, you must join.</p>\n<p>More details and the headlemur's secret campaign site is \n<a target="_blank" href="http://www.lemurzone.com/campaign/">here</a>.</p>\n<p>My site contains bio and other information about me. \nIt also contains a few Position Papers I am taking on certain Issues.</p>\n<p>Support, commentary, flames. I have broad shoulders, am a bit crazy \nand will serve if elected.</p>\n<p>Below are links to ICANN and information on how to get involved.</p>\n<p>Remember, It's everyone's web.</p>\n<p>Nomination by the Nominating Committee will thus be one \nof two avenues for candidates to appear on the final ballot. </p>\n<p>For more on the Nominating Committee, its members, and the At \nLarge election process, see \n<a target="_blank" href="http://www.icann.org/nomcom/">the Committee's \nhomepage</a>.
