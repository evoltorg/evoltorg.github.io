<p>The UK's Royal National Institute for the Blind have <a href="http://rnib.org.uk/access/welcome.htm" target="_blank" title="Opens New Window">this</a> article on producing designs for visually impaired people.</p>\n<p>It's interesting on 2 counts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's written by an actual disability organisation (rather than a 3rd party)\n<li>It has information on how HTML readers for visually impaired people (I guess this means braille and/or speech) render (or rather don't) render frames and image maps.\n</ol>
