<p>It had been such a long time since I had updated </p>my resume on Monster, Hotjobs, and a few other </p>job boards and as I was updating my 'hard copy' </p>of my resume, I thought I'd update those as </p>well.  I finished updating them all around 2:30pm </p>on Wednesday afternoon.</p></p><p><p>Within a half hour several emails popped into </p>my mailbox.  I had two phone calls already for me </p>when I got home and another one while I was </p>having dinner.  The next morning 10 new emails </p>were in my email box.  Most were from headhunters </p>that 'heard that I was really good at what I </p>do'.  I got home on Thursday and found 11 voice </p>messages waiting for me.</p></p><p><p>So then, the craziness starts.  Not one of the </p>people who called me was actually hiring for their </p>own company.  They were all recruiters looking to </p>help someone like me land the next hot job.  When </p>I told them that I wasn't seriously looking at </p>this time, many were trying to urge me towards </p>leaving my job now.  One was even so rude as to </p>ask why and when I said 'personal reasons' they </p>pressed me for a more informative answer.</p></p><p><p>Then I had the task of replying to all of the </p>emails I received.  I assumed that I could be </p>really bold with them and see what type of </p>response I'd get.  Assuming that most were not </p>interested in talking to me so soon, I wrote them </p>all the same polite email that explained:</p><ul></p><li>That I wouldn't accept a job unless it was in </p>one of several geographic locations.</p><li>That I wasn't look for any positions with </p>consulting firms</p><li>My salary requirements</p><li>The time period during which I expected to be </p>changing jobs.</p></ul></p><p><p>Needless to say, that did the trick.  I didn't </p>hear back from most of them.  But several did, </p>and so I learned an important lesson.  Here's </p>part of an email that I received:</p><blockquote><em></p>I suggest you take you resume off Monster so that </p>no one starts sending it out already and </p>potentially messing things up for you.  So people </p>just send it out, but then won't be able to </p>deliver you for an interview, but you now are </p>known at that company, so that if in 3-4 months </p>you are presented again (this time when you are </p>ready) you do not get </p>considered.</em></blockquote></p><p><p>I quickly blocked the visibility of my resumes </p>as he told me.  Now the calls and emails have </p>slowed down considerably.</p></p><p><p>I had such a poor response last year when I </p>was searching for a job out of school that I made </p>the wrong assumption that the same would occur </p>again.  How wrong I was?  While it's encouraging </p>to know that there are that many jobs out there, </p>this has been quite overwhelming.  I've </p>definitely learned from this and now I know the </p>routine for when I decide to look for a new job </p>again.</p></p><p><p>Happy to be your guinea pig,<br></p>JP Hackworth<br></p><a href="mailto:hackworth@newstrolls.com">hackworth@newstrolls.com<br></p><a href="http://www.newstrolls.com" target="_new">NewsTrolls, Inc.</a></p>
