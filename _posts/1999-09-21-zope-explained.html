<p><I>Note: this was originally written by <a href="mailto:dparker@gb.frontiernet.net">Dave Parker</a> on the <a href="http://www.newlug.org">Northeast Wisconsin Linux User Group</a> mailing list. I've posted it with permission from him. - .djc. </I></p><br><br></p>I want to explain better what Zope is - it really is a *very* different</p>way of thinking about web programming and web publishing.  The trick</p>with zope is understanding just what it's all about in the first place. </p>I think it's going to still come off kind of abstract, but I'll try to</p>give some concrete examples and drive it down to the real world</p>eventually.</p><br><br></p>My first thought was "oh, a web based publishing environment with</p>database ties - interesting".  But that's really giving it a seriously</p>short shrift.</p><br><br></p>Zope is much more like a <a href="http://directory.netscape.com/Computers/Programming/Languages/Smalltalk/">Smalltalk</a></p>(pure OO) environment that is tightly</p>bound (inextricably wedded) to the web (http), complete with all the OOP</p>essentials: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  All of the</p>native objects live in a multi-threaded, multi-user object database. </p>The object database is *not* a relational database backend - it's a real</p>object database with oids and optimistic locking and all that.  Zope</p>also has facilities called "database adapters" which allow you to</p>exploit an elegant (nearly transparent) object to relational mapping</p>mechanism.</p><br><br></p>Within all that is an authentication/authorization system.  Users have</p>roles.  All non-user objects in the system have permissions, which map</p>to roles (which are infinitely definable).  Permission to role mappings</p>can selectively be inherited from parent objects or defined at the level</p>of any given object regardless of parent mappings.  So the granularity</p>of authorization is extremely fine (if you want it to be).</p><br><br></p>The authentication system by default relies on user objects that are</p>defined in the object database.  But since the authentication system is</p>a component like anything else, it's possible to install alternative</p>systems that authenticate off of other sources, like relational</p>databases or flatfiles or LDAP servers or IMAP servers.  Depending on</p>the capabilities of the authentication backend, you can actually have as</p>much flexibility with them as you can with the native system (roles</p>etc).  LDAP would allow this for example.</p><br><br></p>The eventual goal of all that is to let you create dynamic (and static)</p>web content.</p><br><br></p>"Publishing" in the zope environment is 100% web based - you will</p>**NEVER** be at a command prompt - all interaction with Zope occurs</p>through http or ftp (primarily http).</p><br><br></p>The most basic type of publishing is the familiar "create content with</p>your local HTML WYSIWYG editor and publish with http PUT or ftp" thing. </p>From the perspective of http PUT and ftp, Zope's object environment</p>appears to be a filesystem of the ordinary sort, and your content shows</p>up as expected.</p><br><br></p>When you publish to zope in this way, you take advantage of the two most</p>basic types of "products" (roughly "classes", but they're more involved</p>than that): "Folders" and "DTML Documents".  These will be generated for</p>you automatically.</p><br><br></p>If you choose to work directly with Zope via it's web interface, you'll</p>work more directly with "products" and you'll have a much wider variety</p>of them at your disposal (plus you can create new ones, package them up,</p>and distribute them).</p><br><br></p>The key to dynamic publishing in Zope is it's "DTML" language.  DTML is</p>a superset of html that ties tightly with the object database and the</p>O-R mapping mechanism.  The genius of it lies in it's layering of</p>namespaces as relates to your current context - and the fact that all of</p>*that* maps to http (read: URLS) automatically.</p><br><br></p><a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> is just a scripting language - really leagues away from what Zope is</p>(PHP is closer to Perl w/extensions than it is to Zope).</p><br><br></p>To really figure it out, you have to work with it.  If people are really</p>interested we can do a demo (I'd be glad to do it).  Otherwise, get an</p>account at http://www.zope.org or set one up yourself and play with it. </p>The more you use it, the more you find.</p></p><p>
