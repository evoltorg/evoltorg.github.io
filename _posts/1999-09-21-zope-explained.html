<p><I>Note: this was originally written by <a href="mailto:dparker@gb.frontiernet.net">Dave Parker</a> on the <a href="http://www.newlug.org">Northeast Wisconsin Linux User Group</a> mailing list. I've posted it with permission from him. - .djc. </I>\n<br><br>\nI want to explain better what Zope is - it really is a *very* different\nway of thinking about web programming and web publishing.  The trick\nwith zope is understanding just what it's all about in the first place. \nI think it's going to still come off kind of abstract, but I'll try to\ngive some concrete examples and drive it down to the real world\neventually.\n<br><br>\nMy first thought was "oh, a web based publishing environment with\ndatabase ties - interesting".  But that's really giving it a seriously\nshort shrift.\n<br><br>\nZope is much more like a <a href="http://directory.netscape.com/Computers/Programming/Languages/Smalltalk/">Smalltalk</a>\n(pure OO) environment that is tightly\nbound (inextricably wedded) to the web (http), complete with all the OOP\nessentials: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  All of the\nnative objects live in a multi-threaded, multi-user object database. \nThe object database is *not* a relational database backend - it's a real\nobject database with oids and optimistic locking and all that.  Zope\nalso has facilities called "database adapters" which allow you to\nexploit an elegant (nearly transparent) object to relational mapping\nmechanism.\n<br><br>\nWithin all that is an authentication/authorization system.  Users have\nroles.  All non-user objects in the system have permissions, which map\nto roles (which are infinitely definable).  Permission to role mappings\ncan selectively be inherited from parent objects or defined at the level\nof any given object regardless of parent mappings.  So the granularity\nof authorization is extremely fine (if you want it to be).\n<br><br>\nThe authentication system by default relies on user objects that are\ndefined in the object database.  But since the authentication system is\na component like anything else, it's possible to install alternative\nsystems that authenticate off of other sources, like relational\ndatabases or flatfiles or LDAP servers or IMAP servers.  Depending on\nthe capabilities of the authentication backend, you can actually have as\nmuch flexibility with them as you can with the native system (roles\netc).  LDAP would allow this for example.\n<br><br>\nThe eventual goal of all that is to let you create dynamic (and static)\nweb content.\n<br><br>\n"Publishing" in the zope environment is 100% web based - you will\n**NEVER** be at a command prompt - all interaction with Zope occurs\nthrough http or ftp (primarily http).\n<br><br>\nThe most basic type of publishing is the familiar "create content with\nyour local HTML WYSIWYG editor and publish with http PUT or ftp" thing. \nFrom the perspective of http PUT and ftp, Zope's object environment\nappears to be a filesystem of the ordinary sort, and your content shows\nup as expected.\n<br><br>\nWhen you publish to zope in this way, you take advantage of the two most\nbasic types of "products" (roughly "classes", but they're more involved\nthan that): "Folders" and "DTML Documents".  These will be generated for\nyou automatically.\n<br><br>\nIf you choose to work directly with Zope via it's web interface, you'll\nwork more directly with "products" and you'll have a much wider variety\nof them at your disposal (plus you can create new ones, package them up,\nand distribute them).\n<br><br>\nThe key to dynamic publishing in Zope is it's "DTML" language.  DTML is\na superset of html that ties tightly with the object database and the\nO-R mapping mechanism.  The genius of it lies in it's layering of\nnamespaces as relates to your current context - and the fact that all of\n*that* maps to http (read: URLS) automatically.\n<br><br>\n<a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> is just a scripting language - really leagues away from what Zope is\n(PHP is closer to Perl w/extensions than it is to Zope).\n<br><br>\nTo really figure it out, you have to work with it.  If people are really\ninterested we can do a demo (I'd be glad to do it).  Otherwise, get an\naccount at http://www.zope.org or set one up yourself and play with it. \nThe more you use it, the more you find.</p>\n<p>
