He goes on to explain how companies have to re-consider their practices in order to keep the brain power on board - since there's nothing to keep employees from going off and creating wealth for themselves (barriers to entry being the information, dedication and smarts which they posses already).</p></p></p><p></p>It's a thought provoking article.</p></p></p><p></p><a href="mailto:bobd@members.evolt.org">bob</a></p></p></p>
