We apologize to those whose information was held a month longer.</p></p></p><p><p></p>Now, we know the summer months in the northern hemisphere are slow, but there's a whole other hemisphere's-worth of members who have thriving businesses, so don't be shy about toot-tooting your own horn-horn.  Surf on over to our <a href="http://evolt.org/contact/index.html">contact form</a> and let us all know what a swanky developer you are.</p></p></p><p><h2>Evoltspottings</h2></p><p>All over the web, people are looking to see what evolters have to say, and </p>  sometimes they point their users back to the source.
