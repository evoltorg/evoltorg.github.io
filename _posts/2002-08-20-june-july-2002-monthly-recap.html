<p>\nWe didn't hear much from our membership for June, so we decided to hold onto the June community news report and pair it up with July.  We apologize to those whose information was held a month longer.\n</p></p><p><p>\nNow, we know the summer months in the northern hemisphere are slow, but there's a whole other hemisphere's-worth of members who have thriving businesses, so don't be shy about toot-tooting your own horn-horn.  Surf on over to our <a href="http://evolt.org/contact/index.html">contact form</a> and let us all know what a swanky developer you are.\n</p></p><p><h2>Evoltspottings</h2>\n<p>All over the web, people are looking to see what evolters have to say, and \n  sometimes they point their users back to the source. Here are some of the pointers, \n  all noticed this month:</p></p><p><ul>\n  <li><a href="http://www.deftone.com/blogzilla" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window.">Blogzilla</a>, a blog about Mozilla <a href="http://www.deftone.com/blogzilla/archives/doctype_sniffing_in_mozilla.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window.">pointed to</a> William Mason&#8217;s news article about <a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/New_DOCTYPE_sniffing_in_upcoming_Mozilla_releases/1/32271/index.html">new doctype sniffing in Mozilla</a>, as did <a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=2345" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window.">Mozillazine</a>.</li>\n</ul></p><p><p>Thanks to the many people who have taken the time to cite evolt.org in their \n  own work</p></p><p>\n<h2>Help support evolt.org</h2></p><p><p>Our address for monetary gifts or giving inquiries is <a href="mailto:give%40evolt.org">give&#064;evolt.org</a>.</p>\n<p>We're looking for other on-line, commercial (in other words, <strong>not personal</strong> \n  bank account), low-cost money transferring capabilities so that non-US residents \n  may more easily help support evolt.org. <a href="mailto:give%40evolt.org">Please \n  write us</a> if you know of any good commercial services in your country. </p>\n<p>Here's more information on <a href="http://evolt.org/help_support_evolt/">how \n  to help support evolt.org</a>.

His main duties are web programming, system administration, and helping the company become more involved in the Open Source Community.\n<p>\nNow that he's down south again he should be able to make it to a few more London beervolts. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/fastshow/characters/patrick_nice.shtml">Which is nice</a>.\n</p></p><p><h3>Jeff Howden</h3></p><p><p>\nJeff has recently completed technical editing of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735713049/evoltorg02-20/" target="_new" title="Kickback link to Amazon.com; opens in new window">a newly released ColdFusion MX book, Inside ColdFusion MX</a>,\nwritten by John Cummings, Neil Ross, &amp; Robi Sen and published by New Rider's\nPublishing company.\n</p></p><p><p>\nIn addition to technical editing, he was also asked to submit some tips for\npublishing in one of the chapters. He even managed to get a tip from Rudy\npublished as well, athough Rudy made him obfuscate his email address.\n</p></p><p><p>\nAs if that wasn't enough, he was also selected by <a href="http://www.brainbench.com/" target="_new" title="Opens in new window">Brainbench</a> to clean\nan upcoming test for JavaScript 1.5 certification.  He was offered the\nopportunity because out of nearly 200 beta testers, he had the highest\nscore. And he's sexy, just like the rest of our members.\n</p></p><p><h2>Submissions</h2>\n<p>The evolt.org Monthly Recap is a summary of awards, meetings, and fresh opportunities \n  relevant to all of us.
