<!--break--></p><h2>WCAG 2.0 and Peace</h2></p><!--break--></p><p>The new WCAG 2.0 standard sparked a hot</p>discussion around web accessibility and the standard direction. The main issue</p>is how to make WCAG 2.0 simpler and easier to understand for web developer community.</p>WCAG working group received many suggestions to improve the standard: wording</p>changes for better clarity, changes to success criteria priority, new common</p>failures and techniques. Does it make the standard better? Maybe… Does it make</p>it simpler? Not really… </p></p><p></p><p><p>The main problem of WCAG 2.0 is its size. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques</a></p>documents are so big, that my IE7 works slow on them. FireFox performs better,</p>but even it died once without any notice during my WCAG 2.0 documents browsing.</p>By its size WCAG 2.0 is very close to <a href="http://www.friends-partners.org/oldfriends/literature/war_and_peace/war-peace_intro.html">War and Peace</a> of Leo Tolstoy. This titanic book is a part of the official high school</p>curriculum in Russia. However only a few scholars really read it. They prefer abridged</p>versions, which take around 5% of the original folio. </p></p><p></p><p><p>Talking seriously, WCAG 2.0 is too broad to</p>convey easy to understand ideas about web accessibility. In attempt to combat</p>complexity and size, many web developers suggested a compact version of WCAG</p>2.0, which is easier to understand and to follow. This approach is definitely valid,</p>however how to choose the correct rules from the broad set?</p></p><p></p><p><p>We are looking on the WCAG 2.0 process from</p>the side of the software developer, who has experience with internet browsers and</p>web accessibility. The most strange thing to us in the WCAG 2.0 that the</p>working group relies only on web developers to make their pages accessible.</p>There is no discussion regarding user agents (screen readers and internet</p>browsers). The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/Overview.html" title="User Agent Accessibility Guidelines">UAAG</a> web site claims an intention to link content accessibility with accessibility requirements to user agents. However WCAG 2.0 was designed without clear definition of the user</p>agents where it can be applied. The result of this approach is a huge set of rules,</p>which are hardly understandable for many web developers. </p></p><p></p><p><h2>Roadmap to simpler web accessibility</h2></p><!--break--></p><p></p><p>There are only a few assistive tools, millions</p>people, who create web pages, and billions of web pages. Consider the</p>following: </p></p><p><ul></p> <li>Some assistive tools are not good enough.</p>     </li></p> <li>It is much simpler and quicker to improve</p>     several assistive tools than to teach accessibility to millions of web</p>     developers.</li></p> <li>From the billions of existing web pages,</p>     only a tiny share will be modified to conform WCAG 2.0. Therefore, there</p>     is a need for good assistive tools to view legacy content, which will</p>     never be modified.</li></p> <li>The technology, not the bureaucracy, makes</p>     life easier.</li></p></ul></p><p></p><p><p>Summarizing the points above, we make a</p>conclusion that defining content accessibility should start from examining user</p>agents and recommending the software, which really works well and can be</p>improved further. It is hardly possible to design accessibility guidelines for <em>any</em></p>user agent. Limited scope of user agents is a good platform for easy to</p>understand and feasible accessibility guidelines. </p></p><p></p><p><p>WAI should specify the UAAG requirements,</p>which match the needs of WCAG 2.0. These guidelines should set technology</p>targets to assistive tools vendors. As soon as a technology target is met by</p>the most of recommended user agents, the corresponding WCAG 2.0 requirement</p>should retire or go to good practices status (level 3).</p></p><p></p><p><p>Our team investigated the WCAG 2.0 draft </p>(level 1 and 2) in order to find success criteria, techniques and failures,</p>which can be resolved by assistive tools. We detected several candidate SCs to be</p>removed or simplified. </p></p><p></p><p><h2>WCAG 2.0 user agent dependant success criteria </h2></p><!--break--></p><p></p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#content-structure-separation-emphasis" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 1.3.4">SC 1.3.4</a></p>Information that is conveyed by variations in presentation of text is also</p>conveyed in text, or the variations in presentation of text can be</p>programmatically determined. (Level 2)</strong></p></h3></p><p></p><p>In the other words, if important</p>information is conveyed in text by using bold, italic or other HTML markup, it</p>must be understandable without markup. WCAG 2.0 proposes two solutions: explain</p>the information using additional text or allow programmatic access to it. </p></p><p></p><p><p>This success criteria is mixing requirement</p>to a web content (<q>presentation … conveyed in text</q>) with a requirement to a</p>user agent (<q>presentation … can be programmatically determined</q>). In fact, text</p>font, size, typeface is always can be extracted from a browser. If a browser</p>writes text in bold it knows about it. The assistive tool can get information</p>about text typeface through browser's API. A web developer can not do anything</p>to prevent an assistive tool from obtaining this information.</p></p><p></p><p><p>Using this knowledge we can conclude that</p>the related common failure <q><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/Overview.html#F2">F2: Failure of SC 1.3.1 and 1.3.4 due to using CSS</p>to create variations in presentation of text that conveys information without</p>also using the appropriate markup or text.</a></q> is not valid. It assures, that a web developer can confuse a user by using not</p>appropriate CSS. However a browser shows the <q>NO</q> word in bold and an assistive</p>tool (Jaws, for example) can inform a user about bold text regardless the CSS</p>class definition. </p></p><p></p><p><h4>Conclusion.</h4></p><p><p>The modern versions of assistive tools can</p>inform a user about markup. Therefore the second part of the SC 1.3.4 is met. WCAG</p>WG should consider excluding this success criteria out of the standard body.</p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#visual-audio-contrast-contrast" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria SC 1.4.1">SC 1.4.1</a> Text or diagrams, and their background, have a luminosity contrast ratio of at least 5:1. (Level 2)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>The text contrast problem can be 100%</p>resolved by browsers. Both Internet Explorer and FireFox have settings, which define</p>text and background colors on a web page. Furthermore, it is possible to</p>improve the contrast automatically on page, calculation the contrast and</p>brightness using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/appendixA.html#luminosity-contrastdef">W3C formula</a>.</p>Do we really need this requirement for text in HTML on the level 2, if it can</p>be fixed by user agents automatically? </p></p><p></p><p><p>The related <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/Overview.html#F24">common failure F24</a></p>provides examples of code, which does not allow certain (not specified) user</p>agents to enable user defined font and background colors. If a browser does not</p>allow to change text and background colors, it is a clear user agent problem. Our</p>team tested all these examples using Internet Explorer 6 and 7 beta 3, FireFox</p>1.5, Opera. In fact, only IE 6 has problems with the examples 1 and 2. The</p>other browsers, including the IE 7, show text with the user defined color and</p>on the user defined background correctly. Therefore the bug in IE 6 is fixed in</p>the IE 7.0. Read the full <a href="http://www.erigami.com/blog/wcag-color-user-defined/">test report</a>.</p></p></p><p></p><p><p>The real contrast problem is with images</p>and applets. There is no automatic way to improve the contrast in this case.</p>However this situation is covered by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/guidelines.html#text-equiv">WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.1</a>.</p></p></p><p></p><p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p><p><p>The color contrast problem can be resolved</p>by user agents. This is not a real barrier. Therefore this SC should take place</p>in the good practices of web accessibility.</p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#visual-audio-contrast-dis-audio" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria SC 1.4.2">SC 1.4.2</a> A mechanism is available to turn off background audio that plays automatically, without requiring the user to turn off all audio. (Level 2)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>Playing sound interferes with the reader</p>voice, which cause problems to disabled users. Internet Explorer has a setting</p>to disable audio on a web page (Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced tab</p>&gt; Multimedia &gt; Play sounds in web pages). It looks like the problem is</p>easy to solve. Unfortunately, it is not. The IE setting rules only HTML background</p>sound. It can not disable sound from the ActiveX objects, like Flash. FireFox</p>do not have a sound setting ever. In fact, many users dislike the sound from</p>Flash, but currently they have the only option to mute the sound in operation</p>system. This is not acceptable for screen readers.</p></p><p></p><p><p>The problem is in the Windows operation</p>system. However it can be resolved. To prove the concept, we conducted a</p>research and discovered a simple <a href="http://www.erigami.com/blog/disable-sound-firefox-ie/">method to disable Flash and other browser</p>sounds</a> in FireFox and</p>Internet Explorer. The other Windows sounds keep playing (including Jaws!). </p></p><p></p><p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p><p><p>The problem should be forwarded to</p>Microsoft. They should provide a simple way to block all sounds originated from</p>a browser and keep readers working.</p></p><p></p><p><h2>Other WCAG 2.0 success criteria where user agents can help</h2></p><!--break--></p><p></p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#time-limits-blink" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 2.2.2">SC 2.2.2</a></p>Content does not blink for more than three seconds, or a method is available to</p>stop all blinking content in the Web unit or authored component. (Level 2)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>Browsers enable text blinking on the</p>corresponding HTML tags. Therefore they can disable it. Stop button in IE7</p>blocks animated GIFs, for example. The specific problem is blinking from Flash</p>objects. Microsoft and Adobe should provide an API to stop animations.</p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#consistent-behavior-receive-focus" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 3.2.1">SC 3.2.1</a></p>When any component receives focus, it does not cause a change of context.</p>(Level 1)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>This SC can be resolved by user agents.</p>Popup blockers are very standard today. The other unexpected actions as</p>navigating a browser to a new page on selecting a choice in pull down menu or</p>changing focus on click, can be suspended as well. A user agent can ask a user</p>whether to perform a blocked action.  It seems this requirement is a good</p>candidate for retirement.</p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#consistent-behavior-unpredictable-change" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 3.2.2">SC 3.2.2</a> Changing the setting of any form control or field does not automatically cause</p>a change of context (beyond moving to the next field in tab order), unless the</p>authored unit contains instructions before the control that describe the</p>behavior. (Level 1)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>This SC is very close to 3.2.1 and can be</p>resolved in a similar manner. </p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#meaning-doc-lang-id" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 3.1.1">SC 3.1.1</a></p>The primary natural language or languages of the Web unit can be</p>programmatically determined. (Level 1)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>This SC puts a lot of attention to</p>right-to-left language information. In fact, this kind of data is</p>programmatically determined by browsers, since they need to render</p>right-to-left text correctly. The RTL language is programmatically determinable</p>by itself, because all they contain unique symbols. So it is quite easy to</p>distinguish between Hebrew and Arabic. In contrast, Polish and Czech are not</p>easy to detect automatically, since they share the same character set. If</p>disabled users find it useful, browsers can inform them about RTL content</p>presence on a web page.</p></p><p></p><p><h2>Summary of suggestions to WCAG 2.0</h2></p><!--break--></p><p></p><ol></p> <li>Define and officially publish the set of</p>     user agents for WCAG 2.0. </li></p> <li>Define UAAG requirements, which conform</p>     with the WCAG 2.0.
