<!--break-->\n<h2>WCAG 2.0 and Peace</h2>\n<!--break-->\n<p>The new WCAG 2.0 standard sparked a hot\ndiscussion around web accessibility and the standard direction. The main issue\nis how to make WCAG 2.0 simpler and easier to understand for web developer community.\nWCAG working group received many suggestions to improve the standard: wording\nchanges for better clarity, changes to success criteria priority, new common\nfailures and techniques. Does it make the standard better? Maybe… Does it make\nit simpler? Not really… </p></p><p></p><p><p>The main problem of WCAG 2.0 is its size. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques</a>\ndocuments are so big, that my IE7 works slow on them. FireFox performs better,\nbut even it died once without any notice during my WCAG 2.0 documents browsing.\nBy its size WCAG 2.0 is very close to <a href="http://www.friends-partners.org/oldfriends/literature/war_and_peace/war-peace_intro.html">War and Peace</a> of Leo Tolstoy. This titanic book is a part of the official high school\ncurriculum in Russia. However only a few scholars really read it. They prefer abridged\nversions, which take around 5% of the original folio. </p></p><p></p><p><p>Talking seriously, WCAG 2.0 is too broad to\nconvey easy to understand ideas about web accessibility. In attempt to combat\ncomplexity and size, many web developers suggested a compact version of WCAG\n2.0, which is easier to understand and to follow. This approach is definitely valid,\nhowever how to choose the correct rules from the broad set?</p></p><p></p><p><p>We are looking on the WCAG 2.0 process from\nthe side of the software developer, who has experience with internet browsers and\nweb accessibility. The most strange thing to us in the WCAG 2.0 that the\nworking group relies only on web developers to make their pages accessible.\nThere is no discussion regarding user agents (screen readers and internet\nbrowsers). The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/Overview.html" title="User Agent Accessibility Guidelines">UAAG</a> web site claims an intention to link content accessibility with accessibility requirements to user agents. However WCAG 2.0 was designed without clear definition of the user\nagents where it can be applied. The result of this approach is a huge set of rules,\nwhich are hardly understandable for many web developers. </p></p><p></p><p><h2>Roadmap to simpler web accessibility</h2>\n<!--break--></p><p>\n<p>There are only a few assistive tools, millions\npeople, who create web pages, and billions of web pages. Consider the\nfollowing: </p></p><p><ul>\n <li>Some assistive tools are not good enough.\n     </li>\n <li>It is much simpler and quicker to improve\n     several assistive tools than to teach accessibility to millions of web\n     developers.</li>\n <li>From the billions of existing web pages,\n     only a tiny share will be modified to conform WCAG 2.0. Therefore, there\n     is a need for good assistive tools to view legacy content, which will\n     never be modified.</li>\n <li>The technology, not the bureaucracy, makes\n     life easier.</li>\n</ul></p><p></p><p><p>Summarizing the points above, we make a\nconclusion that defining content accessibility should start from examining user\nagents and recommending the software, which really works well and can be\nimproved further. It is hardly possible to design accessibility guidelines for <em>any</em>\nuser agent. Limited scope of user agents is a good platform for easy to\nunderstand and feasible accessibility guidelines. </p></p><p></p><p><p>WAI should specify the UAAG requirements,\nwhich match the needs of WCAG 2.0. These guidelines should set technology\ntargets to assistive tools vendors. As soon as a technology target is met by\nthe most of recommended user agents, the corresponding WCAG 2.0 requirement\nshould retire or go to good practices status (level 3).</p></p><p></p><p><p>Our team investigated the WCAG 2.0 draft \n(level 1 and 2) in order to find success criteria, techniques and failures,\nwhich can be resolved by assistive tools. We detected several candidate SCs to be\nremoved or simplified. </p></p><p></p><p><h2>WCAG 2.0 user agent dependant success criteria </h2>\n<!--break--></p><p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#content-structure-separation-emphasis" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 1.3.4">SC 1.3.4</a>\nInformation that is conveyed by variations in presentation of text is also\nconveyed in text, or the variations in presentation of text can be\nprogrammatically determined. (Level 2)</strong>\n</h3></p><p>\n<p>In the other words, if important\ninformation is conveyed in text by using bold, italic or other HTML markup, it\nmust be understandable without markup. WCAG 2.0 proposes two solutions: explain\nthe information using additional text or allow programmatic access to it. </p></p><p></p><p><p>This success criteria is mixing requirement\nto a web content (<q>presentation … conveyed in text</q>) with a requirement to a\nuser agent (<q>presentation … can be programmatically determined</q>). In fact, text\nfont, size, typeface is always can be extracted from a browser. If a browser\nwrites text in bold it knows about it. The assistive tool can get information\nabout text typeface through browser's API. A web developer can not do anything\nto prevent an assistive tool from obtaining this information.</p></p><p></p><p><p>Using this knowledge we can conclude that\nthe related common failure <q><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/Overview.html#F2">F2: Failure of SC 1.3.1 and 1.3.4 due to using CSS\nto create variations in presentation of text that conveys information without\nalso using the appropriate markup or text.</a></q> is not valid. It assures, that a web developer can confuse a user by using not\nappropriate CSS. However a browser shows the <q>NO</q> word in bold and an assistive\ntool (Jaws, for example) can inform a user about bold text regardless the CSS\nclass definition. </p></p><p></p><p><h4>Conclusion.</h4></p><p><p>The modern versions of assistive tools can\ninform a user about markup. Therefore the second part of the SC 1.3.4 is met. WCAG\nWG should consider excluding this success criteria out of the standard body.</p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#visual-audio-contrast-contrast" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria SC 1.4.1">SC 1.4.1</a> Text or diagrams, and their background, have a luminosity contrast ratio of at least 5:1. (Level 2)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>The text contrast problem can be 100%\nresolved by browsers. Both Internet Explorer and FireFox have settings, which define\ntext and background colors on a web page. Furthermore, it is possible to\nimprove the contrast automatically on page, calculation the contrast and\nbrightness using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/appendixA.html#luminosity-contrastdef">W3C formula</a>.\nDo we really need this requirement for text in HTML on the level 2, if it can\nbe fixed by user agents automatically? </p></p><p></p><p><p>The related <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/Overview.html#F24">common failure F24</a>\nprovides examples of code, which does not allow certain (not specified) user\nagents to enable user defined font and background colors. If a browser does not\nallow to change text and background colors, it is a clear user agent problem. Our\nteam tested all these examples using Internet Explorer 6 and 7 beta 3, FireFox\n1.5, Opera. In fact, only IE 6 has problems with the examples 1 and 2. The\nother browsers, including the IE 7, show text with the user defined color and\non the user defined background correctly. Therefore the bug in IE 6 is fixed in\nthe IE 7.0. Read the full <a href="http://www.erigami.com/blog/wcag-color-user-defined/">test report</a>.\n</p></p><p></p><p><p>The real contrast problem is with images\nand applets. There is no automatic way to improve the contrast in this case.\nHowever this situation is covered by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/guidelines.html#text-equiv">WCAG 2.0 success criteria 1.1</a>.\n</p></p><p></p><p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p><p><p>The color contrast problem can be resolved\nby user agents. This is not a real barrier. Therefore this SC should take place\nin the good practices of web accessibility.</p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#visual-audio-contrast-dis-audio" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria SC 1.4.2">SC 1.4.2</a> A mechanism is available to turn off background audio that plays automatically, without requiring the user to turn off all audio. (Level 2)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>Playing sound interferes with the reader\nvoice, which cause problems to disabled users. Internet Explorer has a setting\nto disable audio on a web page (Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced tab\n&gt; Multimedia &gt; Play sounds in web pages). It looks like the problem is\neasy to solve. Unfortunately, it is not. The IE setting rules only HTML background\nsound. It can not disable sound from the ActiveX objects, like Flash. FireFox\ndo not have a sound setting ever. In fact, many users dislike the sound from\nFlash, but currently they have the only option to mute the sound in operation\nsystem. This is not acceptable for screen readers.</p></p><p></p><p><p>The problem is in the Windows operation\nsystem. However it can be resolved. To prove the concept, we conducted a\nresearch and discovered a simple <a href="http://www.erigami.com/blog/disable-sound-firefox-ie/">method to disable Flash and other browser\nsounds</a> in FireFox and\nInternet Explorer. The other Windows sounds keep playing (including Jaws!). </p></p><p></p><p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p><p><p>The problem should be forwarded to\nMicrosoft. They should provide a simple way to block all sounds originated from\na browser and keep readers working.</p></p><p></p><p><h2>Other WCAG 2.0 success criteria where user agents can help</h2>\n<!--break--></p><p>\n<h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#time-limits-blink" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 2.2.2">SC 2.2.2</a>\nContent does not blink for more than three seconds, or a method is available to\nstop all blinking content in the Web unit or authored component. (Level 2)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>Browsers enable text blinking on the\ncorresponding HTML tags. Therefore they can disable it. Stop button in IE7\nblocks animated GIFs, for example. The specific problem is blinking from Flash\nobjects. Microsoft and Adobe should provide an API to stop animations.</p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#consistent-behavior-receive-focus" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 3.2.1">SC 3.2.1</a>\nWhen any component receives focus, it does not cause a change of context.\n(Level 1)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>This SC can be resolved by user agents.\nPopup blockers are very standard today. The other unexpected actions as\nnavigating a browser to a new page on selecting a choice in pull down menu or\nchanging focus on click, can be suspended as well. A user agent can ask a user\nwhether to perform a blocked action.  It seems this requirement is a good\ncandidate for retirement.</p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#consistent-behavior-unpredictable-change" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 3.2.2">SC 3.2.2</a> Changing the setting of any form control or field does not automatically cause\na change of context (beyond moving to the next field in tab order), unless the\nauthored unit contains instructions before the control that describe the\nbehavior. (Level 1)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>This SC is very close to 3.2.1 and can be\nresolved in a similar manner. </p></p><p></p><p><h3><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/Overview.html#meaning-doc-lang-id" title="Web Content Accessibility Success Criteria 3.1.1">SC 3.1.1</a>\nThe primary natural language or languages of the Web unit can be\nprogrammatically determined. (Level 1)</h3></p><p></p><p><p>This SC puts a lot of attention to\nright-to-left language information. In fact, this kind of data is\nprogrammatically determined by browsers, since they need to render\nright-to-left text correctly. The RTL language is programmatically determinable\nby itself, because all they contain unique symbols. So it is quite easy to\ndistinguish between Hebrew and Arabic. In contrast, Polish and Czech are not\neasy to detect automatically, since they share the same character set. If\ndisabled users find it useful, browsers can inform them about RTL content\npresence on a web page.</p></p><p></p><p><h2>Summary of suggestions to WCAG 2.0</h2>\n<!--break--></p><p>\n<ol>\n <li>Define and officially publish the set of\n     user agents for WCAG 2.0. </li>\n <li>Define UAAG requirements, which conform\n     with the WCAG 2.0.
