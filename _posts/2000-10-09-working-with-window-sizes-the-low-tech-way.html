<h3>Background</h3></p><p>Every few weeks another article or two crops up, talking about what a pain it is to create layouts that are &quot;friendly&quot; at one screen resolution when your normal operating environment is different, e.g. it's a good idea to target 800x600 window sizes, but you're running your station at 1280x1024.</p></p><p>Eighteen months ago, I came up with a creative workaround for this problem.</p></p><hr></p><h3>Assumptions you <i>can</i> make</h3></p><p>One nice thing about display environments is that a pixel will always be a pixel (unless the user is a reasonably savvy Windows user who's changed their ppi equivalency and/or window geometry).  A <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/fear4/index.html" target="_new">recent article in A List Apart</a> talks about this convenience.</p></p><p>One of things that follows from this is that regardless of resolution&#151;and excepting the situation posed in the previous paragraph&#151;browser chrome will always have the same <i>pixel</i> dimensions.</p></p><p>Therefore, what matters most are the overall <i>dimensions</i> of the browser window.</p></p><p>This brings us to the desktop and&#151;more specifically&#151;the image that you intend to place on it.</p></p><hr></p><h3>Finally, the solution</h3></p><p>The following assumes that you have access to Photoshop.</p></p><ol><li>Take an image that you've already sampled and cropped to the size of your display.  <a href="http://www.digitalblasphemy.com/" target="_new">digitalblasphemy.com</a> has always been my favorite place to look when I've got time to kill.</li></p><li>Use ascending layers, containing successively smaller rectangles, to represent each full-screen window size, and manipulate their opacity, color, or whatever else to achieve a result <a href="http://www.io.com/persist1/small-su37.gif" target="_new">resembling this</a>.  How you arrange the squares is entirely your own affair; it just so happens that I like to center mine on the desktop.  The important thing is to provide enough contrast so that you can see each outline without straining.</li></ol></p><p>This done, you can put the new image on your desktop and then when it comes time to ask, &quot;what does this design look like at resolution <i>n</i>?&quot; all you have to do is drag inside the lines.  You'll then have a painfully simple way to see how your design renders under various conditions, and not have to do too much guesswork.</p>
