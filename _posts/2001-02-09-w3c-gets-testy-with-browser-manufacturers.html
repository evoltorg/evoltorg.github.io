<p>In an unexpected (but not undeserved) moment of <a href="http://www.useit.com/" title="opens in a new window" target="_foo">Nielsen</a>ism, W3C has published a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/NOTE-cuap-20010206" title="opens in a new window" target="_foo">list of things which browsers should do, but often don't</a>. These aren't so much focused on HTML non-compliance, but on the basic behaviour of browsers such as "<q>Don't treat temporary HTTP redirects as permanent ones</q>"</p></p></p><p></p>The issues which W3C has largely boil down to "<q>Hey! We're not sitting down and producing robust standards for a laugh, y'know</q>"</p>
