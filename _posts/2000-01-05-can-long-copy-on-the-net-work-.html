Basically: if it's interesting copy, well written copy, heck,</p>internet copy, yes. It can work.</p><p><p></p><p>Popular knowledge says long text doesn't work on the net. I</p>disagree. If used properly, it can be very effective.</p>Have you ever kept reading on a webpage, and been</p>disappointed there wasn't any more?</p><p><p></p><p><h3>How not to do it</h3></p>Long text as used in newspapers or</p>books indeed doesn't work on the net. I think most of you will</p>agree with me on that. On the other hand, on some sites</p>text is just too short, and to read more you need to keep</p>going to new pages (to show more ads?), which can be</p>pretty frustrating.</p><p><p></p><p>I think if you follow the </p><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.htm">rules </p>for internet writing</a></p>(make it</p>scannable, conclusions first, good subtitles, one idea per</p>paragraph and so on), long texts can work pretty well. Have</p>a look at <a href="http://selfpromotion.com">selfpromotion.com</a> -- </p>it's all text, and although it's</p>not perfect, it keeps you reading (me at least).</p><p><p></p><p><h3>So how to do it</h3></p>A few more rules that work for me: </p><p><ol></p><li><b>keep rewriting</b></p><p>Most writers know this, but if you're an</p>average Joe like me, this is rule number one. After writing</p>something, let it be for a day and rewrite thoroughly. And</p>then rewrite again. And spellcheck. If you can, have</p>somebody read it (editor).</p><p><p></p><p>I think the main problem for content on the web these days</p>is that people don't work hard enough on their copy (yes,</p>that includes me).</p><p></p><li><b>conclusion first!</b> </p><p></p>Put your conclusion first. There can be</p>no laps of interest (where a reader looses interest) in your</p>article, or they'll loose appetite and start clicking. So put</p>the</p>juicy stuff first, and keep feeding them. (I'm gonna end this</p>eating metaphor right here before it gets out of hand.)</p><p><p></p><p>Will they still wanna read on if you give them the good stuff</p>right away? I think they will. If you give them something</p>really good, people will want to know more about it.</p><p><p></p><p>And put content on that page! I'm always amazed by how</p>many sites want you to click 2 or 3 times before getting to</p>the good stuff. Content on the homepage!</p><p></ol></p><p><h3>Further reading</h3></p>Have a look at </p><a href="http://www.ini.cz/pearls/pearls1.htm">string of pearls</a>. It kind of</p>disagrees with all I said here, but I find it very</p>interesting.</p>And useit.com has a classic on </p><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html">How </p>people read on the web</a>.</p><p><p></p><p>What do you think? Can long copy really work? Does</p>everything HAVE to be divided into lots of sub-pages? Why</p>not just throw it all on one page? Or should it be serial, like</p>the string of pearls pages?
