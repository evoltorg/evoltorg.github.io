Many a\n   site has been ruined by poor use of them.  But\n   frames don't have to be evil.  I have seen lots\n   of great sites that use frames, but I have also\n   seen lots of sites that don't need frames.  If\n   frames are well-designed, they can make a good\n   site better.  But I don't have time to get into\n   how to do that.  I am going to show you how to\n   fix a problem on many framed sites.  Bookmarks.\n</p></p><p><h2>The Problem</h2></p><p><p>\n   Have you ever found framed page that looked interesting,\n   but didn't have time to read it, so you bookmarked it\n   and when you returned, you were stuck and couldn't find\n   your page? Have you ever wondered if that happens to your\n   site?  Depending on how complex your site is, you may be\n   losing visitors because of that.\n</p></p><p><p>\n   What happens?  You bookmarked the frameset document, and\n   when you return, your browser reads the source and opens\n   the main page in to the main content frame.  You want a\n   way to get around that?  Well, that comes next.\n</p></p><p><h2>The Solution</h2></p><p><p>\n   If you look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/code"\n   title="Microsoft's Code Center" target="_blank">Microsoft\n   Developer's Code Center</a> you see that they found a solution\n   that is very similar to the one I am going to show you.  At the\n   top of the page, there is a link: "Get Page URL".  If you click\n   on the link, the page will appear to refresh, but the address bar\n   now says <code>http://msdn.microsoft.com/code/default.asp?URL=/code/welcome.asp</code>.\n   If you bookmark that page, you will always go to the frameset\n   with welcome.asp in the main content frame.  I am going to show\n   you how to do this in PHP.\n</p></p><p><h3>Step One: Minor Changes</h3></p><p><p>\n   In your document in the main content frame, put in the following code:\n</p></p><p><pre>\n&lt;a href=&quot;index.php?content=main.html&quot; title=&quot;Synchronize the current page with the address bar&quot;&gt;Sync Address Bar&lt;/a&gt;\n</pre></p><p><p>\n   where index.php is the url of your frameset page (if it's not a PHP file,\n   make it one by renaming it).  In the <code><em>?content=mypage.html</em></code>\n   part, main.html is the current html page (the document in the main content\n   frame).  The link will look something like this:\n</p></p><p><p>\n<a href="index.php?content=main.html" title="Synchronize the current page with the address bar" target="_blank" onClick="return false">Sync Address Bar</a>  (This link will not work; click all you want)\n</p></p><p><p>\nNote:  Put this on every page you want your visitors to be able\n   to bookmark or find the exact URL.\n</p></p><p><h3>Step Two: The Framework</h3></p><p><p>\n   In your frameset page (which should now be a PHP file), put the following\n   PHP script at the top of the document:\n</p></p><p><pre>\n&lt;?php\n&nbsp;// If there is no content variable,\n&nbsp;// assign the value &quot;main.html&quot; to\n&nbsp;// the variable.\n&nbsp;if (!content) {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;$content == &quot;index.html&quot;;\n&nbsp;}\n?&gt;\n</pre></p><p><p>\nNow for your frame source for the main content frame, add the following\n   PHP into the src attribute for the frame:\n</p></p><p><p>\n<code>&lt;?php echo("$content"); ?&gt;</code>\n</p></p><p><p>\n   Your entire framed page would look something like this:\n</p></p><p><pre>\n&lt;!-- index.php --&gt;\n&lt;?php\n&nbsp;// If there is no content variable,\n&nbsp;// assign the value &quot;main.html&quot; to\n&nbsp;// the variable.\n&nbsp;if (!content) {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;$content == &quot;index.html&quot;;\n&nbsp;} \n?&gt; \n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;\nMy Framed Page\n&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;frameset cols=&quot;100,*&quot;&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;frame src=&quot;nav.html&quot;&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;frame src=&quot;&lt;?php echo(&quot;$content&quot;)?&gt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/frameset&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre></p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p><p>\n  Of course this isn't the only way to offer a solution for bookmarks.\n  You could make a top frame with the Sync Url link, add more frames,\n  and the list goes on and on.  This article only went into the very\n  basic way of doing this.  I tried to keep it as simple as possible,\n  and you can tweak it on your own to make it work for your site.\n  Also, if you don't use PHP, this could also easily be translated into\n  another server side language.  Again, I don't have time to get into that.\n  Have fun with this script, and don't let any more of your users get\n  caught by the URL/bookmark/favorites problem again.  \n</p>
