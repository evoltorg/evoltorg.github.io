Many a</p>   site has been ruined by poor use of them.  But</p>   frames don't have to be evil.  I have seen lots</p>   of great sites that use frames, but I have also</p>   seen lots of sites that don't need frames.  If</p>   frames are well-designed, they can make a good</p>   site better.  But I don't have time to get into</p>   how to do that.  I am going to show you how to</p>   fix a problem on many framed sites.  Bookmarks.</p></p></p><p><h2>The Problem</h2></p><p><p></p>   Have you ever found framed page that looked interesting,</p>   but didn't have time to read it, so you bookmarked it</p>   and when you returned, you were stuck and couldn't find</p>   your page? Have you ever wondered if that happens to your</p>   site?  Depending on how complex your site is, you may be</p>   losing visitors because of that.</p></p></p><p><p></p>   What happens?  You bookmarked the frameset document, and</p>   when you return, your browser reads the source and opens</p>   the main page in to the main content frame.  You want a</p>   way to get around that?  Well, that comes next.</p></p></p><p><h2>The Solution</h2></p><p><p></p>   If you look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/code"</p>   title="Microsoft's Code Center" target="_blank">Microsoft</p>   Developer's Code Center</a> you see that they found a solution</p>   that is very similar to the one I am going to show you.  At the</p>   top of the page, there is a link: "Get Page URL".  If you click</p>   on the link, the page will appear to refresh, but the address bar</p>   now says <code>http://msdn.microsoft.com/code/default.asp?URL=/code/welcome.asp</code>.</p>   If you bookmark that page, you will always go to the frameset</p>   with welcome.asp in the main content frame.  I am going to show</p>   you how to do this in PHP.</p></p></p><p><h3>Step One: Minor Changes</h3></p><p><p></p>   In your document in the main content frame, put in the following code:</p></p></p><p><pre></p>&lt;a href=&quot;index.php?content=main.html&quot; title=&quot;Synchronize the current page with the address bar&quot;&gt;Sync Address Bar&lt;/a&gt;</p></pre></p><p><p></p>   where index.php is the url of your frameset page (if it's not a PHP file,</p>   make it one by renaming it).  In the <code><em>?content=mypage.html</em></code></p>   part, main.html is the current html page (the document in the main content</p>   frame).  The link will look something like this:</p></p></p><p><p></p><a href="index.php?content=main.html" title="Synchronize the current page with the address bar" target="_blank" onClick="return false">Sync Address Bar</a>  (This link will not work; click all you want)</p></p></p><p><p></p>Note:  Put this on every page you want your visitors to be able</p>   to bookmark or find the exact URL.</p></p></p><p><h3>Step Two: The Framework</h3></p><p><p></p>   In your frameset page (which should now be a PHP file), put the following</p>   PHP script at the top of the document:</p></p></p><p><pre></p>&lt;?php</p>&nbsp;// If there is no content variable,</p>&nbsp;// assign the value &quot;main.html&quot; to</p>&nbsp;// the variable.</p>&nbsp;if (!content) {</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;$content == &quot;index.html&quot;;</p>&nbsp;}</p>?&gt;</p></pre></p><p><p></p>Now for your frame source for the main content frame, add the following</p>   PHP into the src attribute for the frame:</p></p></p><p><p></p><code>&lt;?php echo("$content"); ?&gt;</code></p></p></p><p><p></p>   Your entire framed page would look something like this:</p></p></p><p><pre></p>&lt;!-- index.php --&gt;</p>&lt;?php</p>&nbsp;// If there is no content variable,</p>&nbsp;// assign the value &quot;main.html&quot; to</p>&nbsp;// the variable.</p>&nbsp;if (!content) {</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;$content == &quot;index.html&quot;;</p>&nbsp;} </p>?&gt; </p>&lt;html&gt;</p>&lt;head&gt;</p>&lt;title&gt;</p>My Framed Page</p>&lt;/title&gt;</p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>&lt;frameset cols=&quot;100,*&quot;&gt;</p>&nbsp;&lt;frame src=&quot;nav.html&quot;&gt;</p>&nbsp;&lt;frame src=&quot;&lt;?php echo(&quot;$content&quot;)?&gt;&quot;&gt;</p>&lt;/frameset&gt;</p>&lt;/html&gt;</p></pre></p><p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p><p></p>  Of course this isn't the only way to offer a solution for bookmarks.</p>  You could make a top frame with the Sync Url link, add more frames,</p>  and the list goes on and on.  This article only went into the very</p>  basic way of doing this.  I tried to keep it as simple as possible,</p>  and you can tweak it on your own to make it work for your site.</p>  Also, if you don't use PHP, this could also easily be translated into</p>  another server side language.  Again, I don't have time to get into that.</p>  Have fun with this script, and don't let any more of your users get</p>  caught by the URL/bookmark/favorites problem again.  </p></p>
