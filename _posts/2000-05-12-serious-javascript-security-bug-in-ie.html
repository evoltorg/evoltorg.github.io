<a href="http://www.peacefire.org" target="_blank">Peacefire</a> have issued an advisory about a serious new exploit to read any cookie in Internet Explorer.</p>                                       </p><p>The bug allows a malicious Javascript to retrieve the content of any cookie stored by IE. Peacefire have <a href="http://www.peacefire.org/security/iecookies" target="newwindow">several examples</a>, including a scenario in which a website can obtain the user's cookie for Amazon, and somebody could then use this cookie to log in to Amazon as that user.<p></p>Peacefire's advice to disable this bug is for <b>anybody</b> using Internet Explorer to immediately disable Javascript. For extra security, turning the acceptance of cookies off is also recommended.<p></p>As yet, Microsoft have yet to issue an advisory about this bug, although even if they do, it can be expected that it will take some time for them to issue a fix.<p></p>As with most IE bugs, this only affects Internet Explorer running on a Windows platform. Mac and Unix platforms are unaffected, as are Netscape browsers.<p></p>
