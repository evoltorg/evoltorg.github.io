<h2>The Future If Presenting Data</h2></p><p><p>The future of the Web will revolve around using full CSS web layouts rather than table-based Web design.\nThe difference is in positioning DIV areas with CSS, rather than using tables to hold the content together,\nwhich should be reserved for presenting data.</p></p><p><h3>Why Table-Based Web Design is Bad Form</h3></p><p><p>Tables are designed to display tabular data; not for creative Web page layouts. However, that doesn't mean\nwe should get rid of, or ignore, tables completely in our markup. Tables are still a vital part of HTML,\nas they retain their usefulness in marking up tabular data such as calendars.</p></p><p><p>Here are a few reasons that table-based design has become bad form in Web design:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In table-based design, a website's content and markup are combined in one document, making page file sizes\nunnecessarily large. This forces site visitors to download presentational table data for every page they visit on a site.</li></p><p><li>Table-based design can make it hard to maintain visual consistency throughout a site.</li></p><p><li>It's much more difficult to design a table-based Web layout that complies with accessibility\nlaws and standards for the disabled or those accessing the Web via cell phones and PDAs.\nFor example, an audio browser will typically read the contents of a table from left to right and top to bottom.\nIf a designer uses tables to layout a site's content in a vertical fashion (with the intention to read content down the first column,\nthen to the top of the second column, etc.), the screen reader will be reading content out of order, causing confusion to the listener.</li></p><p><li>Markup language isn't intended to define display elements of a document, despite the fact\nthat display and structural elements are oftenintimately connected.</li>\n</ul></p><p><h3>Benefits of Using CSS in Web Design</h3></p><p><p><strong>Semantic Mark-up</strong> - It's easier to achieve a semantic mark-up (strongly recommended by w3c) using CSS design.\nWhat this means is that code should be meaningful as well as syntactically correct. In order to have semantic meaning,\nyour DIVs should be assigned descriptive IDs (eg., Assign &lt;div id="content"&gt; to your main content area,\nwrap headings in &lt;h1&gt; tags, subheadings in &lt;h2&gt; tags, paragraphs in &lt;p&gt; tags, etc.\nIt also means using &lt;strong&gt; tags as opposed to &lt;b&gt; tags for bold text and &lt;em&gt;\ntags instead of &lt;i&gt; tags for italicized or emphasized text.)\nEssentially, the descriptive IDs allow your markup to convey meaning to the reader.</p></p><p><p><strong>Less Bandwidth Usage</strong> - When using CSS design techniques, a site's actual HTML files are separate from your CSS markup,\nwith both files being caches separately in the browser. This saves bandwidth, because the CSS file detailing design elements\nonly has to be downloaded by the visitor once, as opposed to table-based designs, where the full layout must be downloaded\nwith every page load. By converting a table-based Web design into a CSS design, you can often decrease the page size by 50-60%.</p></p><p><p><strong>Better SEO</strong> - CSS designs are better for your search engine optimization efforts, because CSS allows you to separate the page's\nstructure from its presentation elements.  This improves your code to content ratio (under the concept that the more text versus\ncode is present in your page, the better your site will rank in search engines because of relevancy factors).</p></p><p><img src="http://www.redflymarketing.com/media/rfm.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:10px" />\n<p><em>Image Credit: <a href="http://www.redflymarketing.com">www.RedFlyMarketing.com</a></em></p>\n<p><em>The RedFly Marketing homepage demonstrates the SEO benefit of content positioning in a CSS Web layout. If this design were\ncreated in a table-based layout, search engines would read the left column's content (less important) before the main content\narea in the center of the page (most important for SEO purposes to determine relevancy of keywords in a page).</em></p></p><p><p>This can also aid in displaying more relevant contextual ads when using contextual advertising networks such as\nGoogle Adsense or the Yahoo! Publisher Network, which can lead to increased conversions and income. By minimizing\nthe amount of code as compared to content, you're also making it easier for search engines to spider your site,\ndue to the fact that the code is more structured and simplified.</p></p><p><p>Yet another SEO benefit of CSS design is that a designer has the ability to manipulate the order of data as\nit will be presented to search engines. This means that the most important areas of a site (such as the main content block)\ncan be placed earlier in the site's code than a less important element (such as a sidebar navigational menu).</p></p><p><p><strong>Easier Design Changes</strong> - CSS design makes it much easier to make small changes to design elements sitewide\n(such as content fonts or colors), because a single value changed in a single stylesheet can instantly change\nthe appearance of an element across an entire website, where all pages are referencing the same CSS file.\nEven complete site redesigns are much easier, because the complete layout of the site is controlled through one external CSS file.</p></p><p><p><strong>Better Accessibility</strong> - Accessibility is greatly enhanced with the use of CSS. CSS-based layouts allow multiple\nWeb-enabled devices (such as PDAs, cell phones, and TV-based browsers) to draw on the same source pages, all while\nbeing displayed in entirely different styles.  The same is true of "printer-friendly" pages, where using a simple\nalternative CSS file will remove images and navigation for a printable display of content. Essentially, one page serves all purposes.</p></p><p><p><em>Image Credits: <a href="http://www.redflystudios.com">www.RedFlyStudios.com</a></em></p></p><p><p><em>The following images display how one Web page can be displayed in a Web-friendly format as well as a printer-friendly format\nusing a single CSS file. Both images below are from the RedFly Studios homepage. Figure 1 illustrates the homepage as displayed\non the Web, while Figure 2 illustrates the same page displayed in its printer-friendly format (minus the large header graphic).</em></p></p><p><p><strong>Figure 1 Web Display</strong><br />\n<img src="http://www.redflymarketing.com/media/rfs-layout.jpg" /></p>\n   </p><p><p><strong>Figure 2: Print Display</strong><br />\n<img src="http://www.redflymarketing.com/media/rfs-print.jpg" /></p>\n \n<h3>Potential Challenges of CSS Layouts</h3></p><p><p><strong>Browser Compatibility</strong> - While the latest browser versions have little problem with displaying CSS-based Web designs,\nolder browsers such as Netscape Navigator 4.x and Internet Explorer 4.x and earlier can only display very basic CSS commands,\nwhereas more complex stylesheets can cause display problems.</p></p><p><p><strong>Difficulty in Switching from Tables to CSS</strong> - Using CSS for Web layouts requires a different line of thinking than using tables.\nThis means that some designers may have trouble adapting from a table-based design method that they've used for years to CSS-based design.</p></p><p><h3>Layout Examples - A Simple 3-Column Fixed Width Layout</h3></p><p><h4>1.) Table-Based Layout</h4>\n<code>\n<table width="760"  border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan="3">HEADER</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width="180">LEFT</td>\n    <td>CONTENT</td>\n    <td width="180">RIGHT</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td colspan="3">FOOTER</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</code></p><p><h4>2.) CSS Layout</h4></p><p><p><strong>The CSS</strong></p>\n<code>\nbody {\n	text-align:center; /*required for centering the page in IE */\n	}\n#wrapper {\n	text-align: left;\n	margin: 0px auto; /* centering the page */\n	padding: 0px;\n	border:0;\n	width: 760px; /* width of the page */\n}\n#header {\n	margin: 0 0 15px 0;\n	height: 50px;\n}\n#left {\n	float: left;\n	width: 180px;\n}\n#right {\n	float: right;\n	width: 180px;\n}\n#content { \n	float: left;\n	width: 400px;\n}\n#footer {\n	clear: both;\n	height: 30px;\n}\n</code>\n<br />\n<p><strong>The HTML</strong></p>\n<code>\n<div id="wrapper">\n	<div id="header">HEADER</div>\n	<div id="container">\n		<div id="left">LEFT</div>\n		<div id="content">CONTENT</div>\n		<div id="right">RIGHT</div>\n	</div>\n	<div id="footer">FOOTER</div>\n</div>\n</code>\n<p>When it comes to professional Web design, using CSS and semantic HTML is the only way to go moving forward.\nIf you are a beginner, hopefully the above example will give you a good starting point, in demonstrating the simplification of code in CSS design.</p>\n</p>There are plenty of resources on the Internet that can help you learn more about CSS and semantic HTML, so stick with it and learn\nhow you can make the Web a better place!</p>\n<br />\n<p><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/synd/2002/03/01/css_layout.html">http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/synd/2002/03/01/css_layout.html</a></p></p><p><p><a href="http://newsletter.refinery.com/e_article000166191.cfm">http://newsletter.refinery.com/e_article000166191.cfm</a></p></p><p><p><a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2003/02/21/tables-vs-css">http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2003/02/21/tables-vs-css</a></p>\n
