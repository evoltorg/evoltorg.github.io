My Picks, Have the   PowerPoint Slides Untouched and to be Shared! <br /></p>Share your PowerPoint slide   show without computer <br /></p><br /></p>Have this ever happened to you? You’ve   created a compelling PowerPoint slide show with sound tracks and movie clips   embedded, however，you have no choice but attach the huge package in an email to   share it with others (If the file is larger than 2M, it is always unable to be   sent by email), or save it in a flash drive and deliver the hard copy. <br /></p>The   problem is, what if the recipients do not have computer or it is not convenient   to use a computer? <br /></p>I’ll never forget those awkward moments I had in the   past: <br /></p>I created a PowerPoint photo slide show with engaging video and audio,   but when I showed it to others on another computer, I found it was too slow to   open the big PowerPoint file, and the attached media files can not be properly   played during the presentation. <br /></p>When I was ready to send it to my friends, I   found some of my friends have no computer to view the slide show. What a pity   that I have no way to send it to them! What’s more, my father almost hadn’t used   computer, how can I get a clue to enable him to view my slide show? <br /></p><br /></p>Needless to say, the effort I spent on the presentations returned   nothing to me but only complaints from audiences, pities of no way to share with   friends, and lost opportunities with the customers if it is a business   presentation. <br /></p><br /></p>Is there a way to wipe out these inconveniences? <br /></p><br /></p>After making a few searches, I found there are mainly two methods to   solve the problem. <br /></p>1. Using a screen capture tool to convert PowerPoint   slide show to video (Not Recommended) <br /></p>By converting PowerPoint slide show to   video then burn to DVD, It is free to send the DVD to others without worrying   about whether they have PowerPoint viewer or even a computer. We can find a   television and a DVD Player almost anywhere to play the presentation DVD. <br /></p>But the resulting DVD generated from video can not be controlled by a DVD   remote control like controlling in PowerPoint. I’ve tried Camtasia studio and   some other similar screen capture tools, they all have the same problem. <br /></p>2.   Using a professional PowerPoint to DVD burning tool (Recommended) <br /></p>A   professional PowerPoint to DVD burning tool can burn PowerPoint to DVD directly   with almost all the PowerPoint slide show elements retained. Such as internal   hyperlinks, slide transitions, animations, video and audio. You can also   generate DVD menus to navigate audiences, and control the playback such as the   slide “Next” and “previous” by a DVD remote just like you control the slide show   playback in PowerPoint. And a professional PowerPoint to DVD tool mostly   includes the function of converting PowerPoint to video. <br /></p><br /></p>So it is better   to use a professional PowerPoint to DVD burning tool to burn PowerPoint to DVD. <br /></p><br /></p>I was very lucky that I got a free copy of Wondershare DVD Presenter via <a href="http://www.giveawayoftheday.com/dvd-presenter" target="_blank">http://www.giveawayoftheday.com/dvd-presenter</a> , as it’s free,   I’m aware that I can’t use it for commercial usage. However I would like to   offer a big thanks to GOATD and Wondershare, as I can finally created the DVD   presentation with flexible DVD menus. I found with the DVD conversion, the   control over menus and end-menus was nice, as well as scaling the video so that   it doesn’t lose data from standard television bleed-over (The ‘safe’ zone.) So   many applications overlook this aspect and give you a full-screen DVD, with a   good portion of your information/text off the side of the screen. You can either   have it placed directly to DVD, or set up an ISO if you by some chance want to   alter the ISO (or save a backup for repeated copies.) <br /></p><br /></p>A terrific   advantage of the program is that it gives me the capability to get my   presentations to those who don’t have PowerPoint, or indeed, a computer. Anyone   can view my PowerPoint slide show on any DVD player worldwide and as I am   writing this, the cogs are turning as I contemplate creating promotional DVDs   for my business with this genuinely amazing program. <br /></p><br /></p>Although there is a   tutorial can help people burn PowerPoint to DVD with DVD Presenter step by step,   it is nearly no use to me. I can’t vouch for more experienced and seasoned   users, but if you, like me, are just delving into the media frenzy, I’d say   definitely give it a try. <br /></p>It is simple just like 1-2-3. <br /></p>Take an overview   of its easy to handle user interface: <br /></p><img src="http://www.sameshow.com/images/powerpoint-to-dvd/intuitive.jpg" border="0" /> <br /></p>Every step is very clear. <br /></p><img src="http://www.sameshow.com/images/powerpoint-to-dvd/layout1.jpg" border="0" /> <br /></p><br /></p>The tool can be downloaded from its official site: <a href="http://www.sameshow.com/powerpoint-to-dvd.html" target="_blank">http://www.sameshow.com/powerpoint-to-dvd.html</a> <br /></p><br /></p>Now,   with a small DVD, I can share my PowerPoint slide show anywhere with a DVD   Player and TV, or send it to friends or customers worldwide without any   restriction. <br /></p>You may download the sample of the tool and evaluate it by   yourself: <br /></p>Sample size : 10.7M <br /></p>Download URL: <a href="http://download.sameshow.com/sample/sample.rar" target="_blank">http://download.sameshow.com/sample/sample.rar</a> <br /></p>Sample   format: VOB <br /></p>Player Require : Windows Media Player
