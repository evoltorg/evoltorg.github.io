The small but very fine browser Opera, which has a loyal customer base, has a new beta out.</p>You can get it at <a href="http://www.opera.com/download.html" target="_blank">their site</a>.</p>         </p><P>Two good resources are also the <a href="http://sue-sims.nu/opera/resources/feature-requests.html" target="_blank">feature request site</a> and the <a href="http://sue-sims.nu/opera/resources/40-issues.html" target="_new">known issues</a>.</p><p>Btw, Opera will also ship as the default browser for Psion PDAs in the future.<br></p></p></p><p>It supports XML! (<a href="http://www.opera.com/news/20000411.html" target="_blank">more</a> </p>  about XML from Opera)</p></p><p>From another <a href="http://www.opera.com/news/20000328.html" target="_blank">release</a>:<br></p>  &quot; Opera 4.0 Upgrades File Exchange: Includes HTTP 1.1 <br></p>  ..<br></p>  HTTP 1.1 is the name of the latest version and it is included in Opera 4.0.</p></p><p>doing more, doing it faster<br></p>  Who cares that the language of Web communication is changing? You do -- Because </p>  this version of HTTP provides higher end-user performance. <br></p>  It does more and it does it faster. This is great for web surfers and especially </p>  good for Opera users, because Opera 4.0 has HTTP 1.1.</p></p><p>prevents eavesdropping of passwords<br></p>  It is also more secure. HTTP 1.1 is more secure because while you authenticate </p>  yourself, it does not allow eavesdropping. <br></p>  This is an important step, increasing security on the web.</p></p><p>give me something faster<br></p>  Security is great. I&#146;m glad my passwords aren&#146;t being passed around. </p>  Yes, and Opera is very secure (we&#146;ll save that for another time). <br></p>  Opera with HTTP 1.1 is even faster.</p></p><p>HTTP 1.1 is faster because it allows persistent connections. Persistent connections </p>  benefit networks and end-users. <br></p>  HTTP 1.1 increases performance by allowing persistent connections; pipelining, </p>  caching, and IP address preservation.<br></p>  ..<br></p>  Pipelining allows Opera to make multiple requests without waiting for an answer. </p>  <br></p>  Basically it is the difference between calling someone multiple times asking </p>  for different items versus calling once with a list. <br></p>  A list is obviously more efficient!</p></p><p>Chunking is the splitting up of documents. Once chunked the document can be </p>  sent over a persistent connection through a pipeline. <br></p>  Each chunk is a known length so by splitting up the document in chunks even </p>  documents that have no known length can be sent.</p></p><p>headers used for cache verification have been expanded<br></p>  There is more cache control. Opera is served more details. These details expand </p>  the caching capabilities because they allow more information to be held.<br></p>  Information like how old a document is, how long before it should be refreshed, </p>  or if it should be checked every time.</p></p><p>HTTP 1.1 Under the Hood<br></p>  HTTP 1.1 has furthered the speed of Opera. <br></p>  Opera is serving you documents faster, and with HTTP 1.1 increasing the general </p>  efficiency of the Web. <br></p>  It is relieving congestion and utilizing better methods of caching. <br></p>  Additionally, it is providing a little extra security when sending your passwords. </p>  HTTP 1.1 is a great item to have under the hood in Opera 4.0.&quot;</p></p><p>Sounds great, doesn't it?<br></p>  Check it out. <br></p>  Feel free to disagree, but I think Opera did more for standards then MS and Netscaper/AOL </p>  together the last two years.</p>
