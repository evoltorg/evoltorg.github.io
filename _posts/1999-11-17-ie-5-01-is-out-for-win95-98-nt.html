Internet Explorer 5.01 has been made available for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/default.asp" target="_new">download from Microsoft</a>. It is not on any of the local mirrors (<a href="http://www.tucows.com/" target="_new">tucows</a>, <a href="http://download.cnet.com/" target="_new">download.com</a>, <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/">evolt archive</a>, etc.), and I haven't heard any fanfare about it yet. It's also funny that a beta copy of Windows2000 (RC1) that I tried out over two months ago came with a browser that reported itself as 5.01. The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/Ie/default.htm" target="_new">IE homepage</a> at MS doesn't even have a "what's new in this release" page, so it's too early to say whether or not their standards support has increased any. I'd comment on it's CSS support if I could download and try it tonight, but their servers are bogged down with security patch downloads (my copy of Win98 just alerted me to 4 new patches that were released today). <P> <P>
