<p>Things that are useful to know when entering international \nmarkets                                                                                                                                \n-- </p></p><p><p>Let's assume you are a small American company with plans to \nenter other markets, because you are aware of the possibilities \nthat exist in those relatively new markets compared to United \nStates.</p></p><p><p>Like in all other issues with potential clients, you have \nto approach your    clients, make them feel comfortable. \nHow should you do that?</p> </p><p><p>First, research if your product is allowed or wanted in the \nEuropean market (we use this one as a broad example). For \nexample if you are selling weapons or medicals over the \nInternet, you should be well familiar with the law situation \nin the country you would like to target. Those rather extreme \nexamples are not the norm. But a little legal and market \nresearch always helps later if done properly.</p></p><p><p>One thing can be made a general rule -- most overseas \ncountries pay much more for \ntheir online time (provider costs AND phone costs), so \nkeep that in mind for general planning. \nThis means design for low bandwidth clients, do not use \nspectacular tricks that are more annoying than useful for \nsomeone who pays to wait for his screen to load. \nIt can be essential for someone who \nis interested in your product.</p></p><p><p>Now that you have found out your product would fit \ngreat in the target market, you should take other measures. \nTo make your visitors comfortable, use their language. \nWhile it is true that English is the <em>lingua franca</em> \nof the Internet, there is already a trend in the use\nof other languages on the Internet. Some estimate this \nnumber to be rising sharply in the next years to come.</p></p><p><h4>Translation</h4></p><p><p>First, be sure you translate all that is important to \nthe client,  for example terms of use and agreement. \nHow would you react if you ordered something \nfrom Taiwan in English, and when you wanted to find out more \nabout the company and their shipment order, to be taken to \nan untranslated Taiwanese page? You would be out in a second -- \nif they do not care about you to understand all in your language, \nthen you are gone. The same applies to your  \ninternational customers. The rise of the Internet in all parts \nof life also leads to more people on the Internet who cannot \nspeak English, or did not learn it very well at school. </p></p><p><p>One more tip for all American companies: if you do not ship to \nother countries, or only with restrictions, please state so \nfrankly and visibly or easily accessible on all pages, or at \nleast the homepage. You cannot imagine the anger and frustration \n(and therefore bad reputation of your company) if an international \nclient fills out  orders, only to find out after \nhalf an hour online time and costs that your company does not \ncare about non-American visitors.</p></p><p><p>But this is the big chance for your small company compared \nto a big corporation!</p></p><p><p>To do it right, let the site get translated for you -- it is \nvery frustrating trying to read a page translated from an \nautomatic program.  Better leave it untranslated before you \ndo it automatically, the results are more hilarious than \ninformative about you and your company (and of course I assume \nyou do not want to make a negative impression).</p></p><p><p>After you have your site or the relevant content translated,  \nit is very important to let someone check it who has this \nlanguage as natural background and also comes from the same \ncultural background as the market you are trying to enter. \nYou avoid misspellings, embarrassing cultural differences \nif not taken care of, and most important, your content gets a \nnatural cultural &quot;feeling&quot; -- spellings \nor phrases that are totally unnatural \nto the native customer are not in the text then.</p></p><p><p>Now the next step.  Even if you cannot for time and \nfinancial reasons take the steps mentioned above now or \nin the very near future, read on, there are things you can \ndo now with minimal effort with the future in the mind.</p></p><p><h4>Domain registrations</h4></p><p><p>You may already have a .com or other Top domain. \nWe all know how fast domain names are being taken, \nmaybe you experienced that problem yourself by not getting \nthe domain name you were looking for. German (.de) domains \nrecently sold their first million.</p></p><p><p>So to preserve rights, product names, and other \ntrademarks, try to get your name in the market you are \ninterested in now, before you face later possible legal \nfights and bad reputation among the web community. The best \nto preserve your rights is to register those domain names \nbefore you have trouble with your competition doing the \nregistration instead of you. Domain names are gold in the \nnew economy. Be sure to save your place on the Internet frontier.</p></p><p><p>For those of you longer on the Internet, you might \nremember the times when domain names were strictly given \nonly to the ones that they belong to, according to \nsome domain rules and guidelines.</p></p><p><p>Since that time we have seen a massive change on the Internet \nand also in domain policies. Not only have lots of new \nregistrars come into the game, but also some new top level domains \nhave been added, and many loosened their policies in order \nto fulfill the new needs.</p></p><p><p>It is interesting to note that there are many different \nrules out there. Some restrict their services only to local \nproven companies or departments while others sell to anyone \nwilling to pay the cash for it. We have been looking at the \nEuropean market first, but I recommend you also look for \navailable domain names from other countries, .cc for Coco Island \nfor example, or others with a nice ending.</p></p><p><p><b>Good luck!</b></p>
