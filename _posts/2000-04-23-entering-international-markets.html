<p>Things that are useful to know when entering international </p>markets                                                                                                                                </p>-- </p></p><p><p>Let's assume you are a small American company with plans to </p>enter other markets, because you are aware of the possibilities </p>that exist in those relatively new markets compared to United </p>States.</p></p><p><p>Like in all other issues with potential clients, you have </p>to approach your    clients, make them feel comfortable. </p>How should you do that?</p> </p><p><p>First, research if your product is allowed or wanted in the </p>European market (we use this one as a broad example). For </p>example if you are selling weapons or medicals over the </p>Internet, you should be well familiar with the law situation </p>in the country you would like to target. Those rather extreme </p>examples are not the norm. But a little legal and market </p>research always helps later if done properly.</p></p><p><p>One thing can be made a general rule -- most overseas </p>countries pay much more for </p>their online time (provider costs AND phone costs), so </p>keep that in mind for general planning. </p>This means design for low bandwidth clients, do not use </p>spectacular tricks that are more annoying than useful for </p>someone who pays to wait for his screen to load. </p>It can be essential for someone who </p>is interested in your product.</p></p><p><p>Now that you have found out your product would fit </p>great in the target market, you should take other measures. </p>To make your visitors comfortable, use their language. </p>While it is true that English is the <em>lingua franca</em> </p>of the Internet, there is already a trend in the use</p>of other languages on the Internet. Some estimate this </p>number to be rising sharply in the next years to come.</p></p><p><h4>Translation</h4></p><p><p>First, be sure you translate all that is important to </p>the client,  for example terms of use and agreement. </p>How would you react if you ordered something </p>from Taiwan in English, and when you wanted to find out more </p>about the company and their shipment order, to be taken to </p>an untranslated Taiwanese page? You would be out in a second -- </p>if they do not care about you to understand all in your language, </p>then you are gone. The same applies to your  </p>international customers. The rise of the Internet in all parts </p>of life also leads to more people on the Internet who cannot </p>speak English, or did not learn it very well at school. </p></p><p><p>One more tip for all American companies: if you do not ship to </p>other countries, or only with restrictions, please state so </p>frankly and visibly or easily accessible on all pages, or at </p>least the homepage. You cannot imagine the anger and frustration </p>(and therefore bad reputation of your company) if an international </p>client fills out  orders, only to find out after </p>half an hour online time and costs that your company does not </p>care about non-American visitors.</p></p><p><p>But this is the big chance for your small company compared </p>to a big corporation!</p></p><p><p>To do it right, let the site get translated for you -- it is </p>very frustrating trying to read a page translated from an </p>automatic program.  Better leave it untranslated before you </p>do it automatically, the results are more hilarious than </p>informative about you and your company (and of course I assume </p>you do not want to make a negative impression).</p></p><p><p>After you have your site or the relevant content translated,  </p>it is very important to let someone check it who has this </p>language as natural background and also comes from the same </p>cultural background as the market you are trying to enter. </p>You avoid misspellings, embarrassing cultural differences </p>if not taken care of, and most important, your content gets a </p>natural cultural &quot;feeling&quot; -- spellings </p>or phrases that are totally unnatural </p>to the native customer are not in the text then.</p></p><p><p>Now the next step.  Even if you cannot for time and </p>financial reasons take the steps mentioned above now or </p>in the very near future, read on, there are things you can </p>do now with minimal effort with the future in the mind.</p></p><p><h4>Domain registrations</h4></p><p><p>You may already have a .com or other Top domain. </p>We all know how fast domain names are being taken, </p>maybe you experienced that problem yourself by not getting </p>the domain name you were looking for. German (.de) domains </p>recently sold their first million.</p></p><p><p>So to preserve rights, product names, and other </p>trademarks, try to get your name in the market you are </p>interested in now, before you face later possible legal </p>fights and bad reputation among the web community. The best </p>to preserve your rights is to register those domain names </p>before you have trouble with your competition doing the </p>registration instead of you. Domain names are gold in the </p>new economy. Be sure to save your place on the Internet frontier.</p></p><p><p>For those of you longer on the Internet, you might </p>remember the times when domain names were strictly given </p>only to the ones that they belong to, according to </p>some domain rules and guidelines.</p></p><p><p>Since that time we have seen a massive change on the Internet </p>and also in domain policies. Not only have lots of new </p>registrars come into the game, but also some new top level domains </p>have been added, and many loosened their policies in order </p>to fulfill the new needs.</p></p><p><p>It is interesting to note that there are many different </p>rules out there. Some restrict their services only to local </p>proven companies or departments while others sell to anyone </p>willing to pay the cash for it. We have been looking at the </p>European market first, but I recommend you also look for </p>available domain names from other countries, .cc for Coco Island </p>for example, or others with a nice ending.</p></p><p><p><b>Good luck!</b></p>
