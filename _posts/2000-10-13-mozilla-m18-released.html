You can <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/" title="Opens in new window" target="_foo">get it at the mozilla site</a>.                                                                  </p><p>Although there is no mention whether this is the expected beta release, this is to be the last M numbered milestone. According to the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap.html" title="Opens in new window" target="_foo">roadmap</a>, the new plan is to move from M numbers to version numbers, starting with mozilla0.6 later this year, and mozilla1.0 roughly due Q2 2001.
