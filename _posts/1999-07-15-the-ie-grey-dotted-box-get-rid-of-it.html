Ah, Internet Explorer. So far, the most reliable browser to use (far from anything perfect though), yet the Microsoft staff just has to throw in their own quirks, like the little grey dotted box that appears around all links. Gets annoying after a while and can ruin designs. So, get rid of it: <P></p>&lt;body onclick="self.focus();"&gt; <P></p>Done. However, the grey box will appear now briefly for less than a second and than go away, which is a lot better than before. <P></p>NOTE: THIS CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH FORMS AND OTHER THINGS WHERE A USER HAS TO TYPE SOMETHING IN. USE THIS FOR LINK ONLY PAGES. <P>
