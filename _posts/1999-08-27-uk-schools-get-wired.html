The government has made a <a href='http://www.dfee.gov.uk/grid/consult/index.htm' title='Government consultation paper'>commitment</a> that all schools, colleges, universities and libraries, should be online by 2002, and these figures suggest that they may actually meet this target.</p><p>So, good news for anyone wanting to work in education here, but remembering the pay scales, maybe not.</p><p>More news at the <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/education/newsid_431000/431517.stm' title='Good old BBC'>BBC</a>.
