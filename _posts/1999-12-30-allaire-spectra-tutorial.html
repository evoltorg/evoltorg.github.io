<p>Mastered ColdFusion? Need to manage a content-heavy site? You've heard of Allaire's &Uuml;bertool, <a href='/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=448'>Spectra</a> - it's a CF-based app which makes content management a snap. But, it's a bit more work to develop for. The Allaire site has next to no documentation (other than info about the very, very expensive <a href='/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=560'>training course</a>). So how do you learn?</p></p><p><p>Well a nice chap by the name of Scott rides to the rescue. He's putting together a <a href='http://www.figital.com/spectra/19991220/' title='Hello Spectra!' target='_blank'>step-by-step guide to putting together a Spectra application</a>. As the jazz tv presenter would have said, &quot;Nice!&quot;</p>
