As if looking for UFOs and cracking the toughest of cryptology keys wasn't enough, another group of scientists want to get in on the action.</p><p>Following the runaway success of SETI@Home's search of the skies, the UK's Rutherford Lab is jumping on the distributed computing bandwagon to predict global warming. <P>\nLike <a href='http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/' target='_new'>SETI@Home</a>, <a href='http://www.climate-dynamics.rl.ac.uk/~hansen/casino21.html' target='_new'>Casino 21</a> uses a screensaver to harness users' computers' downtime to analyse and model centrally captured data. <P>\nGiven SETI@Home's <a href='http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/stats/totals.html' target='_new'>1.3m users and 95k years of computer time</a>, RL are hoping for some pretty heavyweight support. Dunno - it doesn't seem as sexy to me... <P>\n<a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_473000/473856.stm' target='_new'>Here</a>'s the BBC story on the RL lab initiative. <P>\nEvolt.org's own <a href='http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cgi?cmd=team_lookup&name=evolt.org' target='_new'>SETI team</a> is doing just peachy by the way, with over a thousand work units processed in nearly 4 years of computer time. We haven't found anything definite yet, but some people have had some interesting spikes. If you're already doing SETI, you're very welcome to <a href='http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cgi?cmd=team_join_form&id=11406' target="_new">join the team</a>. <P>\n <P>
