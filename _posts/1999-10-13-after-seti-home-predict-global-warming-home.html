Starting with the communication ends that online media support, he moved back through design, HTML and server-side code. Then he got into running the whole show.
These days he\'s working for <a href=\"http://www-5.ibm.com/services/uk/services/bcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these people</a> as a Project Manager, and still thinks (nearly 6 years on) it\'s a hell of a lot better than working for a dot-com. In his Copious Free Time&trade;, he helps out running a <a href=\"http://www.purpur.co.uk/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloth Nappies</a> online store.

He\'s starting to (re)gain a sneaking regard for ECMAscript since the arrival of unobtrusive scripting.</p> 

<p>He\'s been a member of evolt.org since the very early days, a board member, a president, a writer and even contributed a modest amount of template code for the current site. Above all, he likes evolt.org to do things because it knowingly chooses to do so, rather than randomly stumbling into them. He\'s also one of the boys and girls who beervolts in the UK, although the arrival of small children in his life have knocked the frequency for 6.</p>

As if looking for UFOs and cracking the toughest of cryptology keys wasn't enough, another group of scientists want to get in on the action.</p><p>Following the runaway success of SETI@Home's search of the skies, the UK's Rutherford Lab is jumping on the distributed computing bandwagon to predict global warming. <P></p>Like <a href='http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/' target='_new'>SETI@Home</a>, <a href='http://www.climate-dynamics.rl.ac.uk/~hansen/casino21.html' target='_new'>Casino 21</a> uses a screensaver to harness users' computers' downtime to analyse and model centrally captured data. <P></p>Given SETI@Home's <a href='http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/stats/totals.html' target='_new'>1.3m users and 95k years of computer time</a>, RL are hoping for some pretty heavyweight support. Dunno - it doesn't seem as sexy to me... <P></p><a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/low/english/sci/tech/newsid_473000/473856.stm' target='_new'>Here</a>'s the BBC story on the RL lab initiative. <P></p>Evolt.org's own <a href='http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cgi?cmd=team_lookup&name=evolt.org' target='_new'>SETI team</a> is doing just peachy by the way, with over a thousand work units processed in nearly 4 years of computer time. We haven't found anything definite yet, but some people have had some interesting spikes. If you're already doing SETI, you're very welcome to <a href='http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cgi?cmd=team_join_form&id=11406' target="_new">join the team</a>. <P></p> <P>
