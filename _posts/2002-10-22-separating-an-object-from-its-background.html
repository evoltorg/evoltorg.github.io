<p>I've seen people try to separate an image from its background by using the \nPencil tool, by playing with the Magic Wand, and even\nby trying to draw an outline with the Lasso tool.</p></p><p><p>The main difficulty with trying to separate an image from its background \nis that there are pixels which cover an area of the\npicture which is partly foreground and partly background. With any of the \naforementioned methods, you have to declare whether a pixel is either \nforeground or background, even though it may be both.</p></p><p><p>Believe it or not, there is a way that you can cut pixels in half. In \nPhotoshop, the way it works is that if you cut a pixel in\nhalf, you'll have the same pixel, but it will be 50% transparent, so it \nwill be affected by what colour you put under it, just like the difference \nbetween coloured paper and cellophane.</p></p><p><p><img border="2" src="/evolt/images/43913/separation1.jpg" \n width="400" height="267"></p></p><p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the Freeform Pen tool \n(click and hold down on the fountain pen-shaped tool.)</p></p><p><p><img border="2" src="/evolt/images/43913/separation2.jpg" \n width="400" height="267"></p></p><p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Draw a rough outline around the object. Generally \nerr on the side of cutting into the image rather than leaving a\ngap.</p></p><p><p>Use Ctrl+Click to manipulate the points, and drag their &quot;arms&quot; \naround to change the curve. To insert a new point, just\nclick on the line.</p></p><p><p>When you've finished, right-click the line, and click Make Selection. \nThis turns your line into a selection.</p></p><p><p><img border="2" src="/evolt/images/43913/separation3.jpg" \n width="400" height="267"></p></p><p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Cut out your object and paste it into a new \nlayer. You can then replace your background layer with whatever you\nwant.</p></p><p><p>I've put in this magenta (opposite of green) background to show up any \ngreen bits that might still be stuck to our budgie.</p></p><p><p>Notice there are no jaggy edges, and there is no visible green outline.</p>
