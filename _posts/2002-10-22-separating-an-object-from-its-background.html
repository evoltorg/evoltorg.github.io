excerpt: "Put that Magic Wand away! This tutorial shows how to separate an image from its background by using Adobe Photoshop's Freeform Pen tool."

<p>I've seen people try to separate an image from its background by using the </p>Pencil tool, by playing with the Magic Wand, and even</p>by trying to draw an outline with the Lasso tool.</p></p><p><p>The main difficulty with trying to separate an image from its background </p>is that there are pixels which cover an area of the</p>picture which is partly foreground and partly background. With any of the </p>aforementioned methods, you have to declare whether a pixel is either </p>foreground or background, even though it may be both.</p></p><p><p>Believe it or not, there is a way that you can cut pixels in half. In </p>Photoshop, the way it works is that if you cut a pixel in</p>half, you'll have the same pixel, but it will be 50% transparent, so it </p>will be affected by what colour you put under it, just like the difference </p>between coloured paper and cellophane.</p></p><p><p><img border="2" src="/evolt/images/43913/separation1.jpg" </p> width="400" height="267"></p></p><p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the Freeform Pen tool </p>(click and hold down on the fountain pen-shaped tool.)</p></p><p><p><img border="2" src="/evolt/images/43913/separation2.jpg" </p> width="400" height="267"></p></p><p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Draw a rough outline around the object. Generally </p>err on the side of cutting into the image rather than leaving a</p>gap.</p></p><p><p>Use Ctrl+Click to manipulate the points, and drag their &quot;arms&quot; </p>around to change the curve. To insert a new point, just</p>click on the line.</p></p><p><p>When you've finished, right-click the line, and click Make Selection. </p>This turns your line into a selection.</p></p><p><p><img border="2" src="/evolt/images/43913/separation3.jpg" </p> width="400" height="267"></p></p><p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Cut out your object and paste it into a new </p>layer. You can then replace your background layer with whatever you</p>want.</p></p><p><p>I've put in this magenta (opposite of green) background to show up any </p>green bits that might still be stuck to our budgie.</p></p><p><p>Notice there are no jaggy edges, and there is no visible green outline.</p>
