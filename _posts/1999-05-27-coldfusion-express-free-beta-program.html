The good folks at Allaire have opened a beta test to all HomeSite customers for the new free version of ColdFusion Server, called <a href="http://beta.allaire.com/betasite/registration/index.cfm?betaprogram=cfexpress" target="_new">ColdFusion Express</a>. It's basically a limited-functionality version of the full-blown server. Sure, it's free, but you gotta be a HomeSite customer.
