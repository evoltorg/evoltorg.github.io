<p>IBM has released a version of Netscape 4.61 with BiDi support,</p>enabling it to display Hebrew and Arabic web pages natively.</p>                                                                        </p>This gives site developers cheaper and more advanced ways of creating sites in these languages.</p></p><p><blockquote> </p>  <p><i>Note- Since I work mainly with Hebrew web sites in the Hebrew market, </p>    this article will focus on the Hebrew side of things. In Arabic, matters are </p>    similar but not identical, with some additional problems unique to the Arabic </p>    language. I will love to hear comments from people who create Arabic language </p>    web sites.</i><br></p>    S.L.F </p></p></blockquote></p><p><h4>What's so tough about Hebrew and Arabic?</h4></p><p><p>Hebrew and Arabic are Bi-Directional languages (BiDi for short). This means that </p>while most of the text is written from right-to-left, some of the text (like </p>numbers) is written from left to right.</p></p><p><p>Historically, since Netscape lacked any kind of</p>Hebrew support, a cloggy workaround was developed</p>which is called "Visual Hebrew".  In general, this had</p>two parts:</p></p><p><p><b>On the Client side</b>, the user needed to</p>install a "Web View" font, which has a Western</p>encoding but includes Hebrew glyphs (and most of the</p>web view fonts are of very low quality).</p></p><p><p><b>On the Developer side</b>, the developer must</p>have used certain techniques to have the page</p>readable with the web view font:</p></p><p><ol start=1 type=1></p>  <li>All Hebrew text must be reversed, while leaving</p>    any numbers or English text intact. For example,</p>    the sentence:<br></p>    <i>"I love Lucy and will meet with her on May 13"</i><br></p>    Would become<br></p>    <i>"13 yaM no reh htiw teem lliw dna ycuL evol I"</i></li></p>  <li>All line breaks must be hard coded into the HTML</p>    - you can not let the browser wrap long lines, since</p>    then the words will become out of order.</li></p>  <li>All text must be manually aligned to the right -</p>    either with &lt;p align="right"&gt; or with</p>    tables.</li></p>  <li>You cannot use lists (&lt;ol&gt; or &lt;ul&gt;),</p>    since they would be indented to the left instead</p>    of to the right.</li></p>  <li>You cannot define font faces (either via CSS or</p>    via the &lt;font&gt; tag), since the Hebrew fonts</p>    on the system are logical fonts, and would not</p>    work with web pages.</li></p>  <li>Some elements, like forms and page titles, the</p>    browser uses the OS directly to display, which</p>    means that they have to be written differently</p>    since the OS uses logical Hebrew (in logical</p>    Hebrew, the data is stored in the order it was</p>    entered, with a flag marking the directionality.</p>    When the data is processed and displayed the OS</p>    uses that flag to keep the correct direction of</p>    the element)</li></p></ol></p><p><p>It is rather obvious that this visual method has</p>  huge shortcomings, both on the user side (you can</p>  not copy and paste directly from web pages, and the</p>  browser search function is useless) and on the</p>  developer side (the extra cost of converting</p>  existing documents to the visual encoding, the</p>  limitations of design, and a need to add an extra</p>  Hebrew flipping function to any data that is going</p>  in or out of a database or being accepted from the</p>  user).</p></p><p><h4>Support by the browsers</h4></p><p><p>Microsoft, with version 3 of Internet Explorer,</p>  introduced a separate "Hebrew Enabled" version</p>  which uses the Unicode BiDi algorithm on Hebrew</p>  operating systems in order to display visually</p>  encoded web pages with any system font, and new</p>  support for "Logical" web pages, which work similar</p>  to the OS in allowing the Arthur's "flag" the</p>  directionality of elements, and render both</p>  Right-To-Left (RTL) and Left-To-Right (LTR)</p>  elements properly.</p></p><p><p>In version 5 of Internet Explorer, Microsoft went</p>  one step further, allowing anyone, on any language</p>  of Windows to view Hebrew web pages - both logical</p>  and visual encoded (unfortunately, Mac IE5 has no</p>  Hebrew support). However, to be able to write in</p>  Hebrew (for example in web forms) the user still</p>  needs to have a Hebrew supporting OS (such as</p>  Windows 2000 with the Hebrew language pack</p>  installed).</p></p><p><p>The W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/dirlang.html">HTML 4 </p>  spec</a> also included the Unicode BiDi algorithm,</p>  introducing among others the DIR (direction)</p>  attribute that can go with any element to mark</p>  its directionality (RTL or LTR) and the &amp;lrm;</p>  (Left to Right Mark) and &amp;rlm; (Right to Left</p>  Mark) entities, which control the directionality</p>  of single characters.</p></p><p><p>All this time, the Netscape browser continued to</p>  <a href="http://www.nirdagan.com/hebrew/review">lack </p>  any BiDi support</a> whatsoever.</p></p><p><p>This caused an interesting chicken-and-egg</p>  problem since, while about 80% of the users were</p>  using IE, web sites did not want to lose 20% of</p>  their users, so continued to use visual Hebrew</p>  encoding for their pages (Even the</p>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/israel">Microsoft </p>  Israel</a> web site continued to use visual Hebrew</p>  for a surprisingly long time). Of course, the fact</p>  that most web pages where written visually and</p>  therefore viewable with Netscape, did not give end</p>  users any real reason to cry out for BiDi support</p>  in their browser. The problem of copying and</p>  pasting to and from web pages was solved by a</p>  booming market of utilities and applications that</p>  did just that.</p></p><p><p>Until last week.</p></p><p><p>Last week <a href="http://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/netscape3/bidi-p">IBM released</a> </p>  a version of Netscape 4.61 which they had licensed</p>  from Netscape and added BiDi support.</p></p><p><p>The IBM version, Netscape 4.61i, includes the full</p>  Communicator suite, but just the browser has BiDi</p>  support (unlike IE where the full package - the</p>  browser, FrontPage Express and Outlook Express</p>  support Hebrew).</p></p><p><p>The user interface has no Hebrew option (again,</p>  unlike IE which has a Hebrew interface available</p>  for users of localized Hebrew windows), but is</p>  finally aware of BiDi.</p></p><p><p>No more need to define a special web view font in</p>  order to view Hebrew web pages - any Hebrew font</p>  installed on the system will do.</p></p><p><p>The fonts for Hebrew <a href="http://www.xslf.com/axs/ax.cgi?http://www.forbes.co.il/nana/img/bidi_fonts.gif">are </p>  defined</a> independently from fonts for other</p>  languages. The user can, for example, define</p>  Trebuchet MS (which has no Hebrew glyphs) as</p>  his/her default Latin1 font, and Arial Hebrew as</p>  his/her default Hebrew font.</p></p><p><p>There is a <a href="http://www.xslf.com/axs/ax.cgi?http://www.forbes.co.il/nana/img/hb_ns.gif">full new section</a></p>  in the preferences in order to define BiDi options</p>  like the default direction of a web page</p>  (LTR or RTL), the default user encoding etc.</p></p><p><p>Sites that have no encoding defined or have</p>  incorrect encoding defined, can be viewed by</p>  switching to the correct character set from the</p>  <a href="http://www.xslf.com/axs/ax.cgi?http://www.forbes.co.il/nana/img/ns_heb.gif">new </p>  encoding menu</a>. This time, it has all four</p>  Hebrew character sets:</p></p><p><ol start=1 type=1></p>  <li>Hebrew logical (windows-1255)</li></p>  <li>Hebrew implicit (ISO-8859-8I, similar but not identical to the one above)</li></p>  <li>Hebrew visual </li></p>  <li>Hebrew DOS (which is almost not in use)</li></p></ol></p><p><p>Yes, logical Hebrew is finally here in Netscape.</p>  It still suffers some bugs, but it works well with</p>  most of my test pages.</p></p><p><p>I should note though, that the MSN Israel web</p>  site (<a href="http://www.msn.co.il/homepage.asp">http://www.msn.co.il/homepage.asp</a>) </p>  the only major web site written in logical Hebrew,</p>  caused Hebrew Netscape to crash consistently. Is it</p>  the web site? Is it something in logical Hebrew?</p>  Is it the browser? At the moment I haven't done</p>  enough testing yet to determined what it is.</p></p><p><p>One issue I did find, though, is that the User</p>  Agent string of this browser is identical to any</p>  Netscape 4.6 international browser, therefore</p>  there is no way to tell from standard server logs</p>  how many of the Netscape visitors to a site</p>  actually have Hebrew support.</p></p><p><p>IBM apparently will be basing their work on</p>  <a href="http://www.langbox.com/AraMosaic/mozilla/index.html">Hebrew </p>  support in the Mozilla project</a> upon the work</p>  they have done here, but AOL/Netscape has of yet</p>  not said a word about their plans, if any, of</p>  including the BiDi support code in the upcoming</p>  Netscape 6.</p></p><p><h4>For more information:</h4></p><ul></p>  <li><a href="http://www6.software.ibm.com/dl/netscape3/bidi-p">The URL to download </p>    Netscape with BiDi support</a> </li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.qsm.co.il/Hebrew/hebrew.htm">Jonathan (Jony) Rosenne's </p>    Hebrew Page</a></li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.nirdagan.com/hebrew/">Hebrew on the web</a></li></p></ul>
