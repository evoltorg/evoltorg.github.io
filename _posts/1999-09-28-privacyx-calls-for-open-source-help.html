Embattled Canadian software startup, <a href="http://www.privacyx.com/">PrivacyX</a>, is </p>asking for support from open source volunteers to secure its applications which hope to </p>offer secure and private email, web surfing and chatting.</p><p>In late August, cryptographer Ian Goldberg posted a page - <a </p>href="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/noprivacyx.html">About to lose your PrivacyX</a>  </p>- which showed the allegedly secure browser as being, well, not all that secure. </p>PrivacyX's attempted cheap fix (as outlined in the September 2 update to Goldberg's </p>page), was discovered by Goldberg, and it seems PrivacyX have decided that an open </p>source path might work for the software.</p><p>Douglas Whorrall, President of PrivacyX.Com Solutions, Inc, notes that "It invariably </p>happens when software is released for public consumption that some problem with the code </p>arises or an insecurity is found."</p><p>He believes that the "best way to build a product that has the best interest of users at </p>heart and the highest quality of security and performance" is to get potential users </p>involved with development. Any developers interested in the product, or privacy issues </p>may wish to visit PrivacyX's <a href="http://www.browser.privacyx.com">Open Source </p>Anonymous Browsing Project</a>.</p><p></p>For more information, read PrivacyX's <a </p>href="https://www.privacyx.com/company/09271999a.html">press release</a> or <a </p>href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/slashdot/technology/story/21982.html">Wired's view </p>of it all</a>.
