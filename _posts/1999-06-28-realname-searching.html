<A HREF="http://www.centraal.com/">Centraal</A> has signed a deal with Microsoft in order to get its RealNames service integrated with the Microsoft Network and as a default search in Internet Explorer.  As well, a deal with AOL is in the works which may also see RealNames incorporated into AOL's Communicator web browser. <P></p>RealNames is a database of plain-language terms that map to web sites.  Web users will no longer have to remember long URLs or obscure sequences of mouse clicks in order to get the information that they are looking for. <P></p>Check out CNET's <A HREF="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,84-38473,00.html?tt.yfin..txt.ni">story</A> for details.  <P>
