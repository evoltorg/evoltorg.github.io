<p>No sooner do I <a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Say_Goodbye_to_Free_Email/1/22939/index.html#comments">sing the praises</a> of owning a Yahoo! account and I'm forced to recant.</p></p><p><p>According to this <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/731517.asp?cp1=1" target="_blank" title="article on MSNBC (link opens in a new window)">MSNBC article</a>, Yahoo! changed its privacy policy this week which also created a new marketing preferences page which contains a laundry list of categories, all defaulted to "Yes, please deluge my inbox with offers for crap that I don't want or need."</p></p><p><p>There's also a special option for "Please harass me by phone" and "Please kill more trees and deliver things to my mailbox at home."</p></p><p><p>To "opt out," login to your Yahoo! account and go to options > account information. Look for the link "edit your marketing preferences" in your member information. You can also try to jump directly to your preferences page at <a href="http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile" target="_blank" title="Yahoo preferences page (link opens in a new window)"> http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/eval_profile</a></p></p><p><p>I think it may be time to forcibly remove Yahoo!'s exclamation point privileges.</p>
