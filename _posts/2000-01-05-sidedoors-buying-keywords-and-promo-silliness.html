I'm sure you know your site promotion basics, here I'll\ntalk about a few things many sitebuilders don't\nconsider. I'll review the basics of\npromotion at the bottom of the article.</p><p><p></p><p>I learned a lot while doing research for a site that's geared\ntowards people wanting to learn English, so I'll use that\nas an example here.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Exchanging links</h3>\nAfter searching the search\nengines for your target keywords and finding sites that\ncan link to you this way, try this: find out who links to\nyour competitors or similar sites (you can do this in\nmany search engines, like AltaVista, with\n"link:http://competitor.com"),\nthen put up a link to those pages, and only then ask\nthem all for a link back. Obviously, to get links you'll\nneed content (usually anyway).</p><p><p></p><p>Depending on the kind of site you have, exchanging links should account\nfor at\nleast 50% of your promotion efforts.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Finding good keyphrases</h3>\nGoto.com has \n<a href="http://inventory.go2.com/inventory/Search_Suggestion.jhtml">a \ncool service</a>: you can see how often certain keywords are\nused. And it also suggests related keywords.\n<a href="http://selfpromotion.com/?CF=peter@poorbuthappy.com">Selfpromotion.com</a> has a cool service (if you join them)\nthat'll automate this process.</p><p><p></p><p>With my English learning site, this gave me a surprise. It\nturned out I needed to target the keywords "prepare\ntoefl" (which stands for Test Of Eenglish as a Foreign Language")\nand "English grammar game" more, instead of just\n"learning English", which got only a few hits, but\nbasically is the same as "preparing toefl".</p><p><p></p><p>So there you go, a bit of research can definitely be worth it.\nIt may even show you that you shouldn't focus too much on \nsearchengines for your\nparticular site.</p><p><p></p><p>There's another trick that some people may consider a\nbit dirty (but hey, in love and on the net...): target the\nbrand names of the competition (I'm NOT talking hijacking domain\nnames).\nSo when people look\ndirectly for the competition, they'll have an option to go\nto you as well.\nFor example: write a review about your products \ncompared to your competitors' \nproducts. Give it a good title, like "New article: comparison between\nxxx\nand yyy". Many people will go to a "review of xxx" site\nbefore they go to the site themselves.</p><p><p></p><p>And: if at all possible for the indexes (like YAHOO), get a\nsite title that starts with an A or a number. They list the\nresults alphabetically.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Where to put keyphrases</h3>\nApart from putting your\nkeyphrases in your metatags and body, don't forget to\nput them in your title! All your important keywords\nshould be in your page title!\nSome people advise putting keywords in your URL as well. This doesn't\nwork.\nThe searchengines just treat the keyword as a keyword in the body of the\ntext.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>More promotion</h3>\nGoto.com again. Yes, they're a\nsmall searchengine, but they can help you a great deal.\nThey offer you to buy keywords (for as little as .01$).\nSo if someone searches for that keyword, you get on\npage 1, and only pay for clickthroughs. This is very\ncheap traffic, and if you use focused keywords (instead\nof general ones), quality traffic as well.\n<a href="http://selfpromotion.com/?CF=peter@poorbuthappy.com">Selfpromotion.com</a> (sorry to keep mentioning them) has\nsome very good articles and tools for this by the way.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Sidedoors</h3>\nSidedoors are pieces of content that are\nrelated to your site. So for our English site I could write\nan article comparing online English learning services,\nhighlighting our site which obviously is the best. Imagine\nsomeone searching for a service like this seeing this\ncomparative article in their searchengine page. Do you\nthink they'll go for it?</p><p><p></p><p>Sidedoors can be anything that's useful to people who\nare in your target audience, it doesn't have to deal\ndirectly with your site.</p><p><p></p><p>Many promotion people will tell you to build 100s of sidedoors that target\ncertain keywords that all link to your main site. They mean sidedoors\nwithut\nuseful content. This is spamming, and will get you banned from the\nsearchengines.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Your front window</h3>\nTraditional stores dress up\ntheir front window, because they know it's what gets\npassers by interested in their shop. Your front window\nis NOT your homepage. It's your title+description\nmeta+the first lines of your page+your URL. But mainly\nyour title. That's what people see in the searchengines.\nThat's where they decide to enter or not. Think about it.\nCraft your title carefully.</p><p><p></p><p>Finally, I promised I would, so here they are:</p><p><h3>The basics</h3></p><p><ol>\n<li>Search engines are not the Only Way. For\nmost sites, it seems more traffic comes from well\nexchanged links than from search engines. So make\nsure to spend some time exchanging links.\n<p>\n<li>Keyphrases are more important than keywords. So\n'webdesign Vermont' will get you better traffic than\n'webdesign', since that one has thousands if not millions\nof competitors going for it.\n<p>\n<li>Metatags: use your keyword and description metatag\nwisely, and don't abuse!\n<p>\n<li>Content rules the waves!\nAnd will more so in the\nfuture. Get yourself some writers (real ones). Get\nyourself an editor. It'll be one of the best investments\non the site you can make, (apart from that automatic\nburrito heating machine you've been dying to get your\nhands on).\nJacob Nielsen recently released a new book that basically says: focus on\nquality content.\nI couldn't agree more.\nIt's often better to do rewrites of your content than redesign your\nwebsite.</p><p></ol>
