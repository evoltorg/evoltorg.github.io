I'm sure you know your site promotion basics, here I'll</p>talk about a few things many sitebuilders don't</p>consider. I'll review the basics of</p>promotion at the bottom of the article.</p><p><p></p><p>I learned a lot while doing research for a site that's geared</p>towards people wanting to learn English, so I'll use that</p>as an example here.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Exchanging links</h3></p>After searching the search</p>engines for your target keywords and finding sites that</p>can link to you this way, try this: find out who links to</p>your competitors or similar sites (you can do this in</p>many search engines, like AltaVista, with</p>"link:http://competitor.com"),</p>then put up a link to those pages, and only then ask</p>them all for a link back. Obviously, to get links you'll</p>need content (usually anyway).</p><p><p></p><p>Depending on the kind of site you have, exchanging links should account</p>for at</p>least 50% of your promotion efforts.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Finding good keyphrases</h3></p>Goto.com has </p><a href="http://inventory.go2.com/inventory/Search_Suggestion.jhtml">a </p>cool service</a>: you can see how often certain keywords are</p>used. And it also suggests related keywords.</p><a href="http://selfpromotion.com/?CF=peter@poorbuthappy.com">Selfpromotion.com</a> has a cool service (if you join them)</p>that'll automate this process.</p><p><p></p><p>With my English learning site, this gave me a surprise. It</p>turned out I needed to target the keywords "prepare</p>toefl" (which stands for Test Of Eenglish as a Foreign Language")</p>and "English grammar game" more, instead of just</p>"learning English", which got only a few hits, but</p>basically is the same as "preparing toefl".</p><p><p></p><p>So there you go, a bit of research can definitely be worth it.</p>It may even show you that you shouldn't focus too much on </p>searchengines for your</p>particular site.</p><p><p></p><p>There's another trick that some people may consider a</p>bit dirty (but hey, in love and on the net...): target the</p>brand names of the competition (I'm NOT talking hijacking domain</p>names).</p>So when people look</p>directly for the competition, they'll have an option to go</p>to you as well.</p>For example: write a review about your products </p>compared to your competitors' </p>products. Give it a good title, like "New article: comparison between</p>xxx</p>and yyy". Many people will go to a "review of xxx" site</p>before they go to the site themselves.</p><p><p></p><p>And: if at all possible for the indexes (like YAHOO), get a</p>site title that starts with an A or a number. They list the</p>results alphabetically.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Where to put keyphrases</h3></p>Apart from putting your</p>keyphrases in your metatags and body, don't forget to</p>put them in your title! All your important keywords</p>should be in your page title!</p>Some people advise putting keywords in your URL as well. This doesn't</p>work.</p>The searchengines just treat the keyword as a keyword in the body of the</p>text.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>More promotion</h3></p>Goto.com again. Yes, they're a</p>small searchengine, but they can help you a great deal.</p>They offer you to buy keywords (for as little as .01$).</p>So if someone searches for that keyword, you get on</p>page 1, and only pay for clickthroughs. This is very</p>cheap traffic, and if you use focused keywords (instead</p>of general ones), quality traffic as well.</p><a href="http://selfpromotion.com/?CF=peter@poorbuthappy.com">Selfpromotion.com</a> (sorry to keep mentioning them) has</p>some very good articles and tools for this by the way.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Sidedoors</h3></p>Sidedoors are pieces of content that are</p>related to your site. So for our English site I could write</p>an article comparing online English learning services,</p>highlighting our site which obviously is the best. Imagine</p>someone searching for a service like this seeing this</p>comparative article in their searchengine page. Do you</p>think they'll go for it?</p><p><p></p><p>Sidedoors can be anything that's useful to people who</p>are in your target audience, it doesn't have to deal</p>directly with your site.</p><p><p></p><p>Many promotion people will tell you to build 100s of sidedoors that target</p>certain keywords that all link to your main site. They mean sidedoors</p>withut</p>useful content. This is spamming, and will get you banned from the</p>searchengines.</p><p><p></p><p><h3>Your front window</h3></p>Traditional stores dress up</p>their front window, because they know it's what gets</p>passers by interested in their shop. Your front window</p>is NOT your homepage. It's your title+description</p>meta+the first lines of your page+your URL. But mainly</p>your title. That's what people see in the searchengines.</p>That's where they decide to enter or not. Think about it.</p>Craft your title carefully.</p><p><p></p><p>Finally, I promised I would, so here they are:</p><p><h3>The basics</h3></p><p><ol></p><li>Search engines are not the Only Way. For</p>most sites, it seems more traffic comes from well</p>exchanged links than from search engines. So make</p>sure to spend some time exchanging links.</p><p></p><li>Keyphrases are more important than keywords. So</p>'webdesign Vermont' will get you better traffic than</p>'webdesign', since that one has thousands if not millions</p>of competitors going for it.</p><p></p><li>Metatags: use your keyword and description metatag</p>wisely, and don't abuse!</p><p></p><li>Content rules the waves!</p>And will more so in the</p>future. Get yourself some writers (real ones). Get</p>yourself an editor. It'll be one of the best investments</p>on the site you can make, (apart from that automatic</p>burrito heating machine you've been dying to get your</p>hands on).</p>Jacob Nielsen recently released a new book that basically says: focus on</p>quality content.</p>I couldn't agree more.</p>It's often better to do rewrites of your content than redesign your</p>website.</p><p></ol>
