excerpt: "What do you mean by Profit? How much do your projects make? How do you price jobs so that you make enough?"
---
<p></p>	When you're selling things &ndash; no matter whether it's <a href="http://links.purpur.co.uk/link.php?id=100">products</a></p>	or <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/services/uk/bcs/html/other/index_low.html">services</a> &ndash;</p>	you want to be selling at a profit. You want to make money at it &mdash; that's</p>	the point of the game.</p></p></p><p></p>	But what is <q>profit</q>? I've had many conversations with colleagues,</p>	clients and friends along the lines of:</p></p></p><blockquote></p>	So, you're selling this widget. It costs you &pound;15 and you're selling it</p>	for &pound;20. That's <strong>&pound;5 pure profit</strong>.</p></blockquote></p><p></p>	Which usually means</p></p>	</p><blockquote></p>	You're trousering the fiver, so you can move a bit on your selling </p>	price/commission rate.</p></blockquote></p><p></p>	Something very similar applies to project costings. The same clients, employees,</p>	colleagues and friends tend to think that you subtract the cost of things</p>	bought for the project (say software licensing, hosting and so on), and</p>	the rest is <q>pure profit.</q></p></p></p><p></p>	But is that so? What does profit mean, and how do we make sure we're making</p>	any (let alone enough)? Let's take a look.</p></p></p><h2>What is Profit</h2></p><p></p>	Profit is simply the final amount of money that the business makes, once <em>all</em></p>	the costs are paid from income (aka Revenue). But Revenue and Cost have to go a</p>	long, long way before what's left makes its way into your trousers.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	What you're more interested in at a project level is <strong>Gross Profit</strong>.</p>	That's Revenue, less all the things you had to do to earn it. On a software/development</p>	project, the largest item is likely to be Labour &mdash; the amount the business</p>	or subcontractors charges the project for use of people. But it'll also include:</p><p></p></p><ul></p>	<li>any software you license for the project/client's use</li></p>	<li>any hardware you buy for the project/client's use</li></p>	<li>any custom development the project requires</li></p>	<li>any hosting/connectivity the project requires</li></p>	<li>all costs associated with enabling the people to work on the project,</p>	so all travel/accommodation expenses for the project. Be careful about</p>	which expenses are allocated to your project, and don't get confused that</p>	the term Expenses is also somewhat interchangeable with Indirect Costs</p>	(see below).</li></p></ul></p><p></p>	Generally, the most controllable element is going to be Labour. The other</p>	elements are either pre-agreed with the client or already contractually locked at the</p>	start of the project.</p></p></p><p></p>	What you <em>can</em> do though is swap people about, swapping more expensive</p>	people for less expensive if you're over-budget, rolling people on or</p>	off if you're behind or ahead of schedule and so on. You can also drive the</p>	team's sense of urgency to improve time and/or cost efficiency.</p></p></p><h3>Measuring Project Success</h3></p><p></p>	In many organisations, a <abbr title="Project Manager">PM</abbr>'s primary target is hitting the required level of</p>	<acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, and often, this is fixed on a company or client level as a percentage</p>	of Revenue. Hit (or exceed) the desired <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, and you're a hero. Miss the</p>	target, even if you deliver some <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, and you're not.</p></p></p><p><h2>Beware - Fixed Costs Lurking</h2></p><p><p>But I hear you say</p></p><blockquote></p>	What's the problem? I delivered 25% <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>. I know my target was 30% <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, but I</p>	still brought in Profit, right? So I still did well.</p></blockquote></p><p></p>	Well, not necessarily. Why do you think the target was set at 30%? Was it</p>	just corporate avarice and a desire to stick it to the customer? Possible,</p>	but unlikely.</p></p></p><p></p>	The reason for what might seem high targets is that the project's <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> has to</p>	pay for a whole load of other costs, which are incurred no matter what the</p>	size of the job, or whether you even do it at all.</p></p></p><h3></p>	Quick Costs Quiz</p></h3></p><p></p>	Who pays for the following:</p></p></p><ol></p>	<li>Time spent selling</li></p>	<li>Your company's offices (premises, heating, phone, equipment)</li></p>	<li>Your site hosting</li></p>	<li>Staff salaries that aren't client chargeable</li></p>	<li>Training</li></p>	<li>Interest on Bank Loans</li></p>	<li>Advertising</li></p>	<li>Travel that's not client chargeable</li></p>	<li>Staff Holiday Time</li></p>	<li>Taxes</li></p>	<li>Developing new products and services</li></p></ol></p><p></p>	Well, the business does. And it has to come from somewhere (sadly). So if</p>	it doesn't come from clients, where <em>does</em> it come from? </p>	Your project <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> has to contribute towards these costs, which</p>	mount up every day, no matter how much business you're doing. </p></p></p><p></p>	If you didn't spend them, sure, you'd have higher profits at the end. But</p>	you'd seriously dent your capability to operate as a going concern. They're</p>	fixed - there's very little you can do in the Project to affect them as you're</p>	spending them <em>indirectly</em>. These costs are Expenses to the business</p>	as a whole, rather than to your project and consist of everything the company</p>	has to spend to develop products and services and bring them to the market.</p>	They're called <strong>Fixed Costs aka Indirect Costs</strong>.</p></p></p><p></p>	Now you've paid Direct Costs (leaving you with <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>) and Indirect Costs, what</p>	you're left with is Pure Profit that the business owners can now trouser.</p>	Right? Ah, no.</p></p></p><h3>Death and..?</h3></p><p></p>	Yes, you guessed it, Taxes. What you're left with at this point is a Pre-Tax</p>	Income (<acronym>PTI</acronym>) aka Net Earnings Before Taxes </p>	(<acronym>NEBT</acronym>). <acronym>PTI</acronym> is like your company's</p>	salary. The <a href="http://www.stevesbeatles.com/songs/taxman.asp">Taxman</a> </p>	has to have his slice before it goes near <em>anyone's</em> trousers. Depending</p>	on where you work, this will a be combination of any number of national and local</p>	taxes (<acronym title="Nota Bene">NB</acronym> for UK people, this might not </p>	include <acronym title="Value Added Tax">VAT</acronym>, as depending on</p>	how your accountant wants to handle it, it may be considered a Direct Cost</p>	to the project).</p></p></p><p></p>	Once the business has paid tax on what's left of the Revenue you brought in,</p>	<em>then</em> &ndash; only then &ndash; can you look at the pittance that's</p>	left and call it <q>Profit</q>.</p></p></p><h2>Pricing for Profit</h2></p><p><p></p>	So that tidy nestegg of <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> that you </p>	delivered to the company gets chopped up many ways to pay the project and </p>	company's costs before it can be considered Profit.</p>	This might be visible to you, so at the end of the year or project, </p>	your (on-target, right?) <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> takes a </p>	big charge for Indirect Costs (this is called Accruals). Or it might be </p>	invisible - so you just deliver your GP to the company, and it all</p>	happens behind the scenes. Either way, you <em>are</em> contributing to</p>	those costs, so your initial pricing had better reflect those costs.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	At the start of this article, you may have thought something like <q>30%</p>	Pure Profit? That's extortionate!</q> Hopefully now, you'll see it as something</p>	more realistic. When you set your target <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym></p>	for a project, you need to have an understanding of all the Direct and Indirect</p>	Costs that the project will need to bear. Once you understand the true costs,</p>	you're in a much better place to set a realistic price that leave the company</p>	ahead of the game at the end.</p></p></p><p></p>	But I hear you say:</p></p></p><blockquote></p>	But <strong>my</strong> clients won't pay prices that include such a high </p>	<acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>.</p></blockquote></p><p></p>	Might I respectfully suggest that you're working with clients who either</p>	don't understand or (worse) don't care that you make enough to stay in</p>	business? Hopefully the above will give you ammunition for your negotiations.</p>	If you're doing small numbers of large projects, chances are that you're sharing the</p>	Indirect Costs around more thinly, reduce the proportion of non-chargeable</p>	staff time and take less management overhead than large numbers of small jobs. </p>	So it's reasonable that larger projects attract a lower percentage charge for</p>	Expenses, and therefore require lower <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym></p>	targets.</p></p></p><h2>Definitions</h2></p><p></p>	To recap all those definitions (and a few more you might hear):</p></p></p><dl></p>	<dt>Profit</dt></p>		<dd></p>			The final amount remaining after all costs have been paid from Revenue.</p>			Very difficult to calculate on a project by project basis, so a project</p>			usually talks about Gross Profit.</p>		</dd></p>	<dt>Revenue</dt></p>		<dd></p>			The money that you charge to customers for providing products or</p>			services.</p>		</dd></p>	<dt>Costs</dt></p>		<dd></p>			The total money it takes to deliver the product or service; not only</p>			the cost of producing the actual delivery, but also having an organisation</p>			in place to do it.</p>		</dd></p>	<dt>Direct (aka Variable) Costs</dt></p>		<dd></p>			The actual costs you can directly associate with each item or project.</p>			These vary with the level of activity &mdash; sell/produce/deliver </p>			more and your costs go up. You add a requirement? You add developer</p>			time, and that's a direct cost. Need hosting for a client site?</p>			That's a direct cost.</p>		</dd></p>	<dt>Gross Profit</dt></p>		<dd></p>			A project's <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> is what many</p>			people think of as profit - it's the project Revenue, less Direct</p>			Costs. This is frequently expressed as a percentage of Revenue.</p>		</dd></p>	<dt>Indirect (aka Fixed) Costs</dt></p>		<dd></p>			Costs you bear, whether you're delivering or not. Bank loans, admin</p>			staff, heating, lighting, marketing &amp; sales; they're all indirect</p>			costs.</p>		</dd></p>	<dt>Expenses</dt></p>		<dd></p>			An expense is what is spent to bring a product to market and sell it.</p>			This is an indirect cost, and shouldn't be confused with expenses that</p>			your team charge for travel, accommodation etc (these are <em>direct</em> project</p>			costs). The most common type of Expenses a Project Manager will have to</p>			bear are SG&amp;A expenses - Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.</p>		</dd></p>	<dt>Overhead</dt></p>		<dd></p>			Overhead is an expense that goes to maintain the organisation. This </p>			might be management and admin staff. It's also the cost of people </p>			who aren't directly billable, such as system quality assurance or </p>			the operational support staff. It's equipment purchase/lease and</p>			network connectivity. It's heating and lighting.</p>		</dd></p>	<dt>Burden</dt></p>		<dd></p>			Burden is those expenses associated with employees. This includes </p>			payroll taxes, benefits, and holiday. It also includes all the time</p>			that your staff are sitting around, not earning Revenue (which is</p>			why contractors are popular, although their rates will include an</p>			amount to cover <em>their</em> Burden).</p>		</dd> </p>	<dt>Year-end Accruals</dt></p>		<dd></p>			Projects are often charged their Expenses at the end of the year &ndash;</p>			they're all saved up (accrued) and dropped on the project in one go.</p>		</dd>	</p>	<dt>PTI (aka NEBT)</dt></p>		<dd></p>			Once you've taken all your Indirect costs away from your </p>			<acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, you're left with your</p>			Net Earnings Before Taxes (<acronym>NEBT</acronym>) aka Pre-Tax</p>			Income (<acronym>PTI</acronym>). Take off taxes from your company's</p>			total PTI and you have Profit - <em>Pure</em> Profit at last!</p>		</dd></p><p></dl></p><h2>Bootnote</h2></p><p></p>	All pricing, margin and Gross Profit figures above are fictitious and arbitrary, </p>	used simply to illustrate the points.</p>	</p></p></p>
