excerpt: "Not everyone has time to conduct a formal usability study, or the money to invest in a full blown usability initiative, and frankly, lots of times that might not be the best option anyway.  Sometimes a designer or developer needs that one-on-one, maker-to-user interface. Gorilla Usability ..."

<h2></p>   Do You Know Your Users?</p></h2></p><p></p>   That is a tough question to answer. It could mean so many different</p>   things. That's fairly obvious. But it's a question everyone who works</p>   with technology that other people use should ask themselves. I've</p>   often asked myself this question, and have come up with different</p>   answers at different times on different projects. I came to the</p>   realization at some point that for the most part I knew who my users</p>   were, and I had an idea of how they used my sites, but other than that</p>   all I had was a bunch of data and even more assumptions.</p></p></p><p></p>   I've been lucky enough to be involved in some formal usability studies</p>   before, and it was an informative, eye-opening experience. The main</p>   problem with these formal studies is that they are expensive. They are</p>   also arcane and time consuming. In my case we hired a company to come</p>   in, set up studies, conduct them and hand over the results at the end.</p>   I was able to weasel my way into these sessions as an observer and</p>   that was much more informative to me as one who actually works on the</p>   site than all of the statistics and reports combined.</p></p></p><p></p>   I couldn't help but think, &quot;Hey, I could do that.&quot; I'm the guy who</p>   actually designs and builds the sites, why not cut out the middleman?</p></p></p><p></p>   That's what this article is all about. I'm going to show you some ways</p>   to get to know your users in a real world, out-from-behind-the-glass</p>   kind of way. There is a place for formal usability and if you have the</p>   opportunity (read: time and money) to do them, I recommend doing so.</p>   It's also great to learn from what others have experienced, to read</p>   books on usability and to keep up with the gurus. I've done all of</p>   those and frankly they all pale in comparison to the information I get</p>   from, what I like to call, &quot;Gorilla Usability.&quot;</p></p></p><h2></p>   What Is Gorilla Usability?</p></h2></p><p></p>   Don't worry. I know how to spell. I imagine you've heard the term</p>   &quot;guerilla marketing&quot;? Well, it's kind of like that, but a lot less</p>   subtle. It's about getting out from behind the video camera, the</p>   reports, the stats and all the guru commandments and actually getting</p>   to know your users. It's about making that direct connection between</p>   the makers and the users. It's about getting into their world, seeing</p>   how they use your sites on their turf. It's about learning how to</p>   listen to what your users want, and getting past your own assumptions.</p></p></p><p></p>   There are many benefits to getting to know your users. Some are</p>   obvious and some are not so clear. If you make an effort to understand</p>   your users on every project you are involved in you will begin to be</p>   able to make design decisions that will save you time and grief down</p>   the road. Your sites will be better tailored to user wants and needs</p>   and in the long run you'll save your clients and organizations money</p>   as well as help to build a solid relationship with the people who</p>   matter most.</p></p></p><p></p>   Quite a bit of what I'm going to talk about it common sense, and</p>   really there are many directions you could go with this. The main</p>   thing is to make a commitment to get to know your users, doing</p>   something about that commitment and then following up with all the</p>   great user feedback and observations you'll have.</p></p></p><h2></p>   So, How Do I Start?</p></h2></p><p></p>   The hardest part about Gorilla Usability is getting that initial</p>   contact with your users. I've worked on many projects where the Web</p>   team is working in a vacuum, with little or no contact with the users</p>   aside from Web stats logs and the occasional e-mail. Depending on the</p>   type of project you are working on you have a few options here, and</p>   I'd stress that a few users are better than none (but none can be</p>   better than one or two &#8212; more on that later), so if you can put your</p>   designs in front of family members, friends or co-workers it's better</p>   than not trying to get user feedback at all.</p></p></p><p></p>   If you are working on a redesign or project that has another related</p>   site with existing users this will be easiest. There are a few ways to</p>   get some of your users to help out and most of those are free &#8212; or</p>   really cheap. It could be as simple as posting a link on your site, or</p>   sending an e-mail to your mailing list asking for participation in</p>   user studies. Make it clear that you are doing this to help them, and</p>   let them know you need their help to make a better experience for</p>   everyone. If you have a small user base or worse, apathetic users,</p>   offer a small gift or to feed them, that seems to work well. In my</p>   experience there are always a few people who are willing to help out</p>   and share their opinions with you. These folks are usually more</p>   engaged than the &quot;typical users&quot; that you'd get for a formal study -</p>   and they're usually free!</p></p></p><p></p>   Another method is a simple feedback form, or survey posted on your</p>   site. This works really well for Intranets or projects with highly</p>   engaged users. It's a great way to collect some basic user data and</p>   opinions and if you make a request for volunteers you'll quickly have</p>   a user base with which to set up you studies.</p></p></p><h2></p>   We've Got Volunteers. Now What?</p></h2></p><p></p>   Now comes the most tedious part. You'll need to set up appointments</p>   with your volunteers. This can be time consuming and frustrating at</p>   times, but hang in there. I've done this a few times now and it's gone</p>   fairly smoothly, I found that making sure they knew that you were</p>   going the extra mile and advocating for them seemed to help this</p>   along. You can have them come to you, or, what I'd suggest &#8212; you can</p>   go to them.</p></p></p><p></p>   Conducting the study at a user's home, desk or office will give you a</p>   greater insight into how they use your sites, and the Web in general.</p>   It'll be an extra effort on your part, but the payoff is great,</p>   believe me. You'll see things you'd have never seen in a classroom</p>   setting or at your own workstation. I recently did a study where we</p>   wanted to test a PDF form. We knew there were some problems with it,</p>   but we didn't have a handle of how people used this form on the Web.</p>   The idea was to have people fill it out online, save, print and then</p>   fax it in. Well, I went out to conduct the study at a few of our</p>   user's offices and I found out, to my complete surprise, that most of</p>   them didn't have a printer connected to the computer they used to hit</p>   the Web. They had a copy of the form and when they ran out they used</p>   the copy machine to make more. One office had only a small laptop</p>   connected directly to a DSL line. It was shared by five people, no</p>   network, no printer, nothing. And this was closer to our typical user</p>   than we'd ever dreamed.</p></p></p><p></p>   One thing to remember when setting up these studies is that if you</p>   have several people on your Web team conduct studies &#8212; which I think</p>   can be a really good idea, especially for small teams &#8212; you need to</p>   make sure that each person gets at least three users per study. If</p>   possible it would be good to do six or more. The problem with doing</p>   one or two users is that you tend to identify with those users and</p>   when it comes time to get your observations together and make a plan</p>   on improving your site you'll have a tough time seeing the big</p>   picture. Every user has particular problems, and some of these might</p>   be limited to that one user. You need to know when to let those go and</p>   take care of the issues that matter to the majority. In my experience</p>   it takes at least three users to begin to see patterns emerge.</p></p></p><h2></p>   Now Comes The Fun Part</p></h2></p><p></p>   You've got volunteers lined up, you've scheduled appointments to meet</p>   with them in their lairs, now what? You need a plan. It's Gorilla</p>   Usability, but it's still smart usability. What I like to do before I</p>   go out to conduct a study is write up a simple &quot;to do&quot; list for me and</p>   a simple script for the user. I put to paper what I want to tell the</p>   user and how I'd like to set up the study. I do this in a very loose</p>   manner, as these studies, unlike formal usability studies, tend to</p>   have a mind of their own and often go all over the place. That's a</p>   good thing in my mind, it keeps it interesting, makes it fun and may</p>   uncover some things about your users you might not have gotten to, but</p>   I at least try to have some semblance of order to them.</p></p></p><p></p>   The &quot;to do&quot; list is something like this:</p></p></p><ul></p>   <li></p>Thank the user for helping out, let them know what the study is</p>about, and that we are testing the site and not the user. Let them</p>know it's OK to make a wrong turn and that all their feedback will</p>help make a better user experience.</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Ask the user what they think the site is about, or if they use it</p>currently what they use it for. Ask them what they like and don't</p>like and just get a general feel for how they view the site.</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Have them look at the site as a whole. Ask what they think might be</p>in different areas of the site, or what different functions would</p>be for. Gauge their expectations and first impressions.</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Now give the users some tasks. Use a script based on some areas you</p>would like feedback on and some other general areas or functions.</p>Keep the user on track if possible, but note where they deviate.</p>Take notes, observe and encourage the user to keep talking about</p>what they are thinking. Try to avoid coaching unless the user asks</p>for help.</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>When the tasks are done, thank the user for their help.</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Ask the user for their general opinion and impression of the site</p>and the experience. Let them express how they felt while using the</p>site.</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>End the study. Make sure you give them your contact information in</p>case they have any more feedback.</p>   </li></p></ul></p><p></p>   That is just an example, your plan could be more or less detailed.</p>   It's just a road map for the study to help keep you focused. The next</p>   thing you'll want to prepare is a script for the user tasks. Pretty</p>   much what you want is some tasks for the user to do that will help</p>   simulate a typical session using your site. This will vary greatly</p>   depending on your project. For example, on a corporate Intranet you</p>   might have a script like this:</p></p></p><ul></p>   <li></p>From the home page find Human Resources</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Now locate the cafeteria menu</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Go back to the home page</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Search for information on the president of the company</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Locate the casual Friday policy</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Submit a classified ad</p>   </li></p>   <li></p>Find the holiday schedule</p>   </li></p></ul></p><p></p>   You get the idea. The trick here is to give them tasks to do without</p>   telling them how to do them. You'd say &quot;Find the weather in Sydney&quot;</p>   rather than, &quot;Go to the Weather page, choose Australia, then select</p>   Sydney from the drop down menu.&quot; This way you can observe how the user</p>   gets to that information. Lots of times they do exactly opposite of</p>   what you'd think.</p></p></p><p></p>   Once you've conducted the study and have lots of notes and</p>   observations your almost ready to start advocating for your users and</p>   solving some of their problems.</p></p></p><h2></p>   Almost Ready?</p></h2></p><p></p>   Well, yeah. Before I go on I wanted to let you know that there are a</p>   few other ways you can get some good data about your users aside from</p>   the studies. I've already mentioned having surveys and feedback forms</p>   on your site as a good way to get volunteers to help out with your</p>   studies. These are also nice things to have when collecting data to</p>   help you move forward solving issues.</p></p></p><p></p>   Another great way to help understand your users is by looking into</p>   your Web logs. This way you can get some data on what pages are used</p>   the most, where users are entering and leaving the site and lots of</p>   other interesting data. Alone this data is nice to have, but coupled</p>   with the feedback and usability study observation it becomes a</p>   powerful ally in helping you determine what issues to tackle first.</p></p></p><p></p>   There are many different software packages out there that can help you</p>   decipher these logs and put them into a format that you can read and</p>   use. One I particularly like is <a href=</p>   "http://www.clicktracks.com/" title="Opens in a new window"</p>	   target="_blank">ClickTracks</a> It takes your logs and</p>   couples them with the actual display of your Web site, showing you</p>   visually where and how often people click different links.</p></p></p><p></p>   There are lots more ways to connect with your users, so be creative.</p></p></p><h2></p>   Get to Work</p></h2></p><p></p>   Now you're ready to get to making your site a better place for your</p>   users. In my experience there are always a few obvious things you can</p>   take care of right away. If your logs are telling you that 60% of your</p>   users hit the menu on your restaurant site, but you moved the link to</p>   it with the new design and now people can't find it - you might want</p>   to fix that. What I do is go through all the data I have and start to</p>   identify patterns and similarities. Some are fairly obvious and some</p>   harder to find.</p></p></p><p></p>   Once we have these it's time to work out a plan for getting them taken</p>   care of, we've learned about our users needs and are ready to advocate</p>   for them in our project plans. We also have a basis from which we can</p>   make design decisions and another stakeholder to refer to when</p>   weighing options.</p></p></p><p></p>   It's also a good idea to keep the lines of communication open. Sites</p>   tend to evolve, business rules change, user bases change, heck,</p>   everything changes, and usability needs to be an ongoing process. Once</p>   you're done you should start thinking about the next round.</p></p></p><p></p>   I can say that these types of studies and just the effort of getting</p>   to know the users of my sites has made me a better designer, a more</p>   efficient developer and has saved me time and effort in the long run.</p>   Not to mention enhancing the experience of people who use my sites.</p>   There is a lot more to usability that this &#8212; all of it good stuff &#8212;</p>   but I like to boil usability down to one simple rule. Get to know your</p>   users. How you do that is up to you.</p></p>
