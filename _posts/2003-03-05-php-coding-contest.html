A new PHP Coding Contest is up at <a href="http://codewalkers.com/">Codewalkers.com</a>. The challenge this time is to create a script that will play the game of "Down-n-Out". This basically involves removing tiles from a grid in a strategic manner. The prizes include a Zend t-shirt, a copy of Zend Studio 2.5, any book you choose from Wrox Press, a free month of hosting from The Hosting Company, 2 domain names supplied by Dom-Daniel, a one year subscription to php architect, and an official PHP Coding Contest t-shirt from CafePress.
