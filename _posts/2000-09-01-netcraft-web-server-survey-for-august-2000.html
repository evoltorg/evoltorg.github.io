<p>The <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/" target="_new">Netcraft Web Server Survey</a> is a survey of Web Server software usage on Internet connected computers. They collect and collate as</p>many hostnames providing an http service as they can find, and systematically poll each one with an HTTP request for the server name. </p>In August they received responses from 19,823,296 sites. </p></p></p><p></p>This month, Apache continues its lead at the top of the Web Server survey, although both it and Microsoft's IIS lost a bit of ground to the up and coming <a href="http://www.zeus.co.uk/">Zeus webserver</a>, which is gaining popularity with bigger e-commerce sites like Ebay.</p></p><p></p>Linux also remains the mostly widely used Operating System to host web pages off, serving 35.73% of all websites compared with Microsofts(all flavors of windows) 21.32% or Sun's Solaris operating system which hosts about 20.35% of all sites on the Internet.</p></p><p></p>If you're interested in just how Netcraft compiles these statistics, you can <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/index-200007.html#active">read about their methodology</a> for yourself.</p></P>
