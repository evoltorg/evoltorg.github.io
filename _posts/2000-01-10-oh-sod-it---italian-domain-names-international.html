After a good while protecting the integrity of the .it namespace, any VAT-registered business in the EU will be able to register Italian domain names from 15th Jan.  <P></p>According to the story at <a href='http://www.theregister.co.uk/' title='New home of BOfH' target='_new'>TheRegister</a>, the names will go on sale at #100 initially, from <a href='http://www.vi.net/news/00021.htm' target='_blank'>VI</a>. <P></p>So much for the idea of knowing where a company or org is based from the domain name - another country bites the dust. <P></p>bugger.it <P>
