<p>\nIt's been almost three years in the making and surrounded by controversy the entire time. Thousands of people have helped build it, and thousands more have criticized it. The official 6.0 release of Netscape Navigator from AOL/Netscape has <a href="http://home.netscape.com/browsers/6/index.html" target="_new">been released</a> today.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is the first official release of the browser that is built upon freely available, open source <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_new">Mozilla</a> technology. There are lots of new features in this release which you can  <a href="http://home.netscape.com/browsers/6/datasheet/index.html?cp=cpi" target="_new">read about</a>, or you can <a href="http://home.netscape.com/download/index.html?cp=n6i" target="_new">download the browser</a> directly and see for yourself. Once we start using and testing it, we will post more information about this long-awaited browser.\n</p>
