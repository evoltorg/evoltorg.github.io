This is a perfect time to write an eBook. What the publishing industry needs are people who can deliver into the world of today - innovative thinkers who can make the transition and figure out how to solve old problems with new ideas. EBooks are a new and powerful tool for original thinkers with fresh ideas to disseminate information to millions of people who are struggling to figure out how to do an overabundance of different things.</p><p>Publishing an eBook is entirely different than publishing a book in print. Let's look at specifics of how the print and cyber publishing industry differ, and the many reasons why you should take the step and get your fingers tapping across the keyboard!</p><p>\nPerhaps you've checked out self-publishing and found out how expensive a venture it can be. Most "vanity presses" require minimal print runs of at least 500 copies, and even that amount will cost thousands of dollars. Some presses' minimal run starts at 1,000 to 2,000 copies. And that's just for the printing and binding. Add in distribution, shipping, and promotional costs and - you do the math. Even if you wanted to go this way, you may not have that kind of money to risk.</p><p>Let's say you already have an Internet business with a quality website and a quality product. An eBook is one of the most powerful ways to promote your business while educating people with the knowledge you already possess as a business owner of a specific product or service.</p><p>For example, if you've spent the last twenty-five years growing bonsai trees, and now you're ready to share your knowledge and experience. An eBook is the perfect way to reach the largest audience of bonsai trees enthusiasts. </p><p>EBooks will promote your business - help you make a name for you and your company, and establish you as an expert in your field. You may find you have enough to say to demand a series of eBooks. Specific businesses are complicated and often require the different aspects to be divided in order for the reader to get the entire story.</p><p>Perhaps your goals are more finely tuned in terms of the eBook scene. You may want to build a whole business around writing and publishing eBooks. Essentially, you want to start an e-business. You are thinking of setting up a website to promote and market your eBooks. Maybe you're even thinking of producing an ozone.</p><p>One of the most prevalent reasons people read eBooks is to find information about how to turn an Internet businesses into a profit-making machine. And these people are looking to the writers of eBooks to provide them with new ideas and strategies because writers of eBooks are usually people who understand the new cyberspace world we now live in. EBook writers are experts in Internet marketing campaigns and the strategies of promoting and distributing eBooks. The cyberspace community needs these eBooks to be successful so that more and more eBooks will be written.</p><p>You may want to create affiliate programs that will also market your eBook. Affiliates can be people or businesses worldwide that will all be working to sell your eBooks. Do you see a formula for success here?</p><p>Figure out your subject matter, and then narrow it down. Your goal is specificity. Research what's out already, and try to find a void that your eBook might fill.</p><p>What about an eBook about a birthday cake business? Or an eBook about caring for the elderly pets? How about the fine points of collecting vintage toys?</p><p>You don't need three master degrees to write about your subject. People need advice that is easy to read and understand. Parents need advice for dealing with their teenagers. College students need to learn good study skills - quickly. The possibilities are endless.\n
