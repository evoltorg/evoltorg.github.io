<p><a href="http://www.allaire.com/products/homesite/index.cfm" target="_blank">HomeSite</a>, a robust text-based HTML editor for the Wintel world, can be prodded to produce XHTML with a little help. Here's a guide to doing it in the current 4.5 version:</p></p><p>First, go to the Options menu, choose Settings, and configure what you can in the program that will start you down the XHTML path:</p></p><ul></p><li>Under &quot;HTML&quot;, check off: Lowercase all inserted tags, Include closing <code>&lt;/P&gt;</code> when inserting paragraph tag, and set the &quot;Center&quot; toolbutton to use <code>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</li></p><li>Under Editor/Tag Completion: turn this feature on and make sure all the proper HTML tags are in this list (the default that comes with the program does not include all tags).</li></p></ul></p><p>Before we get to the fun part (editing the program's internal files), let's note that HomeSite 4.5 does include the <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/" target="_blank">HTML Tidy</a> utility integrated into it, which can produce XHTML from HTML pretty readily. So if you don't want to mess further with the HomeSite program, HTML Tidy is a good way to go.</p></p><p>Now, to the good stuff: editing HomeSite's tag wizards to produce XHTML. Don't forget to <em>back up these files</em> before you edit them, because if you break them you'll probably have to reinstall the program to fix them.</p></p><p>The VTM files that make up the tag wizards are located in the /extensions/tagdefs/html directory. For each tag that needs to end with &quot; />&quot; (for example, <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>), open it's corresponding VTM file in HomeSite. Look for a line (usually towards the end of the file) that reads <code>&lt;WIZIF 1&gt;&gt;&lt;/WIZIF&gt;</code> and change it to read <code>&lt;WIZIF 1&gt; /&gt;&lt;/WIZIF&gt;</code>.</p></p><p>This works for all tags needing the closing slash except for <code>img</code>, which doesn't have a VTM file. You'll have to either take care of <code>img</code> tags manually, or use an alternate VTM file/wizard for your <code>img</code> tags. I use one by Marjolein Katsma, who originally wrote much of the VTML wizards for HomeSite. You can <a href="http://hshelp.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">get a copy</a> of it (called TagEditor_Toolbar_HS45.zip) from her web site if you're interested.</p></p><p>Next, we need to edit VTM files for tags such as <code>td</code>, where attributes like <code>nowrap</code> have to be rendered as <code>nowrap=&quot;nowrap&quot;</code>. Open the VTM file for the tag, and look for a line such as this one in the <code>td</code> file:</p></p><p><code>&lt;WIZIF checkNOWRAP EQ 'true'&gt;$$SpacingGap$${DefaultCase('NOWRAP')}&lt;WIZSET SpacingGap = VertSpacingGap&gt;&lt;/WIZIF&gt;</code></p></p><p>This line is basically outputting <code>nowrap</code> into the tag if the NOWRAP checkbox was checked off. So we just change the output:</p></p><p><code>&lt;WIZIF checkNOWRAP EQ 'true'&gt;$$SpacingGap$${DefaultCase('NOWRAP=nowrap')}&lt;WIZSET SpacingGap = VertSpacingGap&gt;&lt;/WIZIF&gt;</code></p></p><p>At this point, you have all the tag wizards (<code>img</code> aside) producing XHTML. Now, we edit the built-in validator so that it knows all this XHTML is valid:</p></p><ul></p><li>Follow the program menus to Options &gt; Settings &gt; Validation &gt; Validator Settings &gt; Tags &gt; HTML</li></p><li>For any tag that needs a closing &quot; />&quot;, go to it's Attributes folder. Add an attribute &quot;/&quot; to it, and make the attribute's value equal &quot;no value&quot;.</li></p><li>For tags with attributes that can no longer be minimized (e.g. <code>td nowrap=&quot;nowrap&quot;</code>):</li></p><ol></p><li>Go to the Values tab and add the value to the list (e.g. <code>nowrap</code>).</li></p><li>Go back to the Tags tab, go to the tag in question (e.g. <code>td</code>), and add the attribute (e.g. nowrap) to the list. Assign the value (e.g. nowrap) to the attribute.</li></p></ol></p></ul></p><p>With that, you should have HomeSite producing XHTML, and its built-in validator will recognize it as valid!</p>
