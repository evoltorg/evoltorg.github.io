<p>\nWhat are patterns and how can they help in building a successful site? We interviewed the authors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020172149X/evoltorg02-20/ref=nosim"target="_blank" title="Buy it at Amazon. Opens in a new window">The Design of Sites: Patterns, principles and processes for crafting a customer-centered web experience</a>.</p></p><p></p><p><p><strong>The title of your book is &quot;The Design of Sites&quot;, and at first sight it may seem just another book teaching how to build sites. Scanning it, however, it's immediately clear that it's completely different from any other book with a similar title. Why? And how did you choose to organize it? What is the audience of the book?</strong></p></p><p><p>A lot of books out there focus a lot on bad web sites, on common\nusability errors that you should avoid. A lot of these are actually\npretty funny, but the problem is that they don't help you build\ngood web sites.</p></p><p><p>Our book focuses on principles, processes, and patterns for\ncreating good web sites. By principles, we mean high level\nconcepts that guide the entire design process. An example\nof this is understanding the needs and capabilities of your\ncustomers before building anything. Another is understanding\nthe basics of color vision deficiency, to avoid combinations\nthat are difficult to see by people with this condition.</p></p><p><p>By processes, we mean how to put the principles into practice.\nThis includes things like the major steps and milestones for\ndeveloping a web site, how to run a survey, and how to run a\nusability test.</p></p><p><p>The largest portion of our book, though, is devoted to web\ndesign patterns. We've documented ninety patterns in areas\nlike navigation, home pages, content management, and page layout.</p></p><p><p><strong> What are patterns and how can they be applied to the web? May you give us an example taken from the book?</strong></p></p><p><p>Design patterns are a way of communicating common design problems\nthat web designers face, as well as solutions that work in practice.</p></p><p><p>For example, it's not always clear what images you can click on.\nTo solve this problem, designers often edit the images so that they\nlook like buttons you can press. As another exampe, it's not always\nclear where you are in a web site and where you can go next. To solve\nthis problem, designers invented navigation bars that are\nconsistently placed at the top and the left of web sites.</p></p><p><p>The goal of a design pattern is to capture the essence of a\nproblem and a working solution, describing what the goals and\nconstraints are, as well as what things work and what things don't.\nRather than re-inventing the wheel, it gives you a template and\nseveral examples to work off of.</p></p><p><p>We have an example pattern on <a href="http://designofsites.com" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">our web site</a> which describes the\n<a href="http://designofsites.com/about_the_book/patternh1.pdf" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Process Funnel</a>. In the Process Funnel, you go through a series\nof well-defined steps to accomplish a specific task such as creating\na new account or checking out.</p>    </p><p><p>However, individual patterns by themselves are only marginally\nuseful. What's really important is the pattern language, describing\nhow different patterns relate to one another. For example, the\nProcess Funnel might be part of an E-Commerce Site or an Intranet\n(two higher-level patterns). Also, when designing a Process Funnel,\none needs to keep in mind issues like Context-Sensitive Help, Above\nthe Fold, and Preventing Errors (three lower-level patterns).</p></p><p><p><strong>Isn't it too early to analize the web and organize a list of best practice into patterns?</strong></p></p><p><p>While it's true that the web is constantly evolving, things have\ndefinitely started to settle down. There aren't as many truly\nnovel and innovative designs as there were in the past. In many\nways, this is a good thing, because people have become more\ninterested in using the web to accomplish specific tasks rather\nthan just exploring for the fun of it.</p></p><p><p>What patterns offer here are designs that make full use of\npeople's expectations. There was this <a href="http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/3W/web_object.htm" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" title="Developing Schemas for the Location of Common Web Objects">interesting study</a> done\nby the psychology department at Wichita, giving people a blank\ngrid representing a web page, and asking people where they\nexpected things like the navigation bar, search form, and\nads to be. As you might have guessed, people were used to\nnavigation bars being at the top and at the left, search forms\nat the top or top-right, and ads near the top.</p></p><p><p>What's interesting here is that there is a co-evolution of both\npatterns and people's expectations. Patterns are based on\npeople's expectations and experiences with the web, and these\nin turn are based on what patterns are out in use on many web\nsites. It's an ongoing conversation.</p></p><p><p><strong>The book and the patterns are based on the discipline known as user \ncenter design. What is it, how is important, and how does it relate to the "User Experience"?</strong></p></p><p>\n<p>The key idea in user-centered design is to keep customers in\nthe loop throughout the entire design process, getting continual\nfeedback on the usefulness and usability of the web site. The\nbest way of doing this is by taking a design and iteratively\ngetting feedback from customers and reworking it until it fits\ntheir needs.</p></p><p><p>This is in contrast to a monolithic approach, where you might\nspeak to the customers once at the very beginning, spend a few\nmonths to build the entire web site, and then launch the site,\nonly to find out it doesn't work very well. With user-centered\ndesign, the idea is to take lots of small steps, rather than\none big step.</p></p><p><p>There is also an important distinction to make here between\ncustomers and clients. By &quot;customer&quot;, we mean any person who\nwill use the web site you are designing. By &quot;client&quot;, we mean\nthe people for whom you are doing the work, the people providing\nthe funding. For example, when building an intranet, the\nclients might be upper management, while the customers would be\nthe people who would actually use the web site. What we want to\nemphasize here is that it's really important to get feedback from\nthe customers, because they will determine the success or failure\nof the site, not the clients.</p></p><p><p>A lot of people have been talking about User Experience recently.\nUser Experience is more about the overall feel of a site, such as\nwhether it was fun and positive or an ordeal. User-centered design\nwould be one way of creating a positive User Experience, in\nunderstanding the needs and capabilities of your customers and\nmaking a web site that fulfills those needs.</p></p><p><p><strong>Do your patterns cover all the aspects of Internet and Intranet \ndesign, or is there something you decided not to include in the book, and if so why? And are there other discoveries you would have put into the book if you were writing it today?</strong></p></p><p><p>The 90 patterns in our book cover many aspects of web design, but\nclearly cannot cover everything. Our book is intended as part of an\nongoing conversation on web design.</p></p><p><p>We actually have ideas for several new patterns. In fact, one idea\nwe are looking at is design patterns for web applications, focusing\nspecifically on web sites that provide services like email and\nstock trading and so on.</p></p><p><p>As an aside, one of our original ideas for the book was to make\nthe patterns tear-outs, to make it easier for designers to organize\nthe ones that were relevant. That idea didn't pan out for various\nreasons. However, we've just finished creating one-page versions of\nall of the patterns, and for a limited time they are available free\nto customers who purchase the book at Amazon.com.</p></p><p><h2>About this interview</h2>\n<p>\nAn <a href="http://www.fucinaweb.com/design/designofsites.asp" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" lang="it">Italian translation</a> of the interview is available on <a href="http://www.fucinaweb.com" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window" lang="it">FucinaWeb</a>, the Italian resource for web standards, usability and accessibility.\n</p></p><p><h2>About the authors</h2>\n<p>\nDouglas van Duyne is president, chief executive officer, and\ncofounder of NetRaker Corporation, a leading provider of customer\nexperience management solutions.
