<p>Note: this article is not about web based interfaces to email, like Yahoo email </p>  or Hotmail. It's about using email as an interface to websites or web services.</p></p><p>Mailing list managers have long used a <strong>command based</strong> email interface </p>  to manage the mailing list. <strong>Link based</strong> email interfaces (unsubscribe </p>  links) are common in email newsletters and mailing list, and job websites also </p>  typically offer email interfaces using links. Online vendors use <strong>HTML based</strong> </p>  emails with forms to sell products.</p></p><p> Email as an interface to websites hasn't been explored much by the interaction </p>  design community. And yet email has some key advantages: it's fast and asynchronous</p>  (you can fill in the interface, and the next time you connect to the Internet </p>  send the email), and allows for requested interaction.</p></p><p>Here is a screenshot of an email interface from <a href="http://mail4mykids.com/howitworks.asp">Mail4mykids.com</a></p></p><p><img src="http://evolt.org/evolt/images/485/emailinterface.gif" width="541" height="462" alt="example of email interface" border="1"></p></p><h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Email Interfaces</h2></p><p>Email interfaces have some key advantages over web interfaces:</p></p><ol></p>  <li><p><strong>Asynchronous interaction</strong><br></p>  You don't have to be online while giving </p>    the commands. A significant advantage for many people who have limited Internet </p>    access. <a href="/Email_Interface_Design_101#1">[1]</a></p></li></p>  <li><p><strong>Requested interaction</strong><br>Software systems can request interaction by </p>    sending you an email.</p></li></p>  <li><p><strong>Speed</strong><br></p>  You can send commands from your email application, which will </p>    often be faster than opening a website.</p></li></p></ol></p><p>A main advantage of email interfaces, asynchronicity, is also its main disadvantage, </p>  in that there is no immediate feedback. Feedback from the system can </p>  take over 10 minutes because of email delays on the Internet. This means that </p>  <strong>email interfaces are mainly useful for one step interactions</strong>: you get </p>  some input and you decide on an action. You shouldn't use email interfaces when:</p></p><ol></p>  <li><p><strong>Immediate feedback to the user is required upon action.</strong><br>Email delivery </p>    can experience delays of 10 minutes or longer.</p></li></p>  <li><p><strong>Tasks require multiple steps in a short time interval.</strong><br></p>  You don't </p>    want the person using this interface to have to wait for the next email to </p>    continue. </p></li></p></ol></p><p>The asynchronocity of the interaction also means that UNDO becomes even more </p>  important, since no immediate feedback is available. </p></p><p>Requested interaction is a unique advantage of email compared to web based </p>  interfaces, but not limited to requesting action through email interfaces: requests </p>  can be sent use a web interface as well. </p></p><p>Speed of the email interface is mainly accomplished by not having to leave </p>  your email program: starting up a browser and connecting to a website can take </p>  up to 15 seconds, a time delay in which the task might already have been completed </p>  using an email interface. The time gains are small, but add up for often repeated </p>  actions.</p></p><h2>Input and Output in Email Interfaces</h2></p><p>The main consideration to make once you've decided to use an email interface </p>  is how to deal with input and output, commands and feedback. Here's what we </p>  have to play with when building an email interface:</p></p><ul></p>  <li><p><strong>The email address</strong><br></p>  Addresses can contain information, like <code>script_submit_123@domain.com</code></p></li></p>  <li><p><strong>Additional headers</strong><br></p>  You can make up headers with email, but you can't </p>    easily edit these headers in most email programs.</p></li></p>  <li><p><strong>The body of the text.</strong><br></p>  Which can be text only or HTML</p></li></p>  <li><p><strong>Attachments.</strong><br></p>  <a href="http://www.efax.com/toolkit/emailinterface.html">eFax</a>'s</p>    email Fax interface (<a href="http://a248.g.akamai.net/7/248/528/001/efax.com/toolkit/images/sample.gif">screenshot</a>) </p>    for example treats any attachment as a document to be faxed by the service.</p></li></p></ul></p><p>These technical constraints limit the things we can do with email. Given these </p>  constraints, and looking around on the web, here are the three basic styles </p>  of email interface interaction: </p></p><ol></p>  <li><p><strong>Command line style</strong><br></p>  The subject and body of the email contain text </p>    commands like &quot;subscribe&quot; or &quot;start-content&quot;. </p></p>	<p>Command line style interaction requires the user to learn to use certain </p>  commands, and introduces possible errors: commands can be misspelled, wrong </p>  commands can be given. Command line style interfaces are emailed back to the </p>  server, allowing for asynchronous interaction. <strong>Because of their learning </p>  curve, command line style email interfaces are useful mainly for power users.</strong> </p>  A special case of command line interaction is when the user is requested to </p>  reply to an email that already contains the relevant commands - mailing list </p>  software often uses this to confirm subscriptions.</p></p>	</li></p>  <li><p><strong>Link based style</strong><br></p>  The email contains links like &quot;Delete this </p>    entry: http://domain.com/delete?12&quot; that can execute commands. </p></p>	<p>Link based style interaction is easy (just click the link) and error </p>  free, but requires the user to be online while using it, thus loosing one of </p>  the key benefits of email interfaces: asynchronicity. They retain the speed </p>  advantage, which is why these are also widely used for simple interactions like </p>  subscribing or unsubscribing.</p></li></p>  <li><p><strong>HTML based style</strong><br></p>  HTML forms, posted to a webpage. Browser opens </p>    after posting.</p></p>	<p>HTML based style interaction allows for a rich interaction environment, </p>  providing all the HTML widgets (dropdowns, checkboxes, ...) people are used </p>  to using. However, it requires people to be online, thus again loosing a main </p>  advantage of email interfaces, and it still retains all of the disadvantages </p>  of email interaction.</p></li></p></ol></p><p>  <div class="side" style="padding:5px;"></p>  <p style="margin-top:0px;"></p>  <strong>Question</strong>:<br></p>  Could an HTML form that is sent to someone be replied to, </p>    keeping the form intact? The form is filled in and emailed (not POSTed) </p>    to the server.</p>	</p></p>	<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">Would it be possible to make the form values be transmitted </p>    to the server via a reply-to? This would provide the rich interaction possibilities </p>    of HTML and yet allow for asynchronous interaction at the same time. </p></p></div></p><h2>Conventions</h2></p><p>There are a few conventions that have already evolved for email interfaces:</p></p><ul></p>  <li>Explain the user where the email comes from and what to do next if they </p>    aren't used to the interaction. A good example is the &quot;This is an automatic </p>    email, no reply is necessary&quot;. </li></p>  <li>Have subject lines that are easily filterable, preferably contained within </p>    square brackets. Having a subject line include something like [feedback domain.com] </p>    makes it easier for people to manage their incoming email.</li></p>  <li>Avoid too many email being sent, rather compile them into one big email </p>    if possible. Nobody likes receiving heaps of email. </li></p></ul></p><h2>Examples of Email Interfaces</h2></p><ul><li>Command line style: <a href="http://sanskrit.gde.to/web-interface/itrans-convert-readme.html">Translation </p>  email interface</a>, <a href="http://www.musi-cal.com/email-instructions.html">another </p>  interface to a music database</a>.</li></p><li><a href="http://capescience.capeclear.com/google/index.shtml">An email interface </p>  to the Google API</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.bellanet.org/email.html">Web to email server</a>: allows </p>  you to surf the web if you only have email.</li></p></ul></p><p><a href="http://jefflash.com/">Jeff Lash</a> offers some more examples:</p></p><blockquote><p>Long ago it used to be common for people to provide information via </p>  auto responders &quot;For our price list, send an email to prices@ourwebsite.com&quot;. </p>  It was used for situations where they didn't want to provide data online for </p>  all to see but wanted it to be available to people who wanted it. Just last </p>  week I saw a personal site that had a &quot;Want my resume? Send an email to </p>  resume@mysite.com&quot; link, but I forget the name of the person/site. [...] </p>  Microsoft Outlook lets you send invitations and questions through email. </p></p><p>  At work we use the Approve/Deny a lot for any changes to the IT infrastructure.</p>  I send out a request to people who need to approve it, and they just click the </p>  appropriate button in the email. You can do voting and create custom buttons, </p>  and whoever sends the email out can track responses. Of course this is a MS </p>  extension to email.</p></p></blockquote></p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>Email interfaces can be powerful tools that support repetitive one step tasks, </p>  and offer some unique productivity advantages for people with limited time and </p>  Internet connectivity.</p></p><p>The design of email interfaces has typically been left to developers with little </p>  time and resources to spend on this. It is high time the interaction design </p>  community took up the unglamorous task of designing quality email interactions.</p></p>  <hr></p><p>Article history: This article originally appeared on <a href="http://poorbuthappy.com/ease/emailinterface/">poorbuthappy.com</a></p></p><p><a name="1">[1]</a> Of course, not all email interfaces have this property. Asynchronous interaction </p>  is possible with websites as well, but in practice it's too scary to fill in </p>  a form while not connected. Unique ids time out, the server gets confused, </p>  and too often you get an error message when connecting back and submitting the </p>  form, which means you can start from scratch.</p>
