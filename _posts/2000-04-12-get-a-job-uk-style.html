Tips on getting a webdesign job:</p><p>Let�s imagine you have been learning HTML and stuff for the past year or so, and now you�re ready for your first real job.\n                                        Since you want to live in Europe you head for the place to be: London. You are allowed to work there, of course.</p><p><OL>\n<LI>Wear comfortable footwear.\n<LI>Make a nice resume (cv) in Word format.\n<LI>Have a few url�s for people to look at\n<LI>Now submit your cv (after a last spellcheck) to a few jobsites. You can subscribe to them and have daily joblistings sent to you as well. A good one to start is: <a href="http://www.jobsite.co.uk" Target="TOP"> http://www.jobsite.co.uk</A>\n</OL></p><p>Now what�s gonna happen is that lots of agencies are gonna look at your cv. They get warned automatically if a cv that has certain keywords in it is put on. Within a week, you�ll see your cv has been looked at hundreds of times.</p><p>Those daily job-emails you�re getting (remember?) should have one or two in them each day that are suitable for you, even if you�re a beginner. Apply for them (properly).</p><p>All this is meant for the agencies to get to know you. When a job comes up, you want to be on top of their heads.</p><p>Also, by now, you should physically be in London. And get a mobile phone (yes they�re evil, but you NEED to be contactable immediately).</p><p>Agents wills start calling you. The good ones ask before sending your cv to an employer, the bad ones just arrange the interview without knowing for sure it�s a match, wasting your time and upsetting the employers. The jobs you�ve applied for yourself will start contacting you as well for interviews.</p><p>So now you�re on a roll. Running around town, this is where the footwear comes in (I knew you were wondering about that).</p><p>Finally, a few remarks:\nAgencies get paid very well if you get the job. Therefore, if you�re looking for an internship, don�t use them (too expensive for the employer).\nShow enthusiasm in the interview. Literally tell them you really want to work with them. They like that.\nDon�t be afraid to ask questions in the interviews.</p><p>That�s all, have fun, and good luck!\n
