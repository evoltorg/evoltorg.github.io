<p>The only thing shorter than a New York minute, is an email one.</p>\n<p>Does this conversation sound familiar?</p>\n<blockquote> \n<p>&quot;Did you get my email?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;What email?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The one I sent you today.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I didn't get the email. When did you send it?&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;15 minutes ago.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it goes. A recent survey by TargetX, an email marketing firm, \nindicated that 13 percent of their respondents said they'd take their \nbusiness elsewhere if they don't receive a response to email within \none hour.  Fifteen percent said they were willing to wait up to \nthree hours. Eight percent said they would wait six hours.  Almost \neveryone (88 percent) expected a response within 24 hours.</p>\n<p>To customers, waiting for an email response has become the \nequivalent of standing in line. This means that your company \n<em>may be</em> losing potential business if it doesn't provide an immediate \nresponse to incoming emails. It probably <em>is</em> losing potential business \nif it's not responding to emails the same day they are received.  </p>\n<p>There are several things a business can do to alleviate the \npotential impatience/anxiety of customers who await an immediate \nresponse to their emails:</p>\n<h2>Respond</h2>\n<p>It's a good idea to send people an email response as soon as possible -- \neven one that doesn't answer their specific questions or address their \nimmediate concerns. A quick response that acknowledges that the message has \nbeen received and sets expectations for when they will be contacted \nagain with an answer is often enough to placate, if not satisfy, an anxious inquirer.\n<h2>Instruct</h2>\n<p>A lot of the emails you receive don't provide enough information for \nyou to give an immediate answer. When offering individuals the opportunity \nto contact you, let them know in advance the information they need to provide \nto get an immediate answer. </p>\n<h2>Direct</h2>\n<p>Routing all emails through a webmaster, who divvies them out to \nthe appropriate person, is inefficient.  When soliciting emails from your \nweb site, try to route incoming emails to the appropriate person rather \nthan having a single individual respond to all emails. For example, sales \ninquiries might be sent to the appropriate sales person, based on the \nlocation of the sender. </p>\n<h2>Redirect</h2>\n<p>Give individuals an opportunity to call you if they're not getting \nwhat they consider to be a timely response.  This is particularly important \nfor customer service issues. As they strive to become more efficient, \ncustomer service departments often make themselves the most difficult \nindividuals to contact. </p>\n<h2>Follow Up</h2>\n<p>After responding to someone's email inquiry, take the time to \ncircle back by email, or telephone, to ensure that the individual was \nsatisfied with your response.  Did they find the product or service they \nwere looking for, even if they did not select your company? The responses \nto your follow-up provide a valuable view of your company, its products, \nand competitors.  </p>\n<h2>Phone</h2>\n<p>A May, 2003, Meta survey indicated that 80% of business people prefer \ncommunicating by email to using the phone.  Nevertheless, knowing when \nto pick up the phone is important. If individuals provide their phone \nnumber and invite you to call them within the body of an email, consider \npicking up the phone. It will likely provide more goodwill than email. \nAs one person put it: </p>\n<blockquote><p>&quot;I prefer e-mail with people I don't care much to \ndeal with, or don't have the time to deal with it. However when I want \nsomething, I prefer the phone because of the immediate interaction.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The challenges of email time compression can be met. Although the average \nperson may receive more than 50 to 100 emails a day, few of them require a \nresponse. A 2002 study from \nthe Pew Internet and American Life Project found that 60 percent of \nAmericans who use e-mail at work receive 10 or fewer actual work-related \nemails per day after filtering through the unwanted Spam mails.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the number of emails we receive each day is \npredicted to increase exponentially over the next decade with increases \nin Web services, wireless access, and the integration of technology.  </p>\n<p>Have any doubts about this? Email them to me. Or, email them to my cell phone. \nOr, email them to my wristwatch.
