excerpt: "The only thing shorter than a New York minute is an email one. How to manage the expectations of emailers."

<p>The only thing shorter than a New York minute, is an email one.</p></p><p>Does this conversation sound familiar?</p></p><blockquote> </p><p>&quot;Did you get my email?&quot;</p></p><p>&quot;What email?&quot;</p></p><p>&quot;The one I sent you today.&quot;</p></p><p>&quot;I didn't get the email. When did you send it?&quot;</p></p><p>&quot;15 minutes ago.&quot;</p></p></blockquote></p><p>So it goes. A recent survey by TargetX, an email marketing firm, </p>indicated that 13 percent of their respondents said they'd take their </p>business elsewhere if they don't receive a response to email within </p>one hour.  Fifteen percent said they were willing to wait up to </p>three hours. Eight percent said they would wait six hours.  Almost </p>everyone (88 percent) expected a response within 24 hours.</p></p><p>To customers, waiting for an email response has become the </p>equivalent of standing in line. This means that your company </p><em>may be</em> losing potential business if it doesn't provide an immediate </p>response to incoming emails. It probably <em>is</em> losing potential business </p>if it's not responding to emails the same day they are received.  </p></p><p>There are several things a business can do to alleviate the </p>potential impatience/anxiety of customers who await an immediate </p>response to their emails:</p></p><h2>Respond</h2></p><p>It's a good idea to send people an email response as soon as possible -- </p>even one that doesn't answer their specific questions or address their </p>immediate concerns. A quick response that acknowledges that the message has </p>been received and sets expectations for when they will be contacted </p>again with an answer is often enough to placate, if not satisfy, an anxious inquirer.</p><h2>Instruct</h2></p><p>A lot of the emails you receive don't provide enough information for </p>you to give an immediate answer. When offering individuals the opportunity </p>to contact you, let them know in advance the information they need to provide </p>to get an immediate answer. </p></p><h2>Direct</h2></p><p>Routing all emails through a webmaster, who divvies them out to </p>the appropriate person, is inefficient.  When soliciting emails from your </p>web site, try to route incoming emails to the appropriate person rather </p>than having a single individual respond to all emails. For example, sales </p>inquiries might be sent to the appropriate sales person, based on the </p>location of the sender. </p></p><h2>Redirect</h2></p><p>Give individuals an opportunity to call you if they're not getting </p>what they consider to be a timely response.  This is particularly important </p>for customer service issues. As they strive to become more efficient, </p>customer service departments often make themselves the most difficult </p>individuals to contact. </p></p><h2>Follow Up</h2></p><p>After responding to someone's email inquiry, take the time to </p>circle back by email, or telephone, to ensure that the individual was </p>satisfied with your response.  Did they find the product or service they </p>were looking for, even if they did not select your company? The responses </p>to your follow-up provide a valuable view of your company, its products, </p>and competitors.  </p></p><h2>Phone</h2></p><p>A May, 2003, Meta survey indicated that 80% of business people prefer </p>communicating by email to using the phone.  Nevertheless, knowing when </p>to pick up the phone is important. If individuals provide their phone </p>number and invite you to call them within the body of an email, consider </p>picking up the phone. It will likely provide more goodwill than email. </p>As one person put it: </p></p><blockquote><p>&quot;I prefer e-mail with people I don't care much to </p>deal with, or don't have the time to deal with it. However when I want </p>something, I prefer the phone because of the immediate interaction.&quot;</p></p></blockquote></p><p>The challenges of email time compression can be met. Although the average </p>person may receive more than 50 to 100 emails a day, few of them require a </p>response. A 2002 study from </p>the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that 60 percent of </p>Americans who use e-mail at work receive 10 or fewer actual work-related </p>emails per day after filtering through the unwanted Spam mails.</p></p><p>Nevertheless, the number of emails we receive each day is </p>predicted to increase exponentially over the next decade with increases </p>in Web services, wireless access, and the integration of technology.  </p></p><p>Have any doubts about this? Email them to me. Or, email them to my cell phone. </p>Or, email them to my wristwatch. You can do all three at my web site: </p><a href="http://www.onlinearts.net" target="_blank">http://www.onlinearts.net</a>.  </p></p><p>And if you do, please don't expect a response within an hour.</p>
