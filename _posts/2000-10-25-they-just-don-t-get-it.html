<p>Someone in my company recently asked me for help</p>with a Javascript error she was getting.  "Sure," I said, </p>being an old programmer who loves a challenge.  The problem</p>was on a very well-known Canadian corporation's Web site, </p>which  several people inside our company use on a regular basis, and </p>who knows how many thousands in the real world.  It was happening in </p>Netscape but not Internet Explorer.</p></p><p>Here's the code that was generating the error --</p></p><p style="font-family:monospace;font-size:12px"></p>    &nbsp; &lt;input type="text" name="origin" size="10" value=""&gt;</p><br>&nbsp; &lt;img src="/images/nav/home/down_arrow.gif"</p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;    width="16" height="22" align="absmiddle"</p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;    alt="Choose a City" border="0"</p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;    onMouseDown="setMouseDown(event, self);"</p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;    onMouseUp="openWindow(event, self,</p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;       'schedules/scheduling/cityOptions.html',</p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;       'newWindow__schedule_origin__schedule_org',</p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;       390, 140);"&gt;</p></p></p><p>"Wow," I opined. "That is so cool!" &nbsp;</p>"Shaddap, Rudy.  You're talking out loud again," </p>came a voice from over the cubicle partition.</p><p>This was the first time I had ever seen anything like this.  </p>It's a combination INPUT TEXT field and a</p>special "down arrow" gif, and  together they look <em>just</em> like a dropdown select list.</p>When you click on the image that looks like the down arrow of</p>a dropdown list, a small window pops up which contains --</p>are you ready for this? -- a dropdown list!  You pick an entry from the list, </p>and it gets populated back into the text box.  </p>(How do I know this? Because it works fine in Internet Explorer. However,</p>Netscape is our company standard.) You have to close the popup window </p>using the Close button, but that's a minor quibble.  Alternatively, if you know</p>what you want, you can type it right into the text box.  Not a bad idea, </p>a combination input/dropdown control.  Too bad it throws an error</p>in Netscape, eh?  </p><p>"Okay, I'll get to the bottom of this," I said -- to myself, this time.</p>There's a Contact page, I'll write to the webmaster.</p></p><p>Here's what transpired.</p>Note that I've changed the domain to foobar.ca  because</p>they did not give me permission to post their emails and make fun of them on </p>a public site, although I daresay they probably would never know it.</p></p></p><p><style></p> .rudy { font-family:monospace; color:#000066; font-size:12px }</p></style></p><p><div align=center></p><table width="90%" bgcolor=#FFFFEE border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"></p><tr><td><p class="rudy">2000-10-03 15:47</p><br>&nbsp; hi webmaster</p><br>&nbsp; several people in our company are reporting javascript errors using your home page</p><br>&nbsp;    "JavaScript Error: http://www.foobar.ca/home.html, line 705: init is not defined."</p><br>&nbsp; plus a couple others (possibly related)</p><br>&nbsp; seems to be only certain versions of netscape (not sure)</p><br>&nbsp; internet explorer 4.01 works okay</p><br>&nbsp; rudy limeback</p></td></tr></p></table></div> </p><p><p>It was <b>ten (10) days</b> before the answer came back:</p></p><p><div align=center></p><table width="90%" bgcolor=#FFFFEE border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"></p><tr><td><p class="rudy">2000-10-13 10:13</p><br>&nbsp;Hello,</p><br>&nbsp; that will occur with older browsers.</p><br>&nbsp; Our website is compatible with versions of 4 +</p><br>&nbsp; regards,</p><br>&nbsp; webmaster@foobar.ca</p></td></tr></p></table></div></p><p><p>Duh.
