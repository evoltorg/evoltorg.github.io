<p>Imagine, you're connecting to a mySQL database with PHP, but hell, you want a bit more robustness. So why would you want just one database? You'd use a failover right? So if the first database is down or just doesn't connect, it can connect to the next one. Here's how to do that (I'm assuming you're already replicating between databases so that they're roughly in sync).</p></p></p><p>Here's how you do it.

But, oh, it's the second one. Strange, isn't it?</p>Now, you can check if the database connected or not by checking if its true, or false.</p></p></p></p><p></p>Of course, how does it connect to the second database?

It has some <code>mysql_error()</code> stuff in it too, and checks if the url is <code>connection.php?type=1</code> before executing the code.
