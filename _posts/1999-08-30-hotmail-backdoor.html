According to an article at <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">slashdot.org</a>, Microsoft's Hotmail service has been backdoored.<P></p>What this means basically, is that all a person needs to read your email, and send email in your name, is your user name. All the gory details(including links) can be found <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/99/08/30/1324206.shtml">over here.</a> This is a pretty serious security hole, I tried it, and can personally vouch that it works. Take the appropriate action folks..
