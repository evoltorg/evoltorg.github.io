Online music retailing is growing quickly in Australia. ChaosMusic and Sanity have </p><p>listed on the stock exchange. HMV has partnered with digitalone. Fudge Music have built </p><p>themselves a store. Chaos has decided to acquire Gaslight Music.</p><p>But it seems that <b>all</b> of them have completely forgotten to include critical </p><p>information in their music listings.</p><p>Pick up a music CD (or look at your MP3 playlist for an even better example). There's </p><p>probably a title, an artist name, and some gruesome pictures (no wait, that might just </p><p>be my CD collection)... Now, flip it over, and more often than not, you'll find a </p><p>listing of the tracks to be found on the CD. Sometimes they'll also tell you how long </p><p>each track is.</p><p>However, if you're purchasing music online in Australia, consider yourself lucky to </p><p>find any track information. This isn't a problem if you're looking to pick up a copy of </p><p>Master of Puppets (Metallica) that you know back to front, and have had your eyes on </p><p>for years, but if you simply want to check if their new release S&amp;M includes a </p><p>particular track - well, good luck.</p><p>Editor of <a href="http://www.newswire.com.au/" target="_new">Newswire</a>, Angus Kidman writes in a </p><p>recent article - <a href="http://www.newswire.com.au/0001/dg28.htm" target="_new">Not enough </p><p>information</a> - that his purchasing is done at <a </p><p>href="http://www.cdnow.com/" target="_new">CDnow</a> almost entirely due to the fact that he cannot </p><p>find track details on the sites of Australian music retailers.</p><p>Perhaps if they spent more time building a site packed with useful information, instead </p><p>of racing to beat competitors to public offerings...</p><p>What do you think? Have you seen similar examples in sites around the planet? Let </p><p>everyone know by commenting below.
