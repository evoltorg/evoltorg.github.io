Chris Worth has an excellent <a href="http://chrisworth.com/creativework/content.pdf" target="_new">exposition</a> of why content is a better marketing tool than advertising - says it better than I can.<p> Of note are the theories:<ol> <li>for every piece of web-based content you create, ask yourself "could this be done on television?" If it could, your idea's not strong enough. <li>Graphic design can attract surfers to your site - once. But only content can keep them coming back. So forget about design; that's something any art director can slap on in a day. </ol> <P> (NB the link is a .pdf, so you'll need <a href="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html#reader" target="_new">Acrobat Reader</a>) <P>
