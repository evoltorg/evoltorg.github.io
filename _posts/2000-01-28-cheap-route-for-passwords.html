This is a way to weakly password protect a web page with javascript. Of course, I would not trust anything truly valuable behind this holey veil... <P>\nI did not come up with the idea, but cannot recall where I srcubbed it from. This was written for someone else as a demo. <P>\n   The correct password is the file name (plus ".html") for the destination page, some cryptic name file <P>\n A wrong passwrd will generate a NOT FOUND message  while the correct one will transfer you there     The beauty here is that even if you look at this source code  you still cannot find the correct password! <P>\n<a href='http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/eye/code/password/' target='_blank'>http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/eye/code/password/</a> <P>\nNote that the correct password is hinted down the screen... <P>
