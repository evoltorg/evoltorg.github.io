<P>Ran accross the most interesting, not to mention nostalgic, Web site today - the <a href="http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~clau/mozilla/" target="_new" title="Opens new window">Netscape Time Capsule</a>. Lots of history, screenshots, and old Mozilla logos from the company that introduced the browser to millions of people.</P> <P> My favorite part of it is <a href="http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~clau/mozilla/1/a.html" target="_new" title="Opens new window">this posting</a> from MarcA announcing the arrival of his new software to the Internet.(Yes, back then you could announce something to the entire Internet with a singular email/usenet post ;) </P> <P>Ahh the memories of a simpler time..</P>
