Thanks to the efforts of <a href='http://www.unmetered.org.uk' target='_blank'>CUT</a> and others, British Telecom have finally caved in and offered a set of unmetered tariffs for Net access in the UK. <P></p>The prices are reported to be set at:<ul> <li>&pound;6.99 per month for off-peak (6pm-8am) weekday access <li>&pound;13.99 per month for off-peak (6pm-8am) weekday and weekend access <li>&pound;34.99 per month for unrestricted access</ul> <P></p>It works out such that if you spend 3 hours a week or more online, you'll be saving money. <P></p>It looks like you have to be both a BT phone customer <b>and</b> a customer of their ISP (or an ISP which has BT as its connectivity provider) to benefit from this deal. <P></p>Get the full story at the <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_554000/554072.stm' target='_blank' title='Good old BBC'>BBC</a>. <P>
