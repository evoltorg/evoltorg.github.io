user_biog: "<p>Martin Burns has been doing this stuff since <a href=\"http://news.com.com/Netscape+bowed%2C+but+not+broken/2100-1032_3-5406682.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netscape 1.0</a> days. Starting with the communication ends that online media support, he moved back through design, HTML and server-side code. Then he got into running the whole show.
These days he\'s working for <a href=\"http://www-5.ibm.com/services/uk/services/bcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these people</a> as a Project Manager, and still thinks (nearly 6 years on) it\'s a hell of a lot better than working for a dot-com. In his Copious Free Time&trade;, he helps out running a <a href=\"http://www.purpur.co.uk/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloth Nappies</a> online store.
</p>

<p>Amongst his favourite things is <del><strike><a href=\"http://www.zope.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">Zope</a></strike></del><ins><a href=\"http://drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal</a></ins>, which he uses to run his <a href=\"http://www.easyweb.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">personal site</a>. He\'s starting to (re)gain a sneaking regard for ECMAscript since the arrival of unobtrusive scripting.</p> 

<p>He\'s been a member of evolt.org since the very early days, a board member, a president, a writer and even contributed a modest amount of template code for the current site. Above all, he likes evolt.org to do things because it knowingly chooses to do so, rather than randomly stumbling into them. He\'s also one of the boys and girls who beervolts in the UK, although the arrival of small children in his life have knocked the frequency for 6.</p>

Thanks to the efforts of <a href='http://www.unmetered.org.uk' target='_blank'>CUT</a> and others, British Telecom have finally caved in and offered a set of unmetered tariffs for Net access in the UK. <P></p>The prices are reported to be set at:<ul> <li>&pound;6.99 per month for off-peak (6pm-8am) weekday access <li>&pound;13.99 per month for off-peak (6pm-8am) weekday and weekend access <li>&pound;34.99 per month for unrestricted access</ul> <P></p>It works out such that if you spend 3 hours a week or more online, you'll be saving money. <P></p>It looks like you have to be both a BT phone customer <b>and</b> a customer of their ISP (or an ISP which has BT as its connectivity provider) to benefit from this deal. <P></p>Get the full story at the <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_554000/554072.stm' target='_blank' title='Good old BBC'>BBC</a>. <P>
