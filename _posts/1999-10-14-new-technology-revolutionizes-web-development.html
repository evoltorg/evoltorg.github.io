The man responsible for creating Microsoft's DirectX multimedia API has developed a new technology called <a href="http://www.wildtangent.com">Wild Tangent</a>. The technology is based around using DirectX in conjunction with existing web technologies such as CGI, Java and ActiveX, to enable the streaming of high quality multimedia and 3D content into a users web browser. Because <a href="http://www.wildtangent.com">Wild Tangent</a> is different from other existing web and multimedia platforms in that it allows developers to stream the same content found in DirectX games and multimedia applications to be streamed over the web, thus expanding the possibilities for content creation immensely. Check out the <a href="http://www.wildtangent.com">Wild Tangent</a> web site for more info. <P> <P>
