<p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is, however, an abbreviation. So what <em>is</em> an acronym?</p></p><p><p>Unlike, say the <a href="http://www.academie-francaise.fr/role/index.html" target="_blank" title="Le r&ocirc;le de l&rsquo;Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise">French language</a>, there is no official body that determines what is and isn&#8217;t proper English. Like the Web, though, there are a series of recommendations from recognized organizations. And, again, like the Web, there are those who  disagree with the generally agreed upon usage. Nevertheless, most lexicographers would likely agree with <cite style="font-style: italic" title="10th Edition">Merriam-Webster&#8217;s Collegiate Dictionary</cite> which defines:</p></p><ul></p>	<li>an <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=acronym" target="_blank" title="'Acronym' defined at Merriam-Webster Online">acronym</a> as &#8220;a word (as NATO, radar, or snafu) formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term;&#8221;</li></p>	<li>an <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=abbreviation" target="_blank" title="'Abbreviation' defined at Merriam-Webster Online">abbreviation</a> as &#8220;a shortened form of a written word or phrase used in place of the whole.&#8221;</li></p></ul></p><p><p>The <cite title="ISBN: 0-19-214183-X" style="font-style: italic;">Oxford Companion to the English Language</cite> goes so far as to define three types of acronyms:</p></p><ul></p>	<li>&#8220;letter acronyms&#8221; (like <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci748437,00.html" target="_blank" title="Whatis.com definition of 'FUBAR'">FUBAR</a>, <a href="http://www.saila.com/usage/glossary/defn.shtml?gif" target="_blank" title="Condensed Net Glossary definition of 'GIF'">GIF</a>)</li></p>	<li>&#8220;syllable acronyms&#8221; (like <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/Usenet.html" target="_blank" title="Jargon File definition of 'Usenet'">Usenet</a>, <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/sysadmin.html" target="_blank" title="Jargon File definition of 'sysadmin'">sysadmin</a>)</li></p>	<li>and hybrids of these (like <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/" target="_blank" title="The Web Standard Project uses a mnemonic acronym">WaSP</a>, <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/SIG.html" target="_blank" title="Jargon File definition of 'SIG'">SIGGRAPH</a>)</li></p></ul></p><p><p>&#8220;HTML&#8221; is none of these, rather it is an initialism, which <cite style="font-style: italic">Oxford</cite>&#8212;among many others&#8212;defines as an abbreviation that &#8220;consists of the initial letters of a series of words, pronounced in sequence.&#8221; Like acronyms, initialisms have word-like qualities, and can take affixes (<abbr title="Latin: 'for example'">e.g.</abbr>, pro-<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <a href="http://www.htmler.org/" target="_blank" title="&#60;HTML&#62;er.org">HTMLer</a>). </p></p><p><h2>How to use</h2></p><p>Despite these well-recognized definitions, there remains a lot of confusion as to what an acronym is (including <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/acronyms/#faq" target="_blank" title="The Acronym Database offers an incorrect definition of 'acronym'">some who should </a><a href="http://www.acronymsearch.com/view_topic.php?id=00001" target="_blank" title="The Acronym Search incorrectly answers 'What is an ACRONYM?'">know better</a>). On the Web, the blame can likely be traced to the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/text.html#edef-ACRONYM" target="_blank" title="W3C's HTML 4.01 Recommendation: 9.2.1 Phrase elements">troublesome acronym definition</a> (which was <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1997Jul/0558.html" target="_blank" title="www-html@w3.org from July 1997: &lt;acronym? [was: www-html archives ]">challenged</a> even before HTML 4.0 was recommended). Compounding the problem was Microsoft&#8217;s strange decision not to support the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/text.html#edef-ABBR" target="_blank" title="HTML 4.01 Recommendation: 9.2.1 Phrase elements"><code>abbr</code></a> element in its Windows-based browsers.</p> </p><p><p>As a result <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/day_17_defining_acronyms.html" target="_blank" title="Dive Into Accessibility: 'Day 17: Defining acronyms'">many developers</a> (including myself, for a time) use <code>acronym</code> in place of <code>abbr</code>. Unfortunately, this is exactly the <em>opposite thing</em> that should be done: when in doubt, wrap the abbreviation/acronym/initialism with <code>abbr</code>. Even if it <em>is</em> an acronym, the mark-up will be semantically correct.</p></p><p><h2>Styling</h2></p><p>Ironically, to ease the confusion over the W3C&#8217;s definition, a new style property, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/aural.html#propdef-speak" target="_blank" title="CSS2: 19.3 Speaking properties: 'speak'"><code>speak</code></a>, was created. Using it, an  acronym could can be styled with &#8220;<code>speak: normal</code>&#8221; while an initialism could use this: &#8220;<code>speak: spell-out</code>.&#8221;</p></p><p>Though <code>speak</code> is designed for aural browsers, Mozilla/Netscape 6+ also treat <code>abbr</code> and <code>acronym</code> differently by placing a one-pixel, dotted, black border under the abbreviation. Inspired by the look, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/practicalcss/" target="_blank" title="A List Apart: 'Practical CSS Layout Tips, Tricks and Techniques' (go to CSS Help)">many site authors</a> are now adding the following rule to their style sheets:</p></p><pre></p>ABBR, ACRONYM { border-bottom: 1px dotted #000; cursor: help; }</p></pre></p><p>(Internet Explorer on Windows will display <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted #000; cursor: help;">this style</span> as a one-pixel, dashed, black border under <code>acronym</code> but not  <code>abbr</code>.)</p></p><p><h2>When to use</h2></p><p>Another common question about using the <code>abbr</code> and <code>acronym</code> is how often to use them.  The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/#tech-expand-abbr" target="_blank" title="WCAG 1.0: Checkpoint 4.2">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines suggest</a> following the conventions of traditional written English and include the definition in the relevant element&#8217;s <code>title</code> when the definition first appears:</p></p><pre></p>&#60;p&#62;Dynamic &#60;abbr title="HyperText Markup Language"&#62;HTML&#60;/abbr&#62; is a mixture of HTML, &#60;abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"&#62;CSS&#60;/abbr&#62;, and JavaScript.&#60;/p&#62;</p></pre></p><p>Where the guidelines are unclear is on what to do after that initial reference. <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001OctDec/0679.html" target="_blank" title="w3c-wai-ig@w3.org from October to December 2001: RE: abbr/acron">Some suggest</a> wrapping the second definition with an element, without the <code>title</code>. The reasoning being that screen readers will see the following references as more than a collection of letters.</p></p><p>Whichever method is used, it should work today and continue to be future-proof.</p>
