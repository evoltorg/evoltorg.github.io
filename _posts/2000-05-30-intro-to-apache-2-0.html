<P></p>With the upcoming release of <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_2_0.html" target="_new">Apache 2.0</a>, the most popular web server on the Internet looks to extend its 60% marketshare with increased flexibility, portability, and performance.</p></P></p><P></p><a href="http://www.apachetoday.com" target="_new">Apache Today</a> has a <a href="http://apachetoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-05-28-004-01-PS" target="_new">nice column</a> that attempts to explain some of the new features and improvements in the forthcoming Apache 2.0 release.</p></P></p><P></p><i></p>"Perhaps the biggest change in Apache 2.0 is the Apache Portable Run-Time (APR). In</p>                      previous versions of Apache, portability for Apache was handled internally, which kept Apache</p>                      developers from doing what they really wanted, making the most popular web server. With</p>                      Apache 2.0, portability is handled by APR. APR is a project that is currently tied to Apache, but</p>                      should be spun off into its own project soon after the official 2.0 release. The goal of APR is to</p>                      provide a single C interface to platform- specific functions so that code can be written once and</p>                      compiled and run everywhere." </i></p></P>
