<P>\nWith the upcoming release of <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_2_0.html" target="_new">Apache 2.0</a>, the most popular web server on the Internet looks to extend its 60% marketshare with increased flexibility, portability, and performance.\n</P>\n<P>\n<a href="http://www.apachetoday.com" target="_new">Apache Today</a> has a <a href="http://apachetoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-05-28-004-01-PS" target="_new">nice column</a> that attempts to explain some of the new features and improvements in the forthcoming Apache 2.0 release.\n</P>\n<P>\n<i>\n"Perhaps the biggest change in Apache 2.0 is the Apache Portable Run-Time (APR). In\n                      previous versions of Apache, portability for Apache was handled internally, which kept Apache\n                      developers from doing what they really wanted, making the most popular web server. With\n                      Apache 2.0, portability is handled by APR. APR is a project that is currently tied to Apache, but\n                      should be spun off into its own project soon after the official 2.0 release. The goal of APR is to\n                      provide a single C interface to platform- specific functions so that code can be written once and\n                      compiled and run everywhere." </i>\n</P>
