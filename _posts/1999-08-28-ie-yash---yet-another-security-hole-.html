IE YASH (Yet Another Security Hole) <P>\nIf you run IE, check out\n<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2322425,00.html?chkpt=hpqs014">this article</a> at ZDNet\n.... <P>\nThis is about the ability of IE to run ActiveX 'applets' via raw HTML. IMHO -  M$ seems to think its OK for anonymous users to have full access to your system services without contraint. My problem is that people don't seem to care. <P>
