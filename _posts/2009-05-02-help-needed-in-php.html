Hello everybody,</p><p>I need some assistance about PHP. I am new to it, i just started like a week ago. I am using PHP and MySQL, I can connect to the database, i have created my login form and as this stage everything is perfect. Now after the login it leads me to a form to create a new user for example... but i want to add the system date in a field name Creation_date which will inform on when the record has been created. But how can i put the system date in a field on the form so when I click on the SUBMIT button the date can be stored in the database.</p><p>Thanks for your help, It might be very easy to do but that happened when you are just beginner.
