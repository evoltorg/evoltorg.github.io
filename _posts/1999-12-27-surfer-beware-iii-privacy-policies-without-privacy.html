<p>In this <a href="http://www.epic.org/reports/surfer-beware3.html" target="_new" title="Opens New Window">survey</a> the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) reviewed the privacy practices of the 100 most popular shopping websites on the Internet.</p></p><p><p>They found that 18 of the top shopping sites did not display a privacy policy, 35 of the sites have profile-based advertisers operating on their pages, and 86 of the e-commerce operations use cookies.</p></p><p><p>Not one of the companies adequately addressed all the elements of Fair Information Practices. In general they also found that the privacy policies available at many websites are typically confusing, incomplete, and inconsistent. Conclusion: The current practices of the online industry provide little meaningful privacy protection for consumers.</p></p><p><p>More of the <a href="http://www.epic.org/reports/surfer-beware3.html" target="_new" title="Opens New Window">survey</a> by Epic.</p>
