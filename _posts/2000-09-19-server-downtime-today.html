<p></p>The evolt.org website will be down beginning at 6:00pm CST today the 19th of Sep for some upgrades to the database.</p></p></p><p></p>We'll be dropping the DB server off line to stick another 512Mb of RAM into it to deal with some traffic spikes we've been getting lately. If anyone's interested, its a Dell 2300 Poweredge hooked to an external RAID5 array(not the best for DB's, but thats a different story :) with dual pentium II 450's and 1GB of RAM. It runs Oracle 8<em>i</em>(8.1.6) on Red Hat Linux 6.2. </p></p></p><p></p>If anyone has questions or knows where I can start picking up cheap hardware, <a href="mailto:djc@members.evolt.org">drop me a line!</a> - thanks for the understanding!</p></p>
