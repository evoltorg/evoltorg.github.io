<h2>Disclaimer</h2></p><p> Before I begin I am not even sure if this article is very relevant to many </p>  people accessing this site. Let me explain why, I gather that most people have </p>  access to high speed/steady connections, well this article would be more relevant </p>  to people not having the above, in some cases not even having access to the </p>  Internet. </p></p><h2>Introduction</h2></p><p> I am going to mention some ways to browse the Internet using just plain and </p>  simple e-mail.</p>  Why is this relevant to me?</p></p></p><ul></p>  <li>I live in a land of slow Internet connectivity... forget about Internet, I </p>    am freaking lucky if I am able to get a dial tone from my phone. </li></p>  <li>On a very sunny day, with blessings of all the holy men around, I would </p>    be really privileged to connect at 33.6 over a telephone line.</li></p>  <li>Did you mention cable modems? Dude, we don't have cable TV.</li></p></ul></p><h2>A Brief Digression</h2></p><p> I have this good lady friend who works for a relief organisation in southern </p>  Sudan. (I hope everybody knows where Sudan is, I know: they are my neighbours). </p></p></p><p>She </p>  is mostly in the field, and her organisation has provided fairly decent equipment. </p>  Their field office has some radio equipment, and my friend has some weird proprietary </p>  software that allows her to access email over a wireless radio. They have got </p>  this and a radio satellite phone that fits in a suitcase but is bloody expensive </p>  to use.</p></p></p><p></p>  This is about the only way they've got to communicate to the outside world. </p></p></p><p> My friend is from Swaziland, she sometimes has to be in the field for quite </p>  a long time, so she loses track of all the happenings, news, sports et al. in </p>  Swaziland -</p>  what's she to do now? </p></p><h2>The Web via Email</h2></p><p>As any decent friend would do (;-)) I offered to help her out. </p></p><p> If I send an email to: </p>  <a href="mailto:agora@dna.affrc.go.jp">agora@dna.affrc.go.jp</a></p>  with no subject, and this in the body of the email :</p></p>  <blockquote><code>SEND http://news.google.com/news?q=swaziland</code> </p></blockquote></p><p> After a while I receive this reply: </p></p><blockquote></p>  This mail is not a spam but the automatic reply to your mail;<br></p>  From: yourmail@yourmail.com<br></p>  To: agora@dna.affrc.go.jp<br></p>  Date: Mon, 1 Apr 2002 12:38:33 +0300<br></p>  ---------------------------</blockquote></p><p><p>After this I get the whole html results page from google news for the keyword: </p>  Swaziland in text form with all the hrefs below it, allowing me to make further </p>  requests if needed via email</p></p><p>What I had basically done was, send the <a href="http://news.google.com" target="_blank" </p>title="Launches google news in a new window">http://news.google.com</a> </p>  search string to a mail robot, which browsed then download, then emailed the </p>  page back to me.</p></p><p>What if I wanted not just a single page but also all the pages pointed to by </p>  that page?</p></p><p>No problem, the agora service has a command called DEEP.</p></p><p>For instance if I send: <code>DEEP http://www.cnn.com</code>, the service would send me the first page i.e. www.cnn.com and also all the </p>  content of the pages which link from cnn.com. There are quite a few powerful </p>  commands like this, which I will not go into. To get detailed info about all </p>  the agora services commands send an email to <a href="mailto:agora@dna.affrc.go.jp">agora@dna.affrc.go.jp</a>, with WWW </p>  in the body of the email.</p></p><h2>Other services </h2></p><p>My good lady friend used agora for a while, but she found a page referring </p>  to a pdf document on a web page that she wanted to see very much. Again she </p>  looked to me for help.</p></p><h3>The www4mail Service</h3></p><p>If I send an email to: <a href="mailto:www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it">www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it</a></strong> </p>  with this in the body: </p></p><blockquote> <code>http://www.undp.org/dpa/publications/xyz.pdf</code></blockquote></p>  After a while I receive the file xyz.pdf back as a file by email. </p></p><p>This service also sends back HTML files, if I sent the same google news search </p>  URL to the www4mail service, it sends me back the search results page as an </p>  HTML file.</p></p><h2>FTP via email </h2></p><p>There used be quite a few services available around a year ago, especially </p>  one called BITFTP, sadly most of them seem to have met their demise, and I </p>  couldn't find any working services. </p></p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p><p>So my friend is happy, which means I am happy, and on this pleasant note, let </p>  me finish.</p></p><p>I have provided links to some sites, which provide information on these offline </p>  services. The service locations that I mentioned above are not the only ones </p>  in existence. These services are free, there are also some services which do </p>  this for $$$$, I didn't mention them. The response time for some these services </p>  is not instant (takes a few hours sometimes), and sometimes they do not work </p>  at all. So use them wisely.</p></p><h2>Related sites</h2></p><ul></p><li> <a href="http://www4mail.org/" target="_blank" title="launches external site">www4mail </p>  service home page &amp; user manual</a>.
