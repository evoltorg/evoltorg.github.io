After months of beta testing, Allaire shipped Spectra this week. Spectra is possibly the most affordable industrial strength content management &amp; eCommerce system for large websites, and is based on the ColdFusion tool Allaire built to manage their own site. <P>\nAllaire are offering a startup bundle of servers, tools, training, consulting and support for $117,445 (#72,300) - not bad considering BroadVision (probably the biggest competitor) costs around that for license fees for a single server, and tell you not to expect much change out of $1.6m (#1m) for a similar bundle. <P>\nMore <a href='http://www.allaire.com/products/spectra/' target='_blank' title='Spectra home page'>information on Spectra</a>, and the <a href='http://www.allaire.com/handlers/index.cfm?ID=13394&Method=Full' target='_blank'>press release</a>, are available from the Allaire site. <P>
