<p>Now that the world has been enriched by both <strong>Netscape 7 Preview Release</strong> and</p><strong>Mozilla 1.0 Final</strong>,</p>many people have lost track of all Netzilla/Moscape releases.</p>The naming and versioning system (if any) is completely</p>incomprehensible and becomes stranger with each new name and release. Personally</p>I feel that this confusion is a deliberate policy of both the</p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org"</p>	target="_blank">Mozilla project</a> and</p><a href="http://home.netscape.com/company/?cp=hop08fc7" target="_blank"</p>	title="NCC corporate info">Netscape Communications Corporation</a>,</p>since both are very consistent in their inconsistency.</p></p><p><p>So it's time for an overview. What are the names of the various tries to produce a viable Netscape</p>browser? Do these names mean anything?</p></p><p><h2>Netscape 5</h2></p><p><p>In 1998, Netscape released the source code of its (then still popular) Netscape 4 browser. The goal</p>was to make the production of the new Netscape 5 browser an open source project, involving thousands</p>of programmers from all over the world.</p></p><p><p>Pretty soon, the</p>project decided to start all over again: the old Netscape 4 code engine was too complex and couldn't form</p>a stable basis for a new Netscape release (in fact, it didn't form a stable basis for Netscape 4</p>either).</p></p><p><p>So a new browser would be written.</p>Eventually this brave new browser would become <b>Netscape 5</b>. So far so good.</p></p><p><h2>Mozilla</h2></p><p><p>From the earliest days of the Netscape browser, the code engine that actually took care of interpreting</p>HTML, (later) JavaScript and (still later) CSS was called <b>Mozilla</b>. This strange name started out</p>as a combination of <em>Mo</em>saic and God<em>zilla</em>. The message was supposed to be that this</p>new code engine would sweep  goold old Mosaic away, as Godzilla swept away King Kong. Something like</p>that, anyway.</p></p><p><p>Netscape 1 ran Mozilla 1, 2 ran 2, 3 ran 3 and Netscape 4 ran Mozilla 4. Remember that back in those</p>days a new version number actually meant something: each new Netscape version could do far more than</p>its predecessor.</p></p><p><p>Almost every browser identification string still starts with the name <em>Mozilla</em>,</p>even those of non-Netscape browsers. The reasons behind this are</p><a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~ppk/js/index.html?detect.html#string"</p>	target="_blank" title="An explanation of the use of the name 'Mozilla' in non-Netscape browsers."</p>	>another story</a>.</p></p><p><p>When the project to write a new Netscape code engine started, it was named</p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org"</p>	target="_blank">The Mozilla Project</a>. One would expect the goal of this project was to</p>produce <strong>Mozilla 5</strong>, being the fifth version of the Netscape code engine.</p></p><p><h2>Gecko</h2></p><p><p>Not so. In the beginning each code engine release was named <b>Gecko</b> for reasons I've</p>forgotten. (Well, a gecko is a lizard and a godzilla is, too, so there might be some obscure point in giving it</p>this name.) To this name was added an <strong>M</strong> for <em>Milestone</em> and a version number. So the Mozilla</p>project delivered Gecko M1, then Gecko M2 and so on.</p></p><p><p>From the very earliest releases, the browser identification string started with <em>Mozilla/5.0</em>,</p>indicating that the browser would eventually become Netscape 5.</p></p><p><p>So eventually Mozilla 5 would form the core of Netscape 5, and until that time web developers would</p>be entertained by the various Gecko releases, numbering their Milestones from 1 onwards</p>until the Nirvana of standards-compatible browsing would be reached.</p>So far so good (well, OK-ish).</p></p><p><h2>Netscape 6</h2></p><p><p>Not so. The project took too bloody long. Microsoft had had a working Version 5 browser</p>almost since the start of the Mozilla project, which would mean that the new Netscape 5 would be seen</p>as a laggard, appearing on the scene while Microsoft already prepared its Version 6 browser.</p></p><p><p>So, unbeknownst to us web developers, marketing geniuses inside Netscape (or its corporate owner</p>AOL) decided the new Netscape would be Version 6. So when, on 14 November 2000, a preview</p>based on Gecko M18 was released, it was proudly named <b>Netscape 6.0 Preview Release</b>. So Netscape</p>has <em>altogether skipped Version 5</em>.</p></p><p><p>Nonetheless the browser identification string still proclaimed it to be <em>Mozilla/5.0</em>,</p>in keeping with the old Netscape tradition. So technically it was a Version  5 browser, marketing-wise</p>it was a Version 6 browser.</p></p><p><p>Keeping track of the names started to get confusing, but it could be managed.</p></p><p><h2>Mozilla 1.0</h2></p><p><p>Therefore the Mozilla Project decided the situation wasn't vague enough. When Netscape 6.0, based</p>on Gecko M18, had been released, the Gecko name was altogether dropped. Instead, the new goal of the</p>project became the production of <strong>Mozilla 1.0</strong>.</p></p><p><p>One wonders why the new code engine wasn't named <strong>Mozilla 5.0</strong>, the only name that actually</p>makes sense: the fifth version of the Mozilla code engine.</p></p><p><p>But the Mozilla Project was not to be denied.</p>In quick succession Mozilla 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.8.1, 0.9, 0.9.1, 0.9.7, 0.9.8, and 0.9.9 were released.</p>The Project was working towards 1.0, no doubt about it.</p></p><p><p>Then, when everyone expected Mozilla 1.0, the Project came with a new subtlety: Release Candidates.</p>Mozilla 1.0 Release Candidate 1, Mozilla 1.0 RC 2 and Mozilla 1.0 RC 3 were released. Personally I'd</p>expected even more confusion, culminating in something like Mozilla 1.0 Release Candidate 2.1 beta 3,</p>but the Project has unexpectedly become sensible and given us <strong>Mozilla 1.0 Final</strong>.</p></p><p><h2>Mozilla 1.0.3 Preliminary Review 3.5a ?</h2></p><p><p>This latest release in fact seems to be a pretty good browser (though I've only done some preliminary</p>tests). So the Mozilla Project has done what it has promised so many years ago. Cause for celebration,</p>certainly, but personally I don't feel like it at all: I'm too confused.</p></p><p><p>The Project has already announced Mozilla 1.1, which makes sense, but I'm afraid we'll have to</p>deal with Mozilla 1.0.3 Preliminary Review 3.5a and such arcana first. Then again, I might be wrong</p>(in fact, I hope I'm wrong).</p></p><p><p>Of course the browser identification string still starts with <em>Mozilla/5.0</em>, and not <em>Mozilla/1.0</em>,</p>which would cause people to confuse it with ancient Netscape 1. To make it even more complex, <em>Gecko</em></p>is also mentioned in the string. I don't know what all this means. Just nod wisely and pretend it's completely</p>logical.</p></p><p><h2>Netscape 7</h2></p><p><p>So from Mozilla 0.6 onwards it was clear where the Mozilla Project was heading. Therefore fresh</p>confusion initiatives had to come from Netscape, or rather from its corporate owner AOL.</p></p><p><p>It succeeded admirably. The latest Netscape release is not Netscape 6.3 but <strong>Netscape 7.0</p>Preview Release</strong>. So the browser version number has once again been raised. Why?</p></p><p><p>Rumour has it that AOL is considering the use of the Netscape browser in its newest AOL 7. This</p>rumour may be true, it may also be another ritual move in the eternal dance of Microsoft and AOL, a</p>threat that might cause Microsoft to make some concessions. No way to tell. Fact is that AOL subsidiary</p>Compuserve does use a modern Netscape as its browser (I forgot which version exactly).</p></p><p><p>In any case, to make sure its users understand what's going on, AOL has decided on the combination</p>AOL 7-Netscape 7. Not the worst of ideas, from a corporate point of view. The suffering of web developers</p>trying to keep track of the various versions is less important, of course.</p></p><p><h2>What's next?</h2></p><p><p>I have no idea what will come next. I'm reasonably sure a browser named <b>Netscape 7</b>, based on</p>the <strong>Mozilla 1.0</strong> code engine will be released fairly soon. This will be a Version 5 browser</p>(hence <em>Mozilla/5.0</em> in its identification string).</p>It might even be that AOL will start using this browser in its own setup.</p></p><p><p>As you see version numbers have become completely void of all meaning. Where, up until Explorer 5,</p>you could be reasonably sure a new version number meant the support of exciting new technologies,</p>nowadays it means no such thing.</p></p><p><p>The past cause of events has shown both Netscape and the Mozilla project are completely unreliable and</p>unpredictable in the assignment of names and version numbers. So the situation will continue to be confusing</p>and I suppose I'll write an addendum to this article in half a year.</p>
