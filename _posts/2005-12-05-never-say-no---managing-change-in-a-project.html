excerpt: "In most projects, clients ask for changes to the requirements. Saying <q>No</q> is hard, and not always useful. Read on to discover how to avoid problems."

<p></p>	So, your project is up and running. You've defined </p>	<a href="/article/Introducing_Project_Requirements/20/60393/index.html">Project</p>	Requirements</a> and had them signed off in blood by the sponsor. All you need to</p>	do now is watch your </p>	<a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/new_model_army.htm">New Model Army</a> get on and deliver.</p>	Right? Ahhh no. Life is never that simple, and you can reasonably safely bet</p>	hard currency that the requirements <em>will</em> change during delivery. Managing</p>	those changes is a potential cause of massive disruption to your project</p>	and your relationship with the client if you don't do it well.</p></p></p><p><h2>Never Say <q>No</q> To a Client</h2></p><h3>Change is Bad</h3></p><p><p></p>	It's often said that Salespeople never say <q>No</q>. And it's often true - </p>	whatever the customer asks for, they invariably say <q>Yes, we can do that.</q></p>	And Project Managers generally hate that as it paints us into a corner where</p>	our projects are not under our control. Some </p>	<acronym title="Project Manager">PM</acronym>s therefore retreat into a</p>	<a href="http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0120915/quotes">Yoda-like mantra</a>:</p></p></p><ul></p>	<li>Saying Yes leads to Change</li></p>	<li>Change leads to Lack of Control</li></p>	<li>Lack of control leads to <em>Suffering</em> (which is a PM technical term</p>	for missing deadlines, budgets or quality objectives)</li></p></ul></p><p></p>	But as a client-facing PM, you soon learn that to say <q>No</q> is just </p>	unacceptable to most clients. It's seen as pure stonewalling; that you're </p>	not prepared to be cooperative, or (worse) that your team just isn't </p>	competent. Either can cause you serious problems in your sponsor relationship,</p>	maintaining which is one of your top priorities. </p></p></p><h3>Change is Good</h3>	</p><p>	</p>	On the other hand, saying</p>	<q>Yes</q> to client requests tends to result in more work. In the other</p>	Yoda mantra:</p></p></p><ul></p>	<li>Saying Yes leads to Change</li></p>	<li>Change leads to More Work</li></p>	<li>More Work leads to <em>Happiness</em> (another PM technical term for </p>	Increased Project Revenue and Gross Profit, which you're often responsible </p>	for)</li></p></ul></p><p><h3>Balance - a Neat Trick</h3></p><p></p>	Balancing between stonewalling (pretending that nothing can be changed and </p>	rejecting all proposed changes) and accepting all proposed changes and causing</p>	major project control problems is a tough act. Trying to work it</p>	out mid-project is even tougher. Trying to work it out on the hoof is nigh</p>	on impossible. Here's the basic magic formula - if you take nothing else</p>	away from this article, take the following sentence. Put it in your wallet,</p>	stick it to your monitor, brand it on the back of your hand:</p></p></p><blockquote></p>	Your request makes sense, but it raises potential risks and issues that </p>	might cost time and money.</p></blockquote></p><p><p></p>	Use The Sentence even if the client request <em>doesn't</em> make sense.</p>	Some requests will, some won't, but The Sentence usually ends up with</p>	one of 2 results: </p></p></p><ol></p>	<li>Client backs off</li></p>	<li>Client agrees to more time, more money or lower quality</li></p></ol></p><p></p>	In either case, it's a useful holding action that then lets you wheel out</p>	the Change Control Process that you thoughtfully included in your standard</p>	statement of work.</p></p></p><p><h2>Change Control Process</h2></p><p><p></p>	This is a process to consistently handle the inevitable Change Requests</p>	that crop up mid-project, ensuring that the good ones get through, with</p>	associated adjustments to the cost/time/quality Holy Trinity, but the</p>	bad ones don't. You maintain control of your project, you're contractually</p>	covered, the client gets what they want, but pays for it if necessary.</p><p></p></p><p><h3>What is a Change Request?</h3></p><p></p>	This one's easy: A Change Request is any request that changes the </p>	<a href="/article/Introducing_Project_Requirements/20/60393/index.html">Project Requirements</a>.</p><p></p></p><p><h3>Do We Need a Change Control Process?</h3></p><p></p>	Again, easy. Yes. <strong>Every project <em>must</em> have a change</p>	process. Every change request <em>must</em> use it.</strong></p></p></p><p></p>	Time and time again, I've heard inexperienced clients, developers and</p>	sales people starting to say things like: <q>This project is too small/rapid/</p>	low-budget to have a change process.</q> or <q>This change is too small to go through</p>	change control.</q> To which I invariably respond: <q>Only</p>	if the project policy is to refuse all change requests</q> - which is of course</p>	a change process, just a <em>really</em> simple one to operate - <q>or find</p>	yourselves another PM.</q></p></p></p><p><p></p>	Strict? Yes. But here's why: because Project Requirements are a contractual </p>	document, any change to Requirements</p>	is also a contractual document. If the appropriate project authorities (the</p>	Sponsor and you) haven't signed up to a Change to the Requirements, you</p>	will fail <a href="/article/The_Tao_of_Testing/20/4142/index.html#uat"><abbr title="User Acceptance Testing">UAT</abbr></a>,</p>	your project won't be accepted by the sponsor, and there's a good chance</p>	you won't be paid.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	Here's an example: a stakeholder has a wizard wheeze. It's a pretty simple </p>	change to the requirements and won't take much</p>	effort to implement. Realising this, the stakeholder takes it straight to one</p>	of the developers, who codes it up and tests it in a couple of hours. Doesn't</p>	break anything else, doesn't noticeably impact timescales or budgets. But</p>	come UAT, the Sponsor notes that the delivered site doesn't match the</p>	requirements, and rightly asks <q>Where did I agree to this?</q> You</p>	<em>cannot</em> allow your project to get to that point, because the only</p>	honest answer is <q>You didn't</q> with the enevitable followups of <q>When</p>	did <em>you</em> agree to it?</q> and <q>Who died and gave you authority over</p>	what <em>I</em> want.</q> That's A Bad Place to be.</p></p></p><p><p></p>	You don't need to follow the <em>same</em> process for small <acronym title="Change Request">CR</acronym>s</p>	as large ones, though. You can use a light weight process for small CRs, as </p>	long as the 2 processes are documented and agreed, including - vitally - </p>	the definition of a small CR.</p></p></p><p><h3>Sample Change Control Process</h3></p><p><p></p>	Here's an example of a simple Change Control Process. It's not the only possible</p>	process you could use, but it is in line with most <a href="http://www.pmi.org/info/default.asp"><abbr title="Project Management Institute">PMI</abbr></a>-</p>	compliant methodologies, so would be generally accepted by most professionally</p>	run projects.</p></p></p><p></p><img src="/files/change_control_process.png" style="float: right" /></p></p></p><ol></p>	<li><strong>Someone submits a CR.</strong> You need to agree and document who</p>	is able to do this.</li></p>	<li><strong>Assess the CR to see if it's worth investigating</strong>. Here,</p>	you need to work out how long it's going to take to analyse the impact of</p>	the CR, and compare that with the projected benefits. This is a quick preflight</p>	check to weed out the obvious non-starters. If it's going to take</p>	a week just to work out how much change is involved, and the benefit is</p>	tiny, or there's not a hope in hell of it being accepted (for example, it</p>	changes the objective of the project) then this gets thrown in the bucket </p>	of <q>CRs that are a waste of time from the outset</q>.</li></p>	<li><strong>Document and Communicate.</strong> Essential for all outcomes</p>	of any process.</li></p>	<li><strong>Analyse the impact.</strong> Answers the questions: <q>If we</p>	implement the change, how is it going to hit the Holy Trinity? What's the</p>	Risk?</q> </p>	<p>To do this,</p>	you will possibly need to replan a large chunk of the project - schedules,</p>	<acronym title="Work Breakdown Structure">WBS</acronym>, staffing, budgets and all. You may need time from developers for them</p>	to contribute - time they would otherwise spend delivering the project.</p></p>	<p>You <em>must</em> have allowed for this in your original budget and schedule,</p>	and have it explicitly written into your contract. Avoiding doing this</p>	unnecessarily is why you had the pre-assessment in step 2.</p></li></p>	<li><strong>Document and Communicate</strong></li></p>	<li><strong>Approve the CR?</strong> This is where you take your assessment</p>	and put it in front of your sponsor. It's then <em>the sponsor</em> who</p>	decides whether the CR should go ahead, accepting the changes in Schedule,</p>	Cost, Quality and Risk. If the sponsor decides against the CR, you've</p>	been co-operative and (I hope) objective in putting it forward, and you're</p>	not the one saying <q>No</q>.</li></p>	<li><strong>Document and Communicate</strong></li></p>	<li><strong>Document and Communicate</strong></li></p>	<li><strong>Implement Change</strong></li></p></ol></p><p>Which is where your developers think the <em>real</em> work starts.</p>
