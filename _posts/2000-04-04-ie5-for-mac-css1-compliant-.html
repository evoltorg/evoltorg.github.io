user_biog: "<p>Martin Burns has been doing this stuff since <a href=\"http://news.com.com/Netscape+bowed%2C+but+not+broken/2100-1032_3-5406682.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netscape 1.0</a> days. Starting with the communication ends that online media support, he moved back through design, HTML and server-side code. Then he got into running the whole show.
These days he\'s working for <a href=\"http://www-5.ibm.com/services/uk/services/bcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these people</a> as a Project Manager, and still thinks (nearly 6 years on) it\'s a hell of a lot better than working for a dot-com. In his Copious Free Time&trade;, he helps out running a <a href=\"http://www.purpur.co.uk/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloth Nappies</a> online store.

<p>Amongst his favourite things is <del><strike><a href=\"http://www.zope.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">Zope</a></strike></del><ins><a href=\"http://drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal</a></ins>, which he uses to run his <a href=\"http://www.easyweb.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">personal site</a>. He\'s starting to (re)gain a sneaking regard for ECMAscript since the arrival of unobtrusive scripting.</p> 

<p>He\'s been a member of evolt.org since the very early days, a board member, a president, a writer and even contributed a modest amount of template code for the current site. Above all, he likes evolt.org to do things because it knowingly chooses to do so, rather than randomly stumbling into them. He\'s also one of the boys and girls who beervolts in the UK, although the arrival of small children in his life have knocked the frequency for 6.</p>

After some extensive testing, I can report that ie5 for Mac appears to be Microsoft's first CSS1 compliant browser.</p>                                                                                        </p>Using <a href='http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/' target='_new'>W3C's CSS Test Suite</a>, the only property in the CSS standard not supported by ie5 is <code>text decoration: blink</code>, which is not only ugly as sin, but a non-mandatory property.</p><p>ie5 for Mac even passed the <a href='http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current/sec5526c.htm' target='_new'>CSS Acid Test</a>, which <a href='http://browsers.evolt.org/index.cfm/dir/ie/32bit/5.0/' title='*cough*'>previous standards compliant MS browsers</a> failed.</p><p>However, <a href='http://www.westciv.com/style_master/academy/browser_support/IE_support/IE5Mac.html' target='_new'>House of Style reports that there are still bugs in the support</a> of the vertical-align text property and some of the inline elements.</p><p>I also notice that as ie5 uses a highlight box for active links, rather than the ALINK colour, this could also be seen to be broken.</p><p>Finally, as previously commented on evolt, MS have seen fit to break the 72dpi screen resolution standard on Macs, just as they have previously for all Windows applications. While it is resettable via user preferences, it is still a regrettable backward move portrayed as progress.
