<p>The gods of usability, the <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/worldtour/" title="Wow, their site has images!">Nielsen Norman Group</a>, are currently on a world tour. Is it worth attending?           Well, it's expensive, so that'll depend on who's paying...</p><p><h3>Conclusions</h3></p><p><ul>\n<li>If you have to pay yourself it's probably not worth the expense. You may be better off finding alternative sources of information on the Web.</li>\n<li>If your company is paying, then go for it.</li>\n<li>If you have to choose between a course or the main event go to a course.</li>\n<li>Jakob Nielsen has got some impressive body language going...</li>\n</ul></p><p><h3>Main day</h3>\n<p>Very entertaining; Jakob Nielsen was surprisingly interesting. Tog was less interesting for me, Brenda�s bit was alright (think Captain Janeway) and Donald Norman�s presentation was disappointing since he wasn�t there and we got to see a video.</p></p><p><h3>Review of the courses</h3></p><p><ul>\n<li><p><b>Advanced Usability Testing Methodology</b><br>\nEveryone thought it wasn�t detailed enough, but it definitely made me a better usability professional. Worth it. I concluded that all Web sites of any complexity have thousands of little usability problems. Focus on the main ones. Lots of good tips to do testing. Also, train your designers / programmers in usability! That will improve the product a lot more than testing.</p></li></p><p><li><p><b>Introduction to Web Usability Testing</b><br>\nOnly for beginners.</p></li></p><p><li><p><b>E-Commerce Usability</b><br>\nBetter to go to the advanced usability course.</p></li></p><p><li><p><b>E-Marketing for Non-Marketers</b><br>\nVery good if you�re into this stuff.</p></li></p><p><li><p><b>The Art & Science of Web Design</b><br>\nGood overview, touching on IA issues and lots of related stuff. If you�re into this stuff you already know all this. Also sections on stylesheets and different browsers and such which may be less relevant to you. Very good for a general overview of the state of the art things to know if you�re in webdesign.</p></li></p><p><li><p><b>Content Design & Usability-Writing for the Web</b><br>\nDidn't catch this one. If anyone else did, please add a comment to this article.</p></li></p><p><li><p><b>Designing Usable Web Forms</b><br>\nDidn't catch this one either.</p></li>\n</ul></p><p><h3>Discussion</h3>\n<p>In addition to commenting on this page, you can also participate in a discussion on <a href="http://www.poorbuthappy.com/usability/talk11.html" title="Review of the NN world Tour in London">my site</a>.
