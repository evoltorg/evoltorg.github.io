<p>NeuStar has been selected by the US Department of Commerce to manage the .us domain space. They actually assumed operational control on <a href="http://www.neustar.com/pressroom/announcements/press_release.cfm?press_id=172" target="_blank" title="This link will open in new window">20 November 2001</a>, and expect to offer domains for sale in the next six months.</p></p><p><p>This will change two of the most notable things about the .us TLD. Those domains have always been free to certain groups (non-profits, local governments, etc.), but were assigned geographically, so that your state and locality were required to be part of the domain. (For example I live in Anchorage, Alaska, so that any domain that I wanted would have been domainname.anchorage.ak.us. Doesn't exactly role off the tongue, does it?) Now, you will be able to register anything.us, regardless of locality.</p></p><p><p>The second change is that they will now cost money. There is no indication of how much money other than a none-too-specific quote on NeuStar's site: "Market-based retail prices for dot-US domain names will be established by dot-US accredited Registrars and their resale channel partners. The pricing structure will be an annual subscription fee with multi-year subscriptions available." So probably anywhere from $12 to $35 per year.</p></p><p><p>Registration is expected to begin in mid-2002.</p></p><p><p>More information (all links will open in new windows):</p></p><ul></p><li><a href="http://www.nic.us/" target="_blank" title="This link will open in new window">.us</a> -- The official site for .us information.<br><br></li></p><li><a href="http://www.neustar.com/" target="_blank" title="This link will open in new window">NeuStar</a> -- NeuStar's site<br><br></li></p><li><a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/usca/cafiles/neuindex.htm" target="_blank" title="This link will open in new window">NeuStar's complete proposal for managing the usTLD</a></li></p></ul>
