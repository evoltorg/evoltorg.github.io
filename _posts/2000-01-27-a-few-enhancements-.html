I've come up with a few possible things that could make Evolt even better and provide more use to all of us.</p><p>-the ability to easily unsubscribe/subscribe to thelist via a checkbox in the user's registration page</p><p>-in the archives page to see a list of the recent postings for the day, categorized by subject/replies and than have the ability to be able to respond online to any of these articles if the user is currently unsubscribed to the list but a member of evolt</p><p>-the ability to post to thelist online in the archives it they are currently unsubscribed to the list</p><p>I know the last 2 suggestions could be difficult and not too feasible at the momemt. But hopefully some consideration will be give to it and possibly allow this to work in the future. I know the last 2 would help out a lot of us, especially when we need to limit incoming emails but still want to be active on the list.
