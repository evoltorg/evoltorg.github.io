The Australian based <a href="http://www.looksmart.com">LookSmart</a> directory is one of the few human edited web directories these days, and they have plans to take on its largest competitor <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a>. <P> </p>Read all about their plans over in <a href="http://www.andovernews.com/cgi-bin/news_story.pl?22340/InternetWatch">this article</a> at Andover.<P></p>I personally think that Yahoo needs a kick in the pants and some competition. Maybe then they'll remember that it was their outstanding directory service that got them to the top. When was the last time an outdated link on the Yahoo directory was updated in under a fortnight?
