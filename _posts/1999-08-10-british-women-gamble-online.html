Starting with the communication ends that online media support, he moved back through design, HTML and server-side code. Then he got into running the whole show.
These days he's working for <a href=\"http://www-5.ibm.com/services/uk/services/bcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these people</a> as a Project Manager, and still thinks (nearly 6 years on) it's a hell of a lot better than working for a dot-com. In his Copious Free Time&trade;, he helps out running a <a href=\"http://www.purpur.co.uk/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloth Nappies</a> online store.

<p>Amongst his favourite things is <del><strike><a href=\"http://www.zope.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">Zope</a></strike></del><ins><a href=\"http://drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal</a></ins>, which he uses to run his <a href=\"http://www.easyweb.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">personal site</a>. He's starting to (re)gain a sneaking regard for ECMAscript since the arrival of unobtrusive scripting.</p> 

<p>He's been a member of evolt.org since the very early days, a board member, a president, a writer and even contributed a modest amount of template code for the current site. Above all, he likes evolt.org to do things because it knowingly chooses to do so, rather than randomly stumbling into them. He's also one of the boys and girls who beervolts in the UK, although the arrival of small children in his life have knocked the frequency for 6.</p>

In the first UK survey on gambling, <a href='http://www.mori.com'>MORI</a> have found that women find gambling online far more attractive than gambling in traditional British gambling establishments.
