Netscape has released Preview Release version 3 of its long-awaited Netscape 6 browser.</p><p>Having just installed it and given it a quick once-over, I have a few preliminary observations:            </p><p><ul>\n<li>The most obvious change from PR2 is the updated skin or &quot;theme&quot;. The old &quot;Modern&quot; theme -- which produced a chorus of howls for its excess plainness -- is out. Netscape now sports a more three-dimensional, blue-chrome design.</li>\n<li>PR3 is based on the Mozilla Milestone 18 nightly build from 29 September, rather than the latest formally released M17 build.</li>\n<li>As with PR2, PR3 offers an interesting selection of language choices, only moreso: German, French, and Japanese versions of <strong>English</strong>, and both Japanese and US versions of <strong>Japanese</strong>. Since there was no English English,US English, or UK English from which to choose, I settled on the German English, and so far it seems pretty Englisch to me.</li>\n<li>The image-swap problems of M17 seem to have been fixed, although occassional artifacts do mar some rollovers</li>\n<li>The Sun Java plug-in, though installed, doesn't seem to be working</li>\n<li>Interestingly, the CSS :hover pseudo-class is broken -- a feature that has worked reasonably well for several Mozilla builds</li>\n<li>The annoying and standards-defiant practice of displaying the &lt;table&gt; &quot;summary&quot; attribute as a tool-tip has been eliminated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All-in-all, Netscape 6 PR3 appears to be a somewhat more stable browser than PR2, although a number of rough edges still remain.</p></p><p><!--</p><p><p>Links to the <strong>full</strong> downloads of PR3:</p>\n<ul><li><a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6_PR3/mac/macos8.5/sea/MacNS6FullInstaller.sea.bin" target="_foo" title="Opens in new window">Mac</a></li>\n<li><a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6_PR3/unix/linux22/sea/netscape-i686-pc-linux-gnu-sea.tar.gz" target="_foo" title="Opens in new window">Linux</a></li>\n<li><a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6_PR3/windows/win32/sea/N6Setup.exe" target="_foo" title="Opens in new window">Win32</a></li></ul></p><p>-->
