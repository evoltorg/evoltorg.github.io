<p>Have you ever said to yourself &quot;this is stupid&quot; while reading long </p>  text on your computer screen? We all know that it's not the best way to read, </p>  but what else can we do?</p></p><p>Today we receieved an invitation to comment and join the efforts of a team </p>  that's trying to solve this problem.</p></p><blockquote></p>  <p>The <a href="http://www.lexiaproject.org/" target="_blank">lexiaProject</a> Public GUI </p>    Initiative is a collaborative Open Content License project to create a better </p>    graphical user interface (GUI) for reading extended texts on a computer screen. </p>    The project uses a new technique, called vertical serial text presentation </p>    (VSTP) in combination with a unique interface widget to accommodate rapid, </p>    hands-free reading. </blockquote></p>  </p><p>(The java demo is the most accurate). <br></p>  It still needs some corrections - they enumerate the bugs in the site - and </p>  there's also a lot of user practice to get used to it. </p></p><p>I wonder how we're going to be able to implement &quot;webbing&quot; the interface, and </p>  sending web content into it, I hope they have some lean kind of anwser.</p></p><p>The invitation is open to coment about it in our site.</p></p>
