<p>Have you ever said to yourself &quot;this is stupid&quot; while reading long \n  text on your computer screen? We all know that it's not the best way to read, \n  but what else can we do?</p>\n<p>Today we receieved an invitation to comment and join the efforts of a team \n  that's trying to solve this problem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <a href="http://www.lexiaproject.org/" target="_blank">lexiaProject</a> Public GUI \n    Initiative is a collaborative Open Content License project to create a better \n    graphical user interface (GUI) for reading extended texts on a computer screen. \n    The project uses a new technique, called vertical serial text presentation \n    (VSTP) in combination with a unique interface widget to accommodate rapid, \n    hands-free reading. </blockquote>\n  \n<p>(The java demo is the most accurate). <br>\n  It still needs some corrections - they enumerate the bugs in the site - and \n  there's also a lot of user practice to get used to it. </p>\n<p>I wonder how we're going to be able to implement &quot;webbing&quot; the interface, and \n  sending web content into it, I hope they have some lean kind of anwser.</p>\n<p>The invitation is open to coment about it in our site.</p>\n
