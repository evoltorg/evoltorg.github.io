Job Title: Lead Scientific Programmer/Analyst<br /></p>Company Name: Science Systems and Applications, Inc.<br /></p>Location: Suitland, MD<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>SSAI seeks a Lead Programmer/Analyst to provide science and software support to the NOAA Environmental Satellite Processing Center applications specifically for non-NOAA applications. Applications include several based on date from NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) missions such as MODIS, AMSR-E and Jason-2.  The ideal candidate will have experience with operational processing of EOS data from Level 0 to Level 3. The candidate will perform full life-cycle system/software engineering support for software applications written in FORTRAN and C for Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) for global, long-term forecasting and environmental monitoring, ingest/decode multi-satellite sensor systems and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) for meteorological product processing systems which use COTS software (McIDAS and IDL) to process weather satellite imagery, model data, and family of services data for product distribution to NOAA customers for use in weather analysis. <br /><br /></p><p>The candidate will program, modify, debug, integrate, and test applications which process and distribute NOAA weather data in a 24x7 operational environment. Key tasks include providing immediate code fixes for problems impacting product delivery/quality in real-time, as well as problem solving to isolate and correct root causes that impact system performance over time. Develop, implement and maintain product enhancements using Software Development Life Cycle as required by the customer. The candidate will identify and communicate technical problems, processes and solutions and must be prepared to convert science level software into code capable of running in a production environment, including software design, engineering, and debugging.
