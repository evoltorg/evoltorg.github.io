<p>My name is the head lemur and I am a recovering Source Code Thief!</p></p><p><p>I started in 1994 with my first internet connection. Netscape and</p>Internet Explorer  gave me the ability to peek behind the scenes. I</p>thought that View Source would take me to the First Page of the</p>Internet. It didn't.</p></p><p><p>Instead it revealed your code. All those weird characters that weren't</p>on the page suddenly appeared on my computer screen. I thought that I</p>had made a mistake, and when I went to close the Window it asked me if I</p>would like to Save It. I am weak. I said Yes.</p></p><p><p>I couldn't help myself. I binged. I spent hours, days, even weeks,</p>stealing code. I began to study this HTML stuff. I stole more. My code</p>stealing habit got so bad that I had to spend 400 dollars on a 40MB</p>harddrive to have a place to keep it. I plundered, pillaged and looted.</p>I stole entire sites and saved them on floppies. You could then.</p></p><p><p>Your code was mine. Then I discovered that I could take your images too.</p>With the images the code began to make sense. I saw nothing wrong. It</p>was there, I was here and all I needed to do was to save it. I saw the</p>same images appearing on all sorts of different sites. I felt no guilt.</p></p><p><p>Now I could push the code around and see what happened. It began to make</p>sense. The things that worked, the things that didn't. I discovered</p>entire websites that people built to give away free images, code</p>secrets, and links to sites that were giving away even more stuff.</p></p><p><p>I discovered a shareware HTML code editor. I stole that too.</p>I began to build webpages.  It was orgasmic. I had the power to create</p>my own worlds. I could make big letters, I could make letters flow</p>around pictures. I became enraptured with the power of a few simple</p>tags. I stole, I coded, I stole.</p></p><p><p>I joined the HTML Writers Guild. I lurked, I saved, I stole. I stole the</p>tips you gave me and hid them in my work. I built more pages. I</p>discovered that I could put my pages on the web. I did. I stole my first</p>FTP program. My theft knew no bounds. I began to learn about where the</p>HTML code came from and how it was supposed to work. I printed pages of</p>the HTML 3.2 spec. I downloaded image editors, I downloaded browsers, I</p>bought Netscape.</p></p><p><p>Copyright? Hah! Copyright just let me know that I was getting the</p>freshest stuff. Intellectual Property? Hah! Thanks for doing my work for</p>me. You have saved me a lot of time so I could steal more code. God I</p>loved cut and paste!! I stole a program to track the images I had</p>stolen.</p></p></p><p>I began to develop my own code, images, and styles. I became a web</p>designer in 1997. One of my very first sites was stolen. Code, Images,</p>Content and directory. It was one of my largest sites, having 80 pages</p>and 20 handcrafted images. I had already stopped using other folks' stuff</p>and began designing my own. I was outraged. I was angry. I screamed, I</p>yelled, I wrote long raving rants about these thieves to every list I</p>could find.</p></p><p><p>It was the worst day of my web life.</p></p><p><p>When I contacted these miscreants, I discovered that My Client had given</p>permission to post the fruits of my labors on another site. They hadn't</p>done anything different than I had done, except post it on the web.</p></p><p><p>I had to examine what I had been doing daily for the past three years.</p>This marked  the beginning of my recovery.</p></p><p><p>My stealing had been tapering off as so many people were sharing and</p>giving away their information, code and images. They were sharing with</p>me, a source code thief.</p></p><p><p>They knew what I had been doing, and they forgave me. I would email them</p>to ask permission to use something I had seen and they wrote back. They</p>said sure, it's okay. That is how we all  learn on the web.</p></p><p><p>I came to realize that I was not a code god. I was not using anything</p>you could not use. My work can be seen by everyone with a browser and an</p>internet connection. I can be stolen from, judged on my code, have my</p>sites and images stolen. That is how the web works. We all have the same</p>building blocks. Most of you are far better at arranging them than I.</p>This is how I learned. You will too. You may  never look at source</p>code. But I doubt it. You cannot hide HTML source code. It doesn't work</p>that way. This is the nature of the Internet. You may not binge like I</p>did.</p></p><p><p>The web is an Open System. The protocols, the tags, the hardware, are</p>all available for examination and use. We have agreed implicitly and in</p>a lot of cases overtly that it is okay to look under the hood.</p></p><p><p>If you cannot accept the fact that <q>The Emperor Truly Has No Clothes</q> on</p>the web, this is not the place for you. I will respect your decision and</p>wish you well in your new career.</p></p><p><p>Yes, I still peek.</p>
