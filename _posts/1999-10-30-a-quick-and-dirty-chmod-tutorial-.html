<p>'chmod' or &quot;change mode&quot; is the *NIX</p>way of changing file permissions. It is VERY</p>different from DOS/Windows, if you are new to *NIX</p>or always wondered what &quot;drwxr-xr-x&quot;</p>meant read on.....</p></p><p><p>Where Windows/DOS machines realistically have one</p>set of file permissions: Read/Write - Archive -</p>System - Hidden&nbsp; and then add on User</p>Permissions to the files and directories; *NIX</p>breaks the permissions into three groups, 1 -</p>user, 2 - group, 3 - world.</p></p><p><p>When you do an ls -la you might see the</p>following:</p></p><p><TT>[user@linux sites]$ ls -la<BR></p>drwxr-xr-x&nbsp; 16 root&nbsp; root&nbsp; 1024 Oct 20 19:56 .<BR></p>drwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 root&nbsp; root&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 ..<BR></p>drwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 foo&nbsp;&nbsp; user&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 dir1<BR></p>drwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 foo&nbsp;&nbsp; user&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 dir2<BR></p>drwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 foo&nbsp;&nbsp; user&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 dir3<BR></p>-rw-r--r--&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 foo&nbsp;&nbsp; user&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 file1<BR></p>-rw-r--r--&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 foo&nbsp;&nbsp; user&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 file2<BR></p>-rw-r--r--&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 foo&nbsp;&nbsp; user&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 file3<BR><BR></p></TT></p><p><p>All the gobblygook at the beginning of each line is</p>the file permissions. Note: To *NIX, directories</p>are just special files. In order to allow someone</p>to 'traverse' the directory tree, the user must</p>have eXecute permissions on the directory even if</p>they have read/write privileges.</p></p><p><p>Within each set of permissions (you, group, world)</p>there are three permissions you can set: Read -</p>Write - Execute. Therefore when you set the</p>permissions on a file you must take into account</p>'who' needs access.</p></p><p><p>Here's a stripped down list of the options</p>chmod takes: (for more info do a man chmod at the</p>command line.)</p></p><p><p>chmod [-R] ### &lt;filename or directory&gt;</p></p><p><p>-R is optional and when used with directories will</p>traverse all the sub-directories of the target</p>directory changing ALL the permissions to</p>###. Very useful but use with extreme</p>caution.</p></p><p><p>The #'s can be:</p></p><p>0 = Nothing<BR></p>1 = Execute<BR></p>2 = Write<BR></p>3 = Execute &amp; Write&nbsp; (2 + 1)<BR></p>4 = Read<BR></p>5 = Execute &amp; Read (4 + 1)<BR></p>6 = Read &amp; Write (4 + 2)<BR></p>7 = Execute &amp; Read &amp; Write (4 + 2 + 1)<BR><BR></p><p><p>Of course you need a file name or target</p>directory. Wild cards * and ? are acceptable. If</p>you don't supply the -R, with the target</p>directory, the directory itself will be changed,</p>not anything within it.</p></p><p><p>Again you must supply the #'s in a set of three</p>numbers (you, group, world).</p></p><p><p>To make a file readable and writable by you, and</p>only read for your group, and no access from the</p>world,it would look like:</p></p><p><p>chmod 640 filename</p></p><p><p>The result would look like...</p></p><p><TT></p>-rw-r-----&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 foo&nbsp; user&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 file3<BR><BR></p></TT></p><p><p>To make all files that end in .cgi read-write-executable for</p>you, and read-executable for everyone else:</p></p><p><p>chmod 755 *.cgi</p></p><p><p>The result would look like...</p></p><p><TT>-rwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 foo&nbsp; user&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 file3.cgi<BR></p>-rwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 foo&nbsp; user&nbsp; 1024 Sep&nbsp; 5 22:56 file4.cgi<BR><BR></p></TT></p><p><p>Here are some standard permissions for files and</p>directories:</p></p><p><p>[This is a gross approximation, a place to</p>start. Your sysadmin maybe really loose with</p>permissions or a really tight-butt. Your mileage</p>*will* vary.]</p></p><p><p>For Apache running as nobody:nobody.....Most Perl</p>Scripts should be set to 755.  Most HTML files</p>should be set to 644. And most data files that</p>must be written to by a web server should be</p>666. The standard directory permission should be</p>755. Directories that must be written to by a web</p>server should be 777.</p></p><p><p>If the web server is running within the same</p>group as you....Most Perl Scripts should be set to</p>750. Most HTML files should be set to 640. And</p>most data files that must be written to by a web</p>server should be 660. The standard directory</p>permissions should be 750.  Directories that must</p>be written to by a web server should be 770.</p></p><p><p>Your home directory should be 700. If you are</p>operating a ~username type server, the public_html</p>directory should be 777. (You may also need to</p>open up the home directory to 755.)</p></p><p><p>Side Note: any file name that starts with a '.'</p>is invisible to the webserver when a directory</p>list is generated. This is a quick and dirty way</p>to hide a file.</p></p>
