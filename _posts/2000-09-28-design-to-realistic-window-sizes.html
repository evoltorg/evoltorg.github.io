user_biog: "<p>A founder of evolt.org, Marlene (say \"Mar-lay-nuh\") currently lives in Virginia and is a web and print designer, massage therapist, photographer, artist, burner (person who attends Burning Man), dancer, activist and yogini. In years past Marlene served as evolt.org\'s executive director and treasurer, though she\'s not much involved these days. But she still encourages visitors to <a href=\"http://www.evolt.org/article/Help_support_evolt_org/9741/29298/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">give to evolt.org</a>.</p>

<p>Marlene began exploring computer-generated graphics with a purchase of the first Mac 128K in 1984. She\'s subsequently been involved in print design, illustration, and since 1995, professional web design and development. Her other skills are information architecture, usability testing and site management (the largest at 14,000+ pages). Additionally, she\'s taught seminars, has been published on <a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/stories/dice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_new\">A List Apart</a>, and contributed to and reviewed a chapter on evolt.org which appears in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596000359/qid=1036701244/sr=2-1/evoltorg02-20\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_new\">Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, Designing Large Scale Web Sites</a>.</p>

<P>Once you've <A href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Real_World_Browser_Size_Stats_Part_I/17/2295/index.html" title="Learn how to detect your visitor's browser window size" target="_new">figured out</A> what your target audience is using in terms of window size, you need to determine  the realistic window space for designing your site. I've attempted to do the legwork for you.</P></p><p><P>In their article <A href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/templates/print_template.htmlt?meta=/webmonkey/99/41/index3a_meta.html" target="_new">Sizing up the browsers</A>, Webmonkey offers "zipped Photoshop file[s] with the chrome of all the major browsers" for 640x480 and 800x600 resolutions (both Mac and PC). These, and Webmonkey's form elements file (accessible through the same article) can prove to be invaluable. </P></p><p><P>To save you the analysis on your own, I've carefully measured all of the browser windows in Webmonkey's files. The minimum design space you have for the two resolutions mentioned are:</P></p><P></p><TABLE border=0 cellPadding=2 cellSpacing=0 width="100%"></p><TBODY></p><TR align=middle></p><TD><STRONG>800x600<BR>Minimum</STRONG></TD></p><TD><STRONG>Available<BR>Width</STRONG></TD></p><TD><STRONG>Available<BR>Height</STRONG></TD></p><TD><STRONG>Width with<BR>Vert.

If your page will be long enough to require a scrollbar, you also need to pay attention to the final column. Otherwise, your design may get cut off by a vertical scrollbar, forcing the page to also have a horizontal scrollbar.</P></p><P>These measurements assume that the viewers are visiting your site at full screen. In <A href="http://www.evolt.org/user/aardvark/88/index.html" target="_new">Aardvark</A>'s article, "<A href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Real_World_Browser_Size_Stats_Part_II/20/2297/index.html" target="_new">Real-World Browser Size Stats, Part II</A>," his <EM>lowest</EM> results probably reflect the fact that some users weren't surfing at full-screen. I don't surf at full screen, but my monitor resolution at work is set to 1152x870. </P></p><h2>Conclusion:</h2></p><P>It is my opinion that with the increasing number of surfers now surfing at 800x600 (<FONT size=-2><A href="/Design_to_realistic_window_sizes#2">2</A></FONT>) one can possibly design safely at 741x404. However, to really be on the safe side (15% at 640x480 (<FONT size=-2><A href="/Design_to_realistic_window_sizes#2">2</A></FONT>) can add up to a <EM>lot </EM>of visitors), design to 581x284. If you are too lazy to make your own base Photoshop files, you can download mine (zipped):</P></p><UL></p><LI><A href="http://members.evolt.org/marlene/screen_starters/581x284.zip">581x284</A> plus scroll (for 640x480) (1.2k)</LI></p><LI><A href="http://members.evolt.org/marlene/screen_starters/741x404.zip">741x404</A> plus scroll (for 800x600) (1.3k)</LI></UL></p><h2>Notes:</h2></p><OL></p><LI><A name=1></A>As of this article's publishing, Webmonkey's files only include browser version <STRONG>up to</STRONG> the following: Win - IE 5.x and NN 4.5; Mac - IE 4.5 and NN 4.6. Perhaps sometime I'll measure the chrome for newer versions, and report them here.

If we add 11% of the &quot;don't know&quot; category to that figure, it brings the total up to 13%. One can hope there are more people now using monitors at higher resolutions than there were two years ago.</LI></OL></p><h2>Related Articles:</h2></p><UL></p><LI><A href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Real_World_Browser_Size_Stats_Part_I/17/2295/index.html" target="_new">Real-world browser size stats, part I</A></LI></p><LI><A href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Real_World_Browser_Size_Stats_Part_II/20/2297/index.html" target="_new">Real-world browser size stats, part II</A> </LI></p><LI><A href="http://www.evolt.org/article/640_x_480_Isn_t_Dead_Just_Yet/22/275/index.html" target="_new">640 x 480 isn't dead just yet</A></LI></p><LI><A href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/templates/print_template.htmlt?meta=/webmonkey/99/41/index3a_meta.html" target="_new">Sizing up the browsers</A> (Webmonkey)</LI></UL>
