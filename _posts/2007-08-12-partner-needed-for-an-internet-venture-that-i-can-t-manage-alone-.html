I'm looking for someone bursting with ideas, passionate, never gives up, to join me in launching a number of websites targeted mainly at the social networking audience - the fun stuff.  You don't have to be a programmer, you can be anyone who wants the freedom of eventually working for a business they helped create! You will need to be based in London, be willing to meet for strategy planning discussions, and know how to have a laugh along the way.  To get involved you will need to be one of the following:\n- Business developer  - because behind every great website, there's someone who knows what they're doing\n- PHP programmer - because we call, you haul\n- Frontend designer - because without you a fantastic GUI is just a sticky mess\n- Sys admin - because this site won't run on managed shared hosting from 1and1!\n- Lawyer - because everyone's got one
