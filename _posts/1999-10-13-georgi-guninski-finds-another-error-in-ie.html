<p>In recent months the Bulgarian Georgi Guninski has found a number of security related problems with Internet Explorer. With his recent discovery of another potential danger, this number has reached a full dozen.    The latest discovery does not apply to all versions, but is still bad enough. It involves the <b>iframe</b> tag and executed Javascript code using <b>document.execCommand</b> through Active scripting. After Microsoft released    a patch for the "download bug" last week, it advised users to turn off Active scripting.    More can be found on <a href="http://www.nat.bg/%7Ejoro/index.html" target="_blank">Guninski's    site</a>.</p> <p>On a related note, the German <a href="http://www.bsi.de/" target="_blank">BSI</a>    (Bundesamt fur Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, a federal agency for security    in information technology) has issued a warning to all Internet surfers not    to use ActiveX, Javascript or Java. According to BSI, through these methods    Internet users are at a risk of potential but difficult to calculate harm  through the theft of  passwords or other local data.</p> <P>
