<P>The <a href="http://www.webstandards.org">Web Standards Project</a> is taking issue with the lack of standards support in Microsoft's newly released Internet Explorer 5.5 Windows Edition,\n        and lambasting the company for an "arrogant" break with standards.</P>\n<P>\nIn the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/ie55.txt">announcement released today</a>, the WSP expresses frustration with whats become a nightmare for developers in terms of re-writing code for different versions of IE, not to mention the coding differences between IE on different platforms.\n</P>
