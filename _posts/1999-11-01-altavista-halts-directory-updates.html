Now owned by CMGI after a $2.3 billion buy from Compaq, Altavista has halted inclusion of submitted URLs to its search results while it apparently creates a new index. This has been verified by director of marketing for AltaVista Search, Tracy Roberts, who says that when the new index is stable, submitted URLs will be updated. <P> <a href="http://www.news.com/">News.com</a> reports, and I have verified, that only one Web page featuring the word "mp3" has been added since September 11, 1999 - a result which would hardly be expected if they were not delaying updates. Searches for other common words reveal similarly low counts for additions since this date. <P> To find out more on this issue, read the News.com article <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1426414.html">here</a>. <P> It will be interesting to see what new technology they introduce with the future index - maybe it's something backend to speed processing, or maybe it's another experiment in alternative money-making methods from search results at the frontend... <P> <P>
