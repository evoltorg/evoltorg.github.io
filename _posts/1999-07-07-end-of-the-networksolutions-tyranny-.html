The Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers (<a href="http://www.icann.org">ICANN</a>) Wednesday added 15 companies to its roster of accreditation qualifiers, with the new batch joining the turbulent market of domain registrars. Check out the story <a href="http://www.icann.org/icann-pr06july99.htm">on their site</a>. I really see them as the 'Good' side of the domain name force and NSI as the 'dark' side. Good news for anyone that wants to register a domain name in the future.
