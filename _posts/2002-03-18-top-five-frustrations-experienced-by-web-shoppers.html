<p>The Retail Forward </p>  company just carried out a <a href="http://www.retailforward.com/freecontent/pressreleases/press33.asp" target="_blank">survey</a> </p>  about the top five frustrations experienced by online shoppers. This is not </p>  exactly new but it still gives us a &quot;quantified&quot; confirmation of what </p>  to avoid when trying to convert lookers into buyers and customize them.</p></p><p><h2>Pop-ups: 52% of Internet users reject them</h2></p><p><p>Pop-ups come first: </p>  for 52% of the respondents, pop-ups constitute the element Internet users hate </p>  most.</p></p><p><p>Indeed, it sometimes </p>  proves difficult to put up with their extremely intrusive nature (size, position, </p>  animated elements...).</p></p><p><p>In our study &quot;Home </p>  pages that sell&quot;, we determined that only 15% of the sites of our panel </p>  used pop-ups on their home page and that only one single web site within the </p>  group with the best Internet performances used a pop-up on its home page (looker-to-booker </p>  conversion rate higher than 8%).</p></p><p><p>And yet, the frustation </p>  pop-ups cause is also linked to their message. If it is an incentive such as </p>  free delivery, they sure become more &quot;bearable&quot;.</p></p><p><p>If you still want </p>  to use a pop-up, despite Internet users' dislike for this display technique, </p>  you should at least try and use one of reasonable size and avoid putting it </p>  right in the middle of the screen ; you should also supply a button, so that </p>  users can close it.</p></p><p><p>Please also see </p>  that it does not come up each time users go back to your home page. And finally, </p>  try and use this technique for special occasions and for a limited period of </p>  time only: a pop-up box must not become a permanent element of your home page.</p></p><p><h2>Stop to banner advertisements</h2></p><p><p>Banner advertisements </p>  come second, with nearly the same percentage as the pop-ups: they get as much </p>  as 50% of negative opinions.</p></p><p><p>As far as sites </p>  whose business model cannot do without banner advertisements are concerned, </p>  try and reduce their size as much as possible and isolate them from the rest </p>  of your page, in order to reduce their nuisance.</p></p><p><h2>Complicated pages</h2></p><p><p>Screen reading </p>  is more difficult than reading a printed paper: as a consequence, try and make </p>  it as easy as possible for your readers by giving them well-spaced pages, than </p>  can be understood quickly and easily.</p></p><p><p>According to the </p>  Retail Forward survey, 35% of Internet users declare feeling frustrated by web </p>  pages that prove too complex (too many images, too many advertisements, too </p>  much information on a single page...).</p></p><p><h2>Slimming course</h2></p><p><p>26% of Internet </p>  users declare feeling frustrated by web pages' slow load times. And yet, it </p>  is very easy to answer this problem until broadband has become common use. In </p>  the meantime, you should try and respect those of your visitors who do not have </p>  high-speed connections such as cable yet, otherwise you will reduce your chances </p>  to convert them into buyers even further.</p></p><p><h2>Navigation and high-performance search engines</h2></p><p><p>Fifth frustrating </p>  element: difficulty to find a specific product.</p></p><p><p>20% of online </p>  shoppers report feeling frustrated when they have difficulty finding a product </p>  when surfing on a shopping site.</p></p><p><p>Site navigation </p>  is implied but so are search engines, whether they are too easy or else too </p>  complicated.</p></p><p><p>In total, among </p>  those top five frustrating elements for online shoppers, the fifth happens to </p>  be the most difficult to solve. Luckily, it also happens to be the least frustrating </p>  one.</p></p><p><p>On the other hand, </p>  the top four negative elements could be solved quite easily, and it is rather </p>  difficult to understand how so many shopping web sites still spoil their sale </p>  potential because of their negligence to solve this type of problem.</p></p><p><p></p>  Luc Carton - <a href="http://www.eshopability.com" target="_blank">eShopability.com</a></p>
