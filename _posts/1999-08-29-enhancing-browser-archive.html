I know a lot of browsers have been added since  browsers.evolt.org went live, but I realized that  you wouldn't know this unless you read thelist or  talked to Adrian or went through the list.  So...how about a "what's new" page? It could be  pretty simple, ie:<p> <P>\n8-28-99: Added Netbrowser's ReallyKoolBrowser 1.0  (Mac version)<p> <P>\n8-22-99: Added CoolSoftware's Browser4Dummies beta  version (PC and Mac).<p> <P>
