<p>According to Gerry </p>  McGovern, hypertext links should be treated like traffic lights, and always </p>  use the same colors in a pre-established order: blue, followed by purple.</p></p></p><p><p>Obviously, for </p>  reasons of efficiency and, above all, safety, no one would ever dream of replacing </p>  the three colors of the traffic light system with colored neon lights, even </p>  if it did make them look better (Gerry McGovern &quot;<a href="http://gerrymcgovern.com/nt/2002/nt_2002_03_04_navigation.htm" target="_blank">Web </p>  navigation: traffic light, not neon light design</a>&quot;).</p></p><p><p>Both Gerry McGovern </p>  and <a href="http://www.useit.com/" target="_blank">Jakob Nielsen</a> believe </p>  that it would be a mistake to use any colors other than blue for unvisited links </p>  and purple for visited links.</p></p><p><p>Although I agree </p>  with McGovern that the primary aim of site navigation features should be efficiency </p>  and that making them more flashy usually only confuses visitors, I don't believe </p>  that the colors chosen are all that important.</p></p><p><p>In my opinion, </p>  the main way of characterizing a link is not by using a particular color, but </p>  by underlining the text itself.</p></p><p><p>If the color was </p>  the main characteristic of a hypertext link, all we would have to do would be </p>  to make certain parts of the texts on our sites blue to let users know that </p>  they were clickable. Allow me to doubt the efficiency of this rather simple </p>  tactic.</p></p><p><p>In my opinion, </p>  the color means nothing if the text is not underlined. The color of a link can </p>  make users more aware of it, but it is only of secondary importance. Moreover, </p>  putting underlined links in bold can work just as well.</p></p><p><p>It is interesting </p>  to note that, on McGovern's own site, Nua.com, the links in the center of the </p>  page are indeed blue and then purple once they have been visited, but that blue </p>  is also the color of the site's left- and right-hand columns. Choosing the color </p>  blue for its links is therefore totally in harmony with the site's color palette, </p>  and works well esthetically.</p></p><p><p>However, we also </p>  noticed that, for readability purposes, the hypertext links in the left-hand </p>  menu are white on blue! What's more, they do not change color once they have </p>  been visited.</p></p><p><p>Like the menus </p>  on McGovern's site, the great majority of e-Commerce sites have now given up </p>  using the standard blue/purple colors for links.</p></p><p><p></p>  This was one of the findings of our study of the homepages of the 100 top American </p>  eRetail sites (&quot;<a href="../../reports/homepages/presentation.htm" target="_blank"><b>Homepages </p>  that Sell</b></a>&quot;).</p></p><p><p>The study sample </p>  is composed of sites with browser-to-buyer conversion rates of between 2% and </p>  30.3%. These sites are visited by 120 million users every month and are therefore </p>  totally representative of Internet traffic.</p></p><p><p>The results of </p>  our study show that, as far as hypertext links are concerned, only 27% of the </p>  sites still use the &quot;standard&quot; blue color for unvisited links. In </p>  other words, 73% of these e-Commerce sites now use links that they have customized </p>  in their own colors.</p></p><p><p>Example </p>  of customized links on <a href="http://www.onehanesplace.com/" target="_blank">oneHanesPlace.com</a> </p>  (old and new version of the site):<br></p>  <a href="http://www.onehanesplace.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.evolt.org/evolt/images/20732/visitedlink0.gif" width="111" height="80" vspace="10" border="1"></a><a href="http://www.onehanesplace.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.evolt.org/evolt/images/20732/visitedlink1.gif" width="111" height="80" hspace="20" vspace="10" border="1"></a><a href="http://www.onehanesplace.com/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.evolt.org/evolt/images/20732/visitedlink3.gif" width="128" height="80" vspace="10" border="1"></a><br></p>  We can therefore </p>  conclude that blue/purple &quot;standard&quot; no longer exists - in any case </p>  as far as e-Retail sites are concerned.</p></p><p><p>My second reflection </p>  concerns the question of whether visited links should change color or not.</p></p><p><p>61% of the sites </p>  in our study do not use different colors according to whether the links have </p>  been visited or not. Worse, only 13% of them still use the color purple for </p>  visited links.</p></p><p><p>I'm not trying </p>  to say that these figures demonstrate that the standards championed by Nielsen </p>  and McGovern should be given up for good, but simply to point out that it is </p>  quite clear that users today are not disorientated and/or disturbed if sites </p>  don't use them.</p></p><p><p></p>  Moreover, when a user visits a site selling clothes, for example, he probably </p>  does not need to be reminded whether he has already visited the menswear, sweater </p>  or tie sections: he is perfectly well aware which categories he has already </p>  looked at.</p></p><p><p>The same reasoning </p>  is true for many of the main &quot;repetitive&quot; pages habitually found in </p>  the navigation structure of a retail site.</p></p><p><p>This leads us </p>  to question whether we are offering users a real service by changing the color </p>  of visited links or whether we are not, in fact, making navigation more awkward </p>  for them.</p></p><p><p>In fact, I would </p>  go even further than this and say that it can sometimes be counter-productive </p>  for a site to change the color of its links for certain categories (Best sellers, </p>  for example): the user may not revisit links if their color has changed, although </p>  the site's commercial success may well depend on these categories being regularly </p>  revisited.</p></p><p><p>Admittedly, my </p>  approach goes further than the usability aspect alone, since it is mainly focused </p>  on the eShopability capacities of e-Commerce sites.</p></p><p><p></p>  Choosing the color of links on a retail site and changing the color of visited </p>  links is no longer merely a question of adhering to standards, but of deciding </p>  whether or not they fit in with the site's commercial goals.</p></p><p><p></p>  I'm not saying that Nielsen and McGovern are totally right or wrong, but quite </p>  simply that we should be specifically approaching the subject of retail site </p>  usability from a new angle: eShopability.</p></p><p><p></p>  On an information, a press or a university site, for example, the function of </p>  a link is to let readers know that an underlined text will give them access </p>  to another resource, either on the site itself or on an external site.</p></p><p><p></p>  This type of link corresponded perfectly to the needs of the first sites that </p>  appeared on the Internet. However, the aims of these sites were quite different </p>  from the aims of e-Commerce sites today.</p></p><p><p>In the &quot;informative&quot; </p>  context, changing the color of a link is totally justified: it effectively reminds </p>  the visitor that he has already accessed the information connected to that particular </p>  link.</p></p><p><p>This is particularly </p>  useful for searching the site's archives, for example.</p></p><p><p>However, the things </p>  that make this type of site easy to use do not necessarily work so well on e-Commerce </p>  sites.</p></p><p><p></p>  That said, each approach has its own merits and the two can sometimes be used </p>  together in a complementary way.</p></p><p><p>There is no point, </p>  then, in discarding one system or the other; it is much better to use them appropriately, </p>  not automatically, according to the aim of each particular site.</p></p><p><p>I believe that </p>  Web standards should evolve as users' experience grows. If we try and freeze </p>  certain criteria, by likening them to traffic lights, I don't believe we will </p>  be doing much of a favor either to retail sites or to users.</p></p><p><p>Luc Carton - <a href="http://www.eshopability.com" target="_blank">eShopability.com</a></p>
