<p>This <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/reuters_market/L/REUT-LOM.HTM.htm">Business Week article</a> has the details on the announcement.</p></p><p><p>The article does mention that the Netscape team will apparently continue to manufacture browser-based software... but that this will no longer be as a distinct browser product.</p></p><p><p>Instead, they are choosing to develop Netscape.COM into a Time-Warner media portal of some type.  Interesting comments at the end of the report about AOL working to integrate a "choose-your-browser" function into their interface.... but you have to wonder now what most folks will have to choose from.</p>
