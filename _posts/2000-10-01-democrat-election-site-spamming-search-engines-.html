<p>Inspecting the source code for <a href="http://www.algore2000.com/" title="&quot;Creator of the Internet&quot; [sic]" target="achoo">Al Gore's election site</a>, I noticed that the Democrat candidate trying to    ensure that his site comes up when users search for 'MP3', which reputably is the most common search term across public search engines, by putting it in his meta-tags.</p>\n<p>We also find that he's embedding hidden messages into the code - I wonder what happens if you play the following backwards:</p><blockquote>\n<code>&lt;!-----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Thanks for checking out our source code!  I plan to use this space to post<br>\nspecial messages to those who are helping to improve our web site -- by making<br>\nour site the best it can be.  The fact that you are peeking behind the<br>\nscenes at our site means you can make an important difference to this Internet<br>\neffort.  I'm grateful for your help and support in this campaign.  Now let's<br>\nkeep working to build the 21st Century of our dreams!<br></p><p>Al Gore<br>\n--------------------------------------------------------------&gt;</code></blockquote></p><p>Anyone notice any easter eggs in the Republican site?
