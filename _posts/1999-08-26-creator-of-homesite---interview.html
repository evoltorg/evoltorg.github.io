He sold HomeSite to          <a href="http://allaire.com/" target="_new" title="Allaire Home Page">Allaire</a> (makers of ColdFusion) and worked with them for awhile, but now he's back on his own and has a new product that's determined to follow in HomeSite's footsteps and be the best in its class: <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/" target="_new" title="Bradbury Software Site">TopStyle</a>, a style sheet editor.  <P> I managed to get an interview with Mr. Bradbury to ask him about his departure from Allaire, his new product, and the future of his company, <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/" target="_new" title="Bradbury Software">Bradbury Software</a>.  <P> Read the <a href="http://www.lonesomeroad.com/viewtext.asp?textID=157" target="_new" title="Nick Bradbury">full interview</a>.<P> <P> <P> <P>
