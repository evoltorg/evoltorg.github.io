<p>Sooner or later, every Flash developer is surprised to learn how difficult it is to play a movie backwards in FLASH. When this happens, instinct sends them to one of more than 20 different methods described in online tutorials.</p></p><p><p>Most methods for playing a Flash movie backwards require the programmer to embed a movieclip containing actionscript that monitors the <code>_root</code> level move and determines when it needs to play backwards and where to stop.</p></p><p><p>This brief tutorial presents an alternative approach that can be implemented and scaled to virtually any Flash project. The tutorial is brief because only a few lines of code are required. In fact, It's as easy as 1-2-3.</p></p><p><h2>1. Call to Action</h2></p><p><p>Create an actionscript layer that extends the full length of your movie. In that layer, include the following actionscript:</p></p><p><pre></p>function Movement() {</p>  if (_root._currentframe &gt; _root.mytarget){</p>    prevFrame();</p>  }else if (_root._currentframe &lt; _root.mytarget){</p>    nextFrame();</p>  }else{</p>    stop();</p>  }</p>}</p>this.onEnterFrame= Movement;</p></pre></p><p><h2>2. <code>onPress</code> your buttons</h2></p><p><p>Attach code to your buttons that tells the script the frame to stop on when clicked:</p></p><p><pre></p>on(Press){</p>  _root.mytarget=59;</p>}</p></pre></p><p><p>Using the code above, the movie will play either backwards or forwards to the desired destination.</p></p><p><h2>3. Avoid all Stops</h2></p><p><p>As written, the code eliminates the need to have <code>stop()</code> commands throughout the movie since you can indicate all stopping points within navigation. Movieclips can still be used on stopped frames to create animations as desired.</p></p><p><p>Over time, you'll find this method of moving backwards and forwards in the timeline to be very adaptable. Enjoy!</p>
