Following BT's <a href='/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=609&catid=1'>announcement</a>, Telewest, the UK's biggest cable player, has also announced free calls to their ISP. <P>\nWhile you will be restricted to their ISP and their phone service, Telewest have not made their <a href='http://www.cableinet.co.uk/html/surfunlimited.html' target='_blank'>announcement</a> conditional to approvel from Oftel (the UK's telecoms regulator) before they launch. They have also committed to a date - 14th Feb. Best of all, I'm a Telewest customer *superhappyfundance*.<P>\nGiven that the two biggest players in the domestic market intend to go free, the rest of the market will have to follow. <P>\nCase closed. Roll on ADSL & Cable Modems.<P>
