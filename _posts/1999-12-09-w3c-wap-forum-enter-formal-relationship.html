From the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/1999/12/W3C-WAP-CG-pr.html.en">press release</A>:<BR> <P><TT> "8 December 1999 -- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)and the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) Forum (www.wapforum.org) today announced a formal liaison relationship to define next-generation Web specifications that support the full participation of wireless devices on the World Wide Web. The WAP Forum and W3C are working together to develop a common process of producing next-generation, XML-based Web specifications, define testing and implementation processes, and promote these specifications to the industry at large."</TT> </P> Perhaps this will ease some fears about the "proprietary" nature of WML and certainly ensures the long term growth and adoption of this standard. <P>
