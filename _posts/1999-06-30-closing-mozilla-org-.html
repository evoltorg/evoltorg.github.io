Mozilla.org is responsible for guiding the open-source development of Communicator and is now funded by America Online.  The development work has been mostly done by Netscape engineers with little involvement from outside help. According to Sun Microsystem's Software Products and Platorm Division president, Alan Baratz, &quot;I'm not sure Mozilla.org is working all that well.&quot;  Sun is looking into other options for the future development of the browser.
