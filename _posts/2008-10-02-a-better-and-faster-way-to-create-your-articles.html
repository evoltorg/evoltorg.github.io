excerpt: "les together, extract information here and there, and compile them together into a brand new article. Or you can take the easy way out and pay someone else to do it for you. All of the above methods do have their short-comings. If you are writing your own article, you would need plenty of time to do the research. If you are paying someone to write for you, the end product may not be what you desired. Yes, of course. I am sure that you have heard of PLR products. So what exactly are PLR products? Then you have to visit www.press-release-profits.com to check the details. They are actually ready made products that come with private label rights. So if you can lay your hands on a PLR product, then you have exclusive ownership of that product. You can then use it anyway as you wish: change the packaging, the title, the contents; you can do just about anything you want with that product. "

PLR articles are hot items on the Internet at the moment, with many membership sites offering such articles for a monthly fee. Depending on the owner of the site, you can get up to 30, 50 or even hundreds of PLR articles every month, and each of them has a word count of between 400 to 800 words. But then again, nothing is perfect, and the same can be said of PLR articles. Although such articles can seem to be very handy, they do have their limitations. Duplicate content with so many other members using the same PLR articles, it is inevitable that two or more members are going to use the same articles for content on their website, resulting in duplicate content. And this is where the problem starts. The search engines do not allow duplicate content, so if a PLR article is used as such by two or more owners of the same, all the affected websites will be penalized, and their page rank will suffer as a result. </p>The restrictions of article directories Users of PLR articles often submit such articles to article directories. Big mistake, because article directories simply do not accept PLR articles, and will ban member accounts if they are caught submitting such articles. The above are two very unfavorable limitations that restrict the potential of PLR articles. So what can be done to bend the rules? The solution is actually quite a simple one.
