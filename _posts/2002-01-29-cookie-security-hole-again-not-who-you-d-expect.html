<p>With all the buzz around these days by the anti-Microsoft crowd about how insecure Microsoft's Internet Explorer is, it's quite ironic to see a security notice come out about a cookie problem existing in the anti-Microsoft crowds' browser of choice &#8212; Mozilla.  What's even more ironic is that the security hole was reported to Netscape in the middle of November 2001. There wasn't a fix available until the release of Mozilla 0.9.7, approximately 1&frac12; months after it was reported. And there's no mention of this fix in the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla0.9.7/" target="_blank" title="read the release notes for 0.9.7 (link opens in a new window)">release notes</a>, though it was reported as fixed to Mark Slemko who discovered the exploit.  A very <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-275643.html?legacy=cnet" target="_blank" title="read article at CNet.com (link opens in a new window)">similar security hole</a> was reported to Microsoft within approximately one week's time and a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-055.asp" target="_blank" title="get the patch (link opens in a new window">patch was available within 4 days</a>. There was plenty of noise about how Microsoft wasn't quick enough to address the issue.  How come we don't hear the same amount of noise (or, more appropriately, <em>more</em> noise) about Netscape dropping the ball on this issue for so long?</p></p><p><p>There's a more in-depth news article available at <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/56/23865.html" target="_blank" title="visit theregister.com (link opens in a new window)">TheRegister.com</a>.
