user_biog: "<p>Madhu Menon is a chef and restaurant owner based in Bangalore, India - the so-called \"Silicon Valley of India\". 

He has been online since 1994 when people used <a title=\"What's gopher? Here's the Webopedia.com definition.\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/g/gopher.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">gopher</a> more than the WWW. 

Madhu used to be a user experience consultant in times long gone but dumped his entire career in Web development to pursue the other passion in his life - cooking. He started an upmarket gourmet South-east <a href=\"http://www.shiokfood.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asian restaurant called Shiok in Bangalore</a> where he serves food from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.
</p>

<p>In a past life, Madhu has been the Webmaster of several large sites, including the now defunct <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNET</a> India. He was last seen masquerading as the head of the user experience department at an Internet solutions company. When not doing anything useful, he can be found ranting on his weblog at <a href=\"http://madmanweb.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://madmanweb.com</a>.</p>

Oh, and he's also the Language Nazi admin at evolt.org"

excerpt: "404 error pages are evil. They disappoint users who expected to find something. Disappointed users are not good for site traffic. But with a little bit of thought, you can recover gracefully from 404 errors and help users find what they want."

<p>Ever encountered a "404 error" message on a site? Also known as a "page </p>not found" error, it can really annoy visitors. Some of these folks may never </p>return to your site. If you don't handle these people with care, you could drive </p>important traffic away from your site. Now, you really don't want to do that, </p>do you?</p></p></p><p><p>Links go "missing" for a whole bunch of reasons:</p></p><ol></p>  <li>You moved the page elsewhere. Instead of grouping "mutual funds" </p>    under "Investments", perhaps you moved it to "Personal Finance" </p>    (for example)</li></p>  <li> Some other site linked to a page on your site. Either they got the link </p>    wrong or the linked page no longer exists (tip: pleaseï¿½ try not to re-architect </p>    your site unless absolutely necessary).</li></p>  <li> A search engine still maintains an old index of your site and hasn't updated </p>    it in years. </li></p>  <li> Somebody made a minor mistake typing the URL in e.g., product.htm instead </p>    of product.html</li></p></ol></p><p>But that's no reason to allow visitors to leave disappointed! Every site must </p>  have a custom "404 page" that tries to help people find what they </p>  thought they'd find. Experienced web developers (of whom there are lots on the thelist) know that such a page is essential for a large, high-traffic site. Or at least they </p>  ought to. If that's the case, why do some of the most popular sites on the Internet </p>  not have one? Here are some examples...</p></p><p><ul></p>  <li><a href="http://cnn.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://cnn.com/AnErrorPage.html</a></li></p>  <li><a href="http://slashdot.org/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://slashdot.org/AnErrorPage.html</a></li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.ebay.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.ebay.com/AnErrorPage.html</a></li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.time.com/time/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.time.com/time/AnErrorPage.html</a></li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.sony.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.sony.com/AnErrorPage.html</a></li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.hp.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.hp.com/AnErrorPage.html</a></li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.fedex.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.fedex.com/AnErrorPage.html</a></li></p></ul></p><p>... and still more well-known sites have practically useless 404 error pages. </p>  Some examples are:</p></p><ul></p>  <li><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.usatoday.com/AnErrorPage.html</a> (ugh! Stops you cold.)</li></p> <li><a href="http://www.aol.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.aol.com/AnErrorPage.html</a> (as if hitting the "reload" button on </p>    your browser will bring back a page that's been &quot;renamed, moved, or deleted&quot;.)</li></p>  <li><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.fastcompany.com/AnErrorPage.html</a></li></p></ul></p><p>Very few sites actually trap the URL causing the problem and </p>  allow people to enter it into a form without copying, pasting, pressing the </p>  Back button to check the referrering page, etc. Why is that so hard? Instead of asking questions </p>  like "Write to us, telling us what URL caused the problem, where you came from, </p>  what operating system and browser you're using", why not just sniff all this </p>  through a server-side script and use that info? See: <a href="http://www.ask.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_new">http://www.ask.com/AnErrorPage.html</a> </p>  as an annoying example.</p></p><p>Don't drive people away. Here are some ideas for designing more user-friendly error pages::</p></p><ol></p>  <li><b>Don't</b> redirect them automatically to the home page! This is evil!</li></p>  <li>Show a friendlier error message. Use a more informal tone. "Oops! We couldn't </p>    find this page for you. Try these options:" sounds a lot better than "Error. </p>    Missing page".</li></p>  <li> Offer a link to the site map, or better still, reproduce the site map on </p>    the error page. This will help those users that might have been just looking </p>    for a particular section, say, the "Services" page. </li></p>  <li> Offer a link to the site search. Better still, put a search form right </p>    there on the error page. It's good to try and minimize the number of clicks </p>    for a visitor.<br></p>    Offer a link to a guided tour (if you have one) or the "About the site" page.</li></p>  <li> Trap the refererring page (Use the "HTTP_REFERER" server variable) and </p>    automatically send an email message to the Webmaster of the site, notifying </p>    him/her of i) The URL with the error and ii) The referring page</li></p>  <li> On the custom 404 page, have a contact form that the user can fill in if </p>    he/she was looking for something specific. For a particularly nice touch, </p>    pre-fill the "Missing page:" field with the URL of the page that caused the </p>    error, and the "Referring page:" field with the URL of page they came from.</li></p>  <li> Please reply promptly to all mail from users who got a 404 page. Don't </p>    stop at the autoresponder (you do have one, don't you?). Write back to them, </p>    tell them how to find what they were looking for, and do it within 24 hours </p>    of the error. Prompt customer service is so rare on the Web that it will really </p>    be appreciated by your visitors.</li></p></ol></p><p> Using some or all of the above measures will spread that "they really </p>  care about me" feeling amongst your site's visitors, and we all know that </p>  trust is a scarce commodity on the Web.</p></p><p>Are there any decent 404 pages out there? Yes. Here are a few: </p></p><ul></p>  <li>Fool.com - <a href="http://www.fool.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.fool.com/AnErrorPage.html</a> </p>    (Very nice. I like the informal, reassuring tone of this page) </li></p>  <li>PC Magazine - <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.pcmag.com/AnErrorPage.html</a> </p>    (Includes a site search, site map, etc.) </li></p>  <li>Martin Burns' web site: <a href="http://www.easyweb.co.uk/AnErrorPage.html" target="_blank">http://www.easyweb.co.uk/AnErrorPage.html</a> </p>    (employs most of the techniques I've mentioned)</li></p></ul></p><p><b>More resources</b></p></p><ol></p>  <li>ASPToday has a detailed <a href="http://www.asptoday.com/articles/20000120.htm">article </p>    about setting up custom 404 error pages on Windows NT</a>. If you're on NT, </p>    read this.</li></p>  <li>ASP 101 has a <a href="http://www.asp101.com/articles/custom404/index.asp">good </p>    ASP script</a> that traps the referring page and sends a mail to the Webmaster </p>    about the error. You could modify this to log it to a database instead.</li></p>  <li>As Martin points out below, Anthony has written an <a href="http://evolt.org/article/A_Cheesy_htaccess_Tutorial/18/226/evolt.org">article </p>    about doing the same for Apache</a> on Unix/Linux.</li></p>  <li>The <a href="http://www.plinko.net/404/">404 research lab</a> is a site </p>    devoted to just 404 errors. Highly recommended. Includes examples of good </p>    404 pages, whacky pages, instructional pages, etc.</li></p></ol></p>
