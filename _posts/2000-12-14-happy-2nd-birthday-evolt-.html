<p>Another year older, another year... wiser?</p></p><p></p>We've had an exciting year at evolt, and an exciting year in our industry.</p>As the dot com explosion starts to crumble in on itself and companies get</p>ripped apart faster than mice in a pirana tank, evolt remains steadfast on</p>its course. Despite all the turmoil around us, we've kept true to that which</p>evolt was based on: a "community for web developers, promoting the mutual</p>free exchange of ideas, skills and experiences."</p></p></p><p></p>Now, that may not sound like much, if we hadn't done anything between last</p>year and this one we would've stayed the course also, right? But we haven't</p>been standing still. We have more members on thelist and on the site than</p>we've ever had before. We've outgrown our old architecture, redesigned the</p>site, added a variety of new features and are continually getting closer to</p>a seamless integration between the mailing list (thelist) and the web site.</p></p></p><p></p>Not a small task by any means. Sometimes I wonder if .djc and others really</p>have day jobs.</p></p></p><p></p>And what is most important? Not only are people still adding articles and</p>answering questions, but the level of knowledge and depth of experience in</p>these responses continues to grow and expand every day. Perhaps I am biased</p>but I have yet to find a site that is anywhere near as helpful or as giving.</p></p></p><p></p>So, again, I say thank you to the evolt community and to all the people who</p>take the time to answer questions, build new features, or show support for</p>their peers. You make the internet a better place to work.</p>
