<p>It's a pain - you have one machine and you need to <a href='http://browsers.evolt.org'>test your site on Mac, Windows <em>and</em> Linux browsers</a>.</p></p><p><p>Up until now, you could either dual boot your PC to Windows and Linux, or <a href='http://www.fwb.com/emu/sw98_mac.htm' target='_blank'>emulate Windows on a Mac</a>. Doing all three from one box, though? Can't be done, right?</p></p><p><p>Until now.
