Are you getting frustrated with trying to change your contact information with the InterNic? Are you steamed and flustered with trying to move a domain to an other ISP? Read on.                                                    <P></p>I've found that the biggest challenge with InterNIC/Network Solutions is that they are very VERY !VERY! (very) enamoured with email addresses as the security layer (proof of who you are). If you registered your Domain name with User@Foo.com as the contact and now are trying to change that info from User@null.com the InterNIC will reject the requests. Even if you call in. <P></p>Here's what I do. <P></p>If I need to change your contact info, do that first. Get your InterNIC handle and send in a change request form.  <P></p>You can find your NIC Handle by going <a href='http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois/' target='nsi'>here</a> and typing your &quot;lastname, firstname&quot; <P></p>You can get the change form here: <a href='ftp://rs.internic.net/templates/contact-template.txt' target='nsi'>ftp://rs.internic.net/templates/contact-template.txt</a> Send to: <a href='mailto:HOSTMASTER@INTERNIC.NET'>HOSTMASTER@INTERNIC.NET</a> <P></p>Hopefully you still have access to the olde email account referenced in the NIC Handle. Send that change request 'from your olde account'. (If you have to fake the email header information do so, or set your Mail Client to say you are your olde account for this email.) <P></p>You should get two emails back form the InterNIC. The first one is a receipt saying they got it (keep this!). The second saying the changes have been made. If you don't get the second one (don't wait longer than two days), there was a problem and your request had been put in the manual queue. Then you should call them.  <P></p>Network Solutions Customer Service: (703)742-4777  Monday through Friday, 7:00 am to 9:00 pm, EST  (Sometimes the wait is 5 minutes, other times 45 minutes.) <P></p>Make sure you have the Receipt number from the first reply - they will not talk to you without it. They may try and force you to fax it in - press them to make the change now. Ask them why not? What makes the email request invalid? Say &quot;I sent this from my olde email account&quot;. <b>Important --&gt; Be firm, but polite.</b>  They should make the change right then. <P></p>OK - now your contact info is set. <P></p>Now get the domain change form: <P></p><a href='ftp://rs.internic.net/templates/domain-template.txt' target='nsi'>ftp://rs.internic.net/templates/domain-template.txt</a> Send to: <a href='mailto:HOSTMASTER@INTERNIC.NET'>HOSTMASTER@INTERNIC.NET</a>  <P></p>Fill it out and send it in. Make sure you use your 'new and improved' NIC Handle on the form, saves typing and InterNIC wants that versus creating another account. <b>This is important --&gt; Make sure your NIC handle in the change form is the SAME NIC handle on the current registration for Admin, at least. Your NIC Handle should be registered for Admin and Billing, your new ISP will be Technical Contact. If you don't use the same NIC handle - you're screwed.</b> That's why we went to all the trouble to get your NIC handle fixed. <P></p><b>Very Important --&gt; Make sure you contact your NEW ISP and get their NIC Handle and DNS Servers so that they are filled out properly on the form. You must have TWO valid DSN entries or the form will be rejected. </b><P></p><b><font size='+1'>Super Important --> OK - now send the change form from the address registered in your NIC Handle. </font></b><P></p>Again - You should get two emails back from the InterNIC. The first one is a receipt saying they got it (keep this!). The second saying the changes have been made. If you don't get the second one (don't wait longer than two days), there was a problem and your request had been put in the manual queue. Then you should call them.  <P></p>Network Solutions Customer Service: (703)742-4777  Monday through Friday, 7:00 am to 9:00 pm, EST  (Sometimes the wait is 5 minutes, other times 45 minutes.) <P></p>Make sure you have the Receipt number from the first reply - they will not talk to you without it. They may try and force you to fax it in - press them to make the change now. Ask them why not? What makes the email request invalid? Say &quot;I sent this from my olde email account&quot;. <b>Important --> Be firm, but polite.  They should make the change right then. </b><P></p>Now your Domain name should be changed to the correct ISP. <P></p>Since I fixed my NIC Handle and I am registered as Admin on all the domains I work with, getting email change forms to go through has been a breeze. <P></p>GOOD LUCK!! <P>
