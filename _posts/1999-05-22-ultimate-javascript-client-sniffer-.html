The folks over at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_new">mozilla</a> have a really cool <a href="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/examples/javascript/browser_type.html" target="_new">Javascript sniffer</a> that enables you to detect the browser's vendor, version number, and operating system. It has been tested on Navigator\n2, 3, 4, and 5 (developer preview), Internet Explorer 3, 4, and 5, and Opera 3 on Windows 95, Windows NT, the Macintosh, and\nSunOS5. It is believed to be compatible with all JavaScript-capable browser versions on all platforms.
