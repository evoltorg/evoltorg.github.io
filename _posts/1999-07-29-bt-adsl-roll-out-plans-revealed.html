It\'s still not certain whether or not the meanings of CMS, CRM, and B2B have penetrated the alcoholic fog enveloping his brain, but he makes convincing noises to customers about XML, XSLT, Python, J2EE, PHP, Perl, C++, and OpenGL.</p>

After 6 years of "testing" its high-speed ADSL network, British Telecom has revealed that it plans to introduce the service into only 10 cities by March 2000.<p></p>The announcement was made this week, coinciding with industry regulator OFTEL's consultation document on how BT should open its networks to competition, and BT's proposed domination of high-speed internet access in the UK.<p></p>BT has responded by announcing that it will offer wholesale access to its ADSL network for competitors who wish to offer their own ADSL subscriptions. However, this is likely to lead to an end cost of between #50 and #150 per month for consumers.<p></p>Sir Peter Bonfield, BT's chief exective, said that "This roll-out plan is a major step towards making Britain a world leader in the information revolution. By committing to a large scale roll-out, BT will play a vital part in stimulating a competitive mass-market for consumers as well as businesses of all sizes."<p></p>The 10 cities to be blessed by BT's announcement are: Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Manchester and Newcastle. The approximate 85% of the UK not covered by BT's plans can only hope that services will arrive before the turn of the next millenium.
