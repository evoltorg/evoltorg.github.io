Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh is due out this fall with a proposed emphasis on support for Internet standards, a new rendering engine, and an Auction Manager among other features. </p><p>According to an article at <a href="http://www.maccentral.com/">Maccentral Online</a>:</p><p>"Dick Craddock, product unit manager of Microsoft's Macintosh Business Unit, says IE 4.5 was an interim release and that the goal for version 5.0 is to invest in standards so that pages 'just work' for end users. The unit also plans to continue to address everyday needs with innovative features, he adds.</p><p>"IE's new rendering engine, known as Tasman, supports open Internet standards, increasing stability and assuring that Web pages will load, look, and work right, Craddock says. The development team is focusing on CSS 1.0/2.0, DOM 1.0/Win32, HTML 4.0, XML, JavaScript 5.0, and Apple MRJ 2.x. The company is even working on support for such 'iffy' standards as emerging XML versions."</p><p>To read the whole article click <a href="http://maccentral.com/news/9907/21.ie5.shtml">here</a>.
