The ability to use the </p>  world wide web to meet personal, education, information and shopping needs is </p>  being denied to blind and partially sighted people by</p>  a lack of inclusive design and a general ignorance by businesses and webmasters </p>  of the simple steps that can make websites accessible for all.</p></p><p>There are 1.7 million people in the UK who are blind and partially sighted. </p>  Research shows serious sight loss often curtails independent mobility and the </p>  ability to get the information needed to participate fully in society. The opportunities </p>  the world wide web provides for distance learning, shopping and communication </p>  could revolutionise the lives of blind and partially sighted people. It could </p>  reduce dependence on others and it could give a community that is often excluded, </p>  a voice in the 'information society'.</p></p><p>The technology exists, and is becoming cheaper, to allow people with no sight </p>  to use computers, using speech synthesis and braille displays. However, many </p>  websites are inaccessible for blind and partially sighted people as they are </p>  not properly designed.</p></p><h2><a name="2"></a>The legal case</h2></p><p>RNIB believes there should be a legal requirement for web services to be accessible </p>  to disabled people within the spirit of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 </p>  (DDA). The introduction of the first DDA provisions in 1996 and then again in </p>  1999 put accessible information on the agenda of many companies, in some cases </p>  for the first time. Section 21 of the Act, introduced on 1 October 1999, placed </p>  a duty on service providers to make information about their services accessible </p>  for blind and partially sighted people. This has significant implications for </p>  company websites. </p></p><p>As many websites are set up in the USA, another important development in the </p>  legal case is provided by Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act </p>  (ADA). This Act mandates that all federal electronic and information purchases </p>  made after 7 August 2000 must be made accessible to people with disabilities.</p></p><h2><a name="3"></a>The business case</h2></p><p>Making websites accessible to blind and partially sighted people, and all disabled </p>  people, also makes good business sense. RNIB is approached by an overwhelming </p>  number of commercial organisations looking to make websites accessible for financial </p>  reasons. The main business obstacle remains ignorance: ignorance of the potential </p>  purchasing power of disabled people, and ignorance of the ease with which inclusive </p>  design can be introduced.</p></p><h2><a name="4"></a>Access campaigns</h2></p><p>In 1993, RNIB launched the See it Right initiative to make companies and organisations </p>  aware of the need to make information accessible to blind and partially sighted </p>  people, and offered practical advice on doing this. In May 1999, RNIB launched </p>  a campaign for Good Web Design.</p></p><p></p>  This report is part of that campaign. </p></p><h2><a name="5"></a>Research findings</h2></p><p>RNIB carried out research for this report in August 2000, testing the websites </p>  of 17 high street stores and banks against a set of accessibility criteria, </p>  in order to establish the accessibility of their sites to blind and partially </p>  sighted people.</p></p><p>The results were extremely disappointing. All companies in the study failed </p>  to meet the needs of blind and partially sighted people.</p></p><p></p>  No company achieved a 100 per cent pass rate against the five criteria. Some </p>  websites even failed every aspect of the test. </p></p><h3>Banks</h3></p><p>Of the three high street banks we visited online, all failed our assessment, </p>  even though banking is regarded as a universal essential service. Setting up </p>  a current account or paying bills is not currently an option for many blind </p>  and partially sighted people.</p></p><h3>Supermarkets</h3></p><p>Online supermarkets performed particularly badly in the research. Three major </p>  chains failed four out of the five criteria. We know that blind and partially </p>  sighted people find getting to the shops, and reading food labels, very difficult </p>  and now it seems they cannot even benefit from shopping delivery.</p></p><h3>Fast food</h3></p><p> RNIB found little attempt made by pizza delivery companies to provide accessible </p>  websites.</p></p><h3>Clothing and retail stores</h3></p><p>Three of the four clothing stores failed miserably, passing only two out of </p>  fifteen criteria between them. Poor design made entry into the sites very difficult </p>  for people using access technologies. The clothes on sale lacked text descriptions, </p>  leaving blind customers wondering if the beaded satin mules would match the </p>  easy-fit trousers!</p></p><p>The most common cause of inaccessibility was poor or inappropriate coding of </p>  HyperText Mark up Language (HTML), the programming language of the web. Careless </p>  coding included: image files that were not supported by alternative text, upon </p>  which access technology is reliant to convert the image into something meaningful </p>  to blind Net users; poor implementation of frames; and a failure to provide </p>  a screen design that was easy to read. This rendered the pages useless to blind </p>  internet users. </p></p><h2><a name="6"></a>RNIB's recommendations</h2></p><p>Based on the findings of this research, RNIB sets out the following recommendations:</p></p><ul></p>  <li>RNIB urges all designers to take responsibility to ensure everyone, regardless </p>    of ability or disability, can read their designs.<br><br></p>  </li></p>  <li>RNIB recommends use of the Web Accessibility Initiative's Web Content Accessibility </p>    Guidelines, a set of standards which ensures websites are accessible for all </p>    customers (see Chapter 3). While this report does not explore all of the technicalities </p>    of web design in any depth, designers will find sufficient guidance and references </p>    to set themselves on the right path to accessible design.<br><br></p>  </li></p>  <li>RNIB encourages companies who have websites, or who are planning to launch </p>    them, to recognise the needs of blind and partially sighted customers. If </p>    businesses fail to do so, they are potentially losing out on 8.5 million disabled </p>    customers, not to mention their friends, relatives and carers.<br><br></p>  </li></p>  <li>RNIB strongly encourages blind and partially sighted people to contact organisations </p>    whose websites are inaccessible and to raise the issue directly.<br><br></p>  </li></p>  <li>Finally, we hope the companies featured in this report will realise that </p>    the discrimination created through inaccessible websites is unacceptable and </p>    unnecessary. RNIB urges those companies to take the necessary steps to improve </p>    the design of their online services.</li></p></ul></p><p>A printed full copy of the report is available for UK&pound;5.00 from <a href="mailto:CServices@rnib.org.uk">RNIB </p>  Customer Services</a> on +44 (0)845-702 3153, and you can get an electronic copy free of charge from <a href="mailto:julie.howell@rnib.org.uk" title="Opens in your email client">julie.howell@rnib.org.uk</a></p></p><h3><a name="7"></a>Further information:</h3></p><ul></p><li><a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/whatsnew/pressrel/aug2000/webshop.htm">High street shops online fail </p>  blind internet users</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/access">About accessible information</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/whatsnew/pressrel/wtw.htm">Websites that work - free video</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/digital">RNIB's Campaign for Good Web Design</a></li></p><li><a href="/http://www.rnib.org.uk/seeitright/welcome.htm">See it right - how to make information accessible</a> </p></li></p></ul>
