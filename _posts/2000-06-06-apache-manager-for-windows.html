<P>\nFor those that run the <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_new">Apache</a> Webserver on the Windows platform, it can be a pain to start, stop, and restart Apache when setting it up or testing different configurations.\n</P>\n<P>\nTo make things easier, Apache developer <!--<a href="http://brian.threadnet.com" target="_new">-->Brian Moon<!--</a>--> wrote a simple application that sits in the Windows task tray and allows you to start, stop, and restart Apache easily. You can find more out about the application at his <a href="http://brian.threadnet.com/apmgr.html" target="_new">Apache Manager for Windows</a> Web page.\n</P>
