<p>\nMozilla.org released milestone 0.9 yesterday, inching ever closer to its goal of a feature complete, standards compliant, open source web browser.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe 0.9 milestone release is mostly a performance release with some significant rewrites in a couple of spots. Some of the biggest changes you'll notice:\n<ul></p><p><li>\nAutomatic Proxy Configuration has been implemented.\n</li>\n<li>\nPersonal Security Manager 2.0 with improved performance and new UI.\n</li>\n<li>\nMailNews front end has been overhauled with a huge performance improvement.\n</li>\n<li>\nBrowser and Mail now utilize a new cache, and new view manager for improved performance and correctness.\n</li>\n<li>\nLate loading of java has been implemented for improved startup performance and footprint.\n</li>\n<li>\nLong-click means of invoking contextual menus on Mac now implemented.\n</li>\n<li>\nImage rendering library was rewritten from scratch for increased performance.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe final beta milestone is expected to hit by the end of May.  Any release <strong>after</strong> 0.9.1 could be the official 1.0 release of Mozilla if things go well. So download a copy and use the talkback feature to report the remaining bugs!
