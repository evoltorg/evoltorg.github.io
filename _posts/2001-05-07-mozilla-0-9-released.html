Some of the biggest changes you'll notice:</p><ul></p><p><li></p>Automatic Proxy Configuration has been implemented.</p></li></p><li></p>Personal Security Manager 2.0 with improved performance and new UI.</p></li></p><li></p>MailNews front end has been overhauled with a huge performance improvement.</p></li></p><li></p>Browser and Mail now utilize a new cache, and new view manager for improved performance and correctness.</p></li></p><li></p>Late loading of java has been implemented for improved startup performance and footprint.</p></li></p><li></p>Long-click means of invoking contextual menus on Mac now implemented.</p></li></p><li></p>Image rendering library was rewritten from scratch for increased performance.</p></li></p></ul></p></p></p><p></p>The final beta milestone is expected to hit by the end of May.
