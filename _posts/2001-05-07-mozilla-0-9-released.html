<p></p>Mozilla.org released milestone 0.9 yesterday, inching ever closer to its goal of a feature complete, standards compliant, open source web browser.</p></p></p><p></p>The 0.9 milestone release is mostly a performance release with some significant rewrites in a couple of spots. Some of the biggest changes you'll notice:</p><ul></p><p><li></p>Automatic Proxy Configuration has been implemented.</p></li></p><li></p>Personal Security Manager 2.0 with improved performance and new UI.</p></li></p><li></p>MailNews front end has been overhauled with a huge performance improvement.</p></li></p><li></p>Browser and Mail now utilize a new cache, and new view manager for improved performance and correctness.</p></li></p><li></p>Late loading of java has been implemented for improved startup performance and footprint.</p></li></p><li></p>Long-click means of invoking contextual menus on Mac now implemented.</p></li></p><li></p>Image rendering library was rewritten from scratch for increased performance.</p></li></p></ul></p></p></p><p></p>The final beta milestone is expected to hit by the end of May.  Any release <strong>after</strong> 0.9.1 could be the official 1.0 release of Mozilla if things go well. So download a copy and use the talkback feature to report the remaining bugs!
