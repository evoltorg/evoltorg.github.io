A group calling itself the United Loan Gunmen has  apparently hacked the Web site for the NAACP, a  civil rights organization. <p> <P> This marks the first non-profit site hacked by the  ULG that I know of. Previous hacks include C-SPAN,  ABC, the Drudge Report and NASDAQ. <p> <P> The mission of the ULG is murky at best. In the  conclusion of their mini-manifesto which can now  (1 a.m. CST) be seen at <a  href="http://www.naacp.org"  target="_blank">www.naacp.org</a>. If you miss the  big show, check out the <a  href="http://www.attrition.org/mirror/attrition/19 99/09/19/www.naacp.org/" target="new">mirror</a> at <a href="http://www.attrition.org"  target="new">Attrition</a>. <p> <P> This is obviously of interest to anyone who works  on the Net. My first question is: huh? What do  these people think they're accomplishing by  slapping a poorly-written sort-of rant on a major  site? <p> <P> Are these people nuts or, like they claim,  "knights"? Do they have a point? A social life?  How secure are Web sites, anyway? Do you worry about your site's security? <P> <P></p>Just a few questions to get the discussion going.<P>
