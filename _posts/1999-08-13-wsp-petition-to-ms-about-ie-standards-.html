The <a href="http://www.webstandards.org">Web Standards Project</a> is asking for your participation and support! They're asking that you sign a petition that they will present to Microsoft asking them to support standards <b>100%</B> in the next version of IE. This is something we all need to sign to let MS know where we stand on the issue of a standards compliant browser!!  Check out the petition <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/standardsnow.html">here.</a>  <P>
