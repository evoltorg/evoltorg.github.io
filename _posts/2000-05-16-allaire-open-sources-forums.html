<P><a href="http://www.allaire.com" target="_new">Allaire Corp</a> has released its <a href="http://forums.allaire.com" target="_new">Forums</a> product to the developer community under the 'Open Source' banner this week.</p>     </P></p><P></p>You can find the source code (Cold Fusion templates) at the <a href="http://forumspot.org" target="_new">forumspot.org</a> website. Basically, they changed the license terms for Forums to give the end user more freedom in how they use that, but its far from 'true' open source software.</P></p><P></p>Even <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/05/16/1512238&mode=thread" target="_new">Slashdot</a> picked up the news, and there are some good discussions there. Sadly, there are only Windows NT and Solaris ports for Forums currently available. You'd think that Allaire would have a port for its one 'Open Source' product out for the only true Open Source OS it supports, Linux, but it hasn't happened yet. The forumspot.org website claims it will have ports for both Linux and HP-UX out sometime this spring.</p></P>
