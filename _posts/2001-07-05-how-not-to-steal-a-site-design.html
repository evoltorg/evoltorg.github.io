Starting with the communication ends that online media support, he moved back through design, HTML and server-side code. Then he got into running the whole show.
These days he\'s working for <a href=\"http://www-5.ibm.com/services/uk/services/bcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">these people</a> as a Project Manager, and still thinks (nearly 6 years on) it\'s a hell of a lot better than working for a dot-com. In his Copious Free Time&trade;, he helps out running a <a href=\"http://www.purpur.co.uk/shop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloth Nappies</a> online store.
</p>

<p>Amongst his favourite things is <del><strike><a href=\"http://www.zope.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">Zope</a></strike></del><ins><a href=\"http://drupal.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drupal</a></ins>, which he uses to run his <a href=\"http://www.easyweb.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_foo\" title=\"Opens in a new window\">personal site</a>. He\'s starting to (re)gain a sneaking regard for ECMAscript since the arrival of unobtrusive scripting.</p> 

<p>He\'s been a member of evolt.org since the very early days, a board member, a president, a writer and even contributed a modest amount of template code for the current site. Above all, he likes evolt.org to do things because it knowingly chooses to do so, rather than randomly stumbling into them. He\'s also one of the boys and girls who beervolts in the UK, although the arrival of small children in his life have knocked the frequency for 6.</p>

excerpt: "Sometimes creating a site\'s Information Architecture, content and visual design is all too much work. So here\'s the \'one size fits all\' solution - steal an entire site from a foreign company. After all, they\'ll never notice... will they?"

<p></p>Our good friends at <a href="http://www.proximaconsulting.com/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Proxima Consulting</a></p>seem to have problems deciding what to put on their site. Poor lambs.</p></p></p><p></p>They also seem to have had problems with coming up with an effective</p>user experience.</p></p></p><p></p>So, in the best tradition of dumb people everywhere, they stole it. All.</p>Words, images, layout, sitemap down to a URL level. Everything.</p></p></p><p></p>Which would have been fine (in a 'not' sense) except that they stole</p>it from one of the better UK CED and SI agencies, <a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Oyster</a></p></p></p><p></p>...who found it when one of their staff was doing some research last weekend. The</p>only changes Proxima had made seems to have been a crude</p>search and replace on the Oyster name, even claiming that Proxima</p>had merged with companies who had in fact merged with Oyster.</p></p></p><p></p>Since being called on it, Proxima have pulled the entire site beyond</p>the Flash intro. So skipping the intro means you also skip the entire</p>site. Nice.</p></p></p><p></p>Fortunately, <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Google</a> has a cached copy. Here are a couple of samples:</p></p></p><ul></p><li></p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:i5kSpVYB0hU:www.proximaconsulting.com/jobs/commitment.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Proxima's jobs page</a></p>and</p><a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/jobs/commitment.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Oyster's job page.</p></li></p><li></p><a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/oyster/history.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Oyster's history</a> (note the KBW merger info) and</p><a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/oyster/angle.html</p>" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">approach</a> -v-</p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:fyF_JOctSOs:www.proximaconsulting.com/proxima/angle.html+proxima+consulting+KBW" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Proxima's approach</a> (who say that <em>they</em> merged with KBW).</p></li></p></ul></p><p>Oyster took a copy of the offending site and contacted Proxima, which may explain the Proxima site disappearance. I hear that Oyster aren't going to sue... at the moment</p></p><p>Can you imagine being the person responsible, and the meeting held at Proxima to consider his or her future... Are they selling tickets?</p>
