excerpt: "Sometimes creating a site's Information Architecture, content and visual design is all too much work. So here's the 'one size fits all' solution - steal an entire site from a foreign company. After all, they'll never notice... will they?"

<p></p>Our good friends at <a href="http://www.proximaconsulting.com/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Proxima Consulting</a></p>seem to have problems deciding what to put on their site. Poor lambs.</p></p></p><p></p>They also seem to have had problems with coming up with an effective</p>user experience.</p></p></p><p></p>So, in the best tradition of dumb people everywhere, they stole it. All.</p>Words, images, layout, sitemap down to a URL level. Everything.</p></p></p><p></p>Which would have been fine (in a 'not' sense) except that they stole</p>it from one of the better UK CED and SI agencies, <a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Oyster</a></p></p></p><p></p>...who found it when one of their staff was doing some research last weekend. The</p>only changes Proxima had made seems to have been a crude</p>search and replace on the Oyster name, even claiming that Proxima</p>had merged with companies who had in fact merged with Oyster.</p></p></p><p></p>Since being called on it, Proxima have pulled the entire site beyond</p>the Flash intro. So skipping the intro means you also skip the entire</p>site. Nice.</p></p></p><p></p>Fortunately, <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Google</a> has a cached copy. Here are a couple of samples:</p></p></p><ul></p><li></p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:i5kSpVYB0hU:www.proximaconsulting.com/jobs/commitment.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Proxima's jobs page</a></p>and</p><a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/jobs/commitment.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Oyster's job page.</p></li></p><li></p><a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/oyster/history.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Oyster's history</a> (note the KBW merger info) and</p><a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/oyster/angle.html</p>" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">approach</a> -v-</p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:fyF_JOctSOs:www.proximaconsulting.com/proxima/angle.html+proxima+consulting+KBW" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Proxima's approach</a> (who say that <em>they</em> merged with KBW).</p></li></p></ul></p><p>Oyster took a copy of the offending site and contacted Proxima, which may explain the Proxima site disappearance. I hear that Oyster aren't going to sue... at the moment</p></p><p>Can you imagine being the person responsible, and the meeting held at Proxima to consider his or her future... Are they selling tickets?</p>
