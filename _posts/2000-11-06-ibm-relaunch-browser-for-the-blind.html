<p>IBM are about to relaunch <a href="http://www-3.ibm.com/able/hprdoc.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in new window">HomePage Reader</a>, their text-to-speech browser for visually impaired users.</p></p><p><p>The Windows-based browser, which will be version 3.0, is integrated with the bundled ViaVoice Outloud software, and allows users to navigate links from a numeric keypad, although it does not accept speech input.</p></p><p><h2>Features</h2></p><p>The list of new features is not yet available, but version 2.5 included the following functionality:</p></p><ul></p><li>Voice-prompted installation enables a person who is blind or visually impaired to set up HPR independently.</li></p><li>Different gender voices used for reading text and links - making differentiation of content easier. The user can specify which voices read which page elements.</li></p><li>Fast forward function enables users to skim web pages.</li></p><li>Page summary and "Where am I?" commands tell number and location of elements on the current web page.</li></p><li>Six different language versions available: U.S. English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish.</li></p><li>Most language versions can read web pages in any of these languages: American or British English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.</li></p><li>Integrated electronic mail feature called Home Page Mailer.</li>       </p><li>Netscape Communicator Version 4.5, which contains Netscape Navigator, included in HPR package.</li></p></ul></p><p>The bad news is that HPR will cost you money. Version 2.5 cost $149, and 3.0 isn't expected to be any cheaper. However, there is a <a href="http://www-3.ibm.com/able/hprtrial25.htm" title="Opens in new window" target="_foo">free trial download</a>.</p></p><p><p>There is also an IBM mailing list for the browser, IBM-HPR.
