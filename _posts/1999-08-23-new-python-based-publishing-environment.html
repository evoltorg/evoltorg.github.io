Zope is a complete publishing environment for the web. Yeah, it's written in Python. Yeah, it's free and open source. Yeah, you can use straight out the box. Yeah, it's multi platform.                  <P> That's not the point. It offers a new perspective on publishing content on the web with it's "Object Publishing" concept. See how different it is from Cold Fusion, ASP, PHP or even Perl and Python.  <P> Worth taking a look at <a href='http://www.zope.org' target='_new'>http://www.zope.org</a>. <P>
