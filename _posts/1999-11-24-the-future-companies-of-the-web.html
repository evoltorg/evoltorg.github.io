<P><a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN.com</a> is running a story about the top 10 companies that "Will Make the Web Grow".</P> <P> Interesting to see that only two pure software companies    - the <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a> - are listed in the top 10, while six of the top 10 are hardware vendors. </P> <P> Personally, I think that Intel(which ranked number seven) is a powerful company that makes decent chips, but why is it one of the 10 companies that will make the web grow? Servers and PC's can run on any clone chip(or any other architecture for that matter) - and they're totally overlooking the Internet Application market, where the future of the Web <strong>really</strong> is; which isn't <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>'s strong point.</P> <P> An interesting read none the less, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9911/24/top10.hardware.tis.idg/index.html">give it a once over</a> if you have the chance. </P> <P> <P>
