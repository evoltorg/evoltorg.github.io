<a href='http://www.allaire.com' target="_new">Allaire</a> are about to release a stunning publishing system, called Spectra, designed for sites like evolt.org which publish information without hard-coding HTML for each article.</p><p>Spectra is interesting on two fronts. Firstly, it's built entirely in ColdFusion, and secondly, it's around 10% of the cost of equivalent systems such as StoryServer and Broadvision.</p><p>To find out more about Spectra, see <a href='http://www1.allaire.com/Products/Spectra/' title='Info about Spectra' target="_new">Allaire's site</a>.</p><p>To get developers up to speed about Spectra, Allaire are holding a number of teleconferences through October & November. The video is delivered by Web, and the audio by conference telephone call (toll-free in the US).
