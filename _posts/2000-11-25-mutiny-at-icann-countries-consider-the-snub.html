<p>Administrators of country code domains voted unanimously last week to look at moving to root nameservers not controlled by ICANN.</p></p><p><p>The vote, which took place at the ICANN meetings in California, establishes a working group to investigate the possibilities.</p></p><p><p>The domain name system (DNS) is a heirarchy of delegated control. The root servers (the top of the heirarchy) are presently controlled by ICANN, giving the organisation ultimate control over all domains world-wide.</p></p><p><p>Users and administrators of country-code domains (ccTLDs) outside the United States have, for some time, been unhappy at how little attention is given to their views.</p></p><p><p>This move by the ccTLD representatives comes around the same time as ICANN seems set to approve several new US-english based TLDs.</p></p><p><p>More information about the dissent is available from <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/14999.html" title="Country code chiefs, registrars mull ICANN breakaway">The Register</a> and <a href="http://www.tbtf.com/roving_reporter/icann4.html#6" title="On thin ice, internationally">TBTF</a>.</p>
