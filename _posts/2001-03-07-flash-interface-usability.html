<p>\n        <em>The focus of this tutorial is on the use of Flash as a tool \nfor creating straightforward, serviceable, functioning \nWebsites</em>\n</p>\n<h2>Looking at Flash</h2>\n<p>\n        For the last 2.5 years I have been running the <a href="http://www.quintus.org/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Quintus Flash \nIndex</a>, which is a rather large collection of links to Flash sites. The reason I \nstarted it was simple enough: at the time, there weren't any decent collections \nof Flash work on the Web. Yet I wanted to check sites out to see what Flash \ncould do. So I went searching, exploring the world of Flash. As I explored, I \ndecided to bookmark all the Flash sites that I came across. I ended up with a \ncategorized, static list of about 150 links, which I then posted as a Web page, \nthinking that others might find it useful. Suddenly, I was getting 150 visitors \na day, which is really not bad for a one-page site. As part of my internship, my \nsupervisor suggested to implement the thing in ASP, add some ding-dongs, and put \nit online like that. So I did - and it took off. Today, the QFI has links to \nover 2,200 Flash sites, and (amazingly) over 12,000 visitor comments.\n</p>\n<p>\n        The comments area was just something I added because I \nthought it would be a nice feature for people to show their approval or critique \non a site, certainly very useful for the developers. At first I posted a lot of \ncomments myself, trying to inspire people to follow my example. I focused mainly \non overall impression and user friendliness, not really from an expert point of \nview, but rather like a regular user. But the more sites I reviewed, the more I \nfound similar errors and mistakes that would confuse visitors. Over time, many \nother people at my site also helped out the site developers: by indicating what \nelements of the sites were unclear, confusing, or even irritating.\n</p>\n<h2>\n        Usability: the User Experience\n</h2>\n<p>\n        Consequently, I have had the opportunity to learn a lot \nabout Internet usability and interface design. I found that a lot of the site \ncritiques on the Quintus Flash Index could be traced back to basic usability \ndesign rules. Not a big surprise, but rather a very clear indication of the \nvalue of some of these rules. \n</p>\n<p>\n        Usability may sound mystifying to some people, and some \nbest-selling books may champion the obscurity of this subject, but there's \nreally nothing too complex about it. Usability is the extent to which a system \nsupports its users in completing their tasks efficiently, effectively, and \nsatisfactorily - which may also include the experience of aesthetic pleasure. On \nthe web, this leads to topics like navigation, speed, clarity and readability. \nThe real trick about usability is the horrible task of letting it seep through \nin your design. Usability extremists call out for Websites with barely any \ngraphics, using only default browser fonts (and default colors), and certainly \nno plug-ins.\n</p>\n<p>\n        But the fact is that Flash is one of the best design tools \nto effectively break most of those extreme rules of usability - and in a very \nshort time. This tutorial attempts to steer both beginning and also experienced \nFlash designers towards a more responsible use of Flash. While this may sound a \nbit loaded, you should realize that, by now, quite a few sites have banned the \nuse of Flash entirely - simply because they had the unfortunate experience of \nhaving Flash implemented on their behalf, but in the <em>wrong</em> way. Yet, when \nFlash is used the wrong way, it creates havoc. But the same might be said of \nHTML. (The designers should have been blamed, rather than the tool!) So, to help \nFlash designers avoid making the same errors all over again, I've written out \nsome pointers, highlighting many of the common errors I've encountered when \nreviewing Flash sites. I hope these hints will be useful to you.\n</p></p><p><h2>\n        Flash is a Tool, Not a Platform\n</h2>\n<p>\n        Flash sites are either sites with Flash elements or 100% \nFlash sites. The latter is a very decent option for small sites, like personal \nsites, or sites that are meant purely for entertainment by animation and sound. \nBut you may want to develop a more elaborate site with features like a forum, \nchat room, response forms, user registration, content management or a search \noption. While doing this strictly in Flash is certainly a great technical \nchallenge, it's not a very wise decision. The fact is that Flash is just a tool \nthat offers a means for designers to turn their ideas into reality. It is not a \nplatform on which to build a Website.\n</p>\n<p>\n        The best sites out there combine Flash with other \ntechniques and formats like DHTML, streaming video, MP3, Java, the common image \nformats like JPG and GIF, as well as any other medium that will offer the needed \ncontent in the most appropriate way to the visitor. The magic rule is to \nconsider every possible medium for each element you want to develop. If you \nunderstand the strengths and weaknesses of Flash, you can apply it where it is \nsuitable, or decide when it may not be the best solution.\n</p>\n<h2>\n        Button Hit Area: Number 1 Mistake\n</h2>\n<p>\n        The single most common error should be mentioned first. \nWhen a text button is created, it is essential that the <em>hit area</em> frame of \nthe button be filled with a solid shape in roughly the same size as the button \ntext field. The effect of an empty <em>hit area</em> frame is a very jerky \nreaction of the mouse pointer. Often, such buttons require surgical precision to \nsimply use the button. The best thing to do when creating any button is to \nchoose a filled shape that covers the maximum dimensions of your button and put \nit in the <em>hit area</em> frame of the button.\n</p><h2>\n        Font Size, Font Type: Squint, Ignore\n</h2>\n<p>\n        On many occasions designers choose to use a Flash movie to \ndisplay textual content in their Website or presentation. Whenever large pieces \nof static text are involved, you should question whether Flash is the best \nmedium to present this information to your audience. The downside of embedding \nlarge text areas in your Flash movies mostly an issue of legibility, but also \nconcerns further processing of the information by the viewer. Often, users \naren't prepared to read through pages of small, anti-aliased text, and will \nusually choose to skip this information - which may be vital. One technique to \nsolve this problem in Flash 5 is offered in the form of Dynamic Text \nfields.\n</p>\n<p>\n        Dynamic Text fields are presented as aliased, selectable \ntext, which not only increases the legibility of small fonts, it also provides a \nmore useful way to present the text. That's because this technique enables users \nto select an area of text and copy it to the clipboard. This is more user \nfriendly, since it provides better access to the information. Many visitors will \nwant a way to extract specific pieces of information. This technique allows them \nto store this information wherever they want, exactly like copying text from \nHTML pages.\n</p>\n<p>\n        For large amounts of text, Flash is usually not the best \nmedium, and other media like HTML, plain text, Adobe Acrobat, or word processor \ndocuments should be considered. Think twice before you start pasting long \npassages of text into your Flash movie.\n</p></p><p><h2>\n        Menu Look and Feel: Is this a Button?\n</h2>\n<p>\n        To hang a painting you need a hammer and a nail (and a \nwall), to water the plants you need a hose. How about this one: to find a phone \nnumber, you need to start reading each page in the phone book from page 1, until \nyou reach the page where the wanted name is listed. No? To view your favorite TV \nshow, you zap to the right channel, watch 30 seconds of a creepily familiar \nintroduction video clip, and then the show starts. If you change the channel, \nbut then come back again, you get to watch the introduction all over again� Does \nthat sound right? When you take the elevator, you just press any of the new \nsymbols that are displayed on a huge array of buttons, and see what each one \ndoes. You keep pressing them, one by one, until you reach the right floor. Oh, \nand the buttons look like chewing gum stuck to the wall. In fact, some of the \nbuttons aren't even buttons: that <em>is</em> gooey chewing gum that you just \nstuck your finger in! Getting annoyed yet? Well, you're not alone.\n</p>\n<p>\n        Usability is all about offering people something they are \nlooking for. That means offering it quickly, correctly, and with maximum \naccessibility. On a Website, accessibility depends on factors like loading \ntimes, user requirements and navigation. Navigation breaks down into buttons, \nstructure, and guidance. Flash offers wonderful tools to create menus, \nnavigation tricks, and really exotic buttons. Everybody that is starting to work \nwith Flash will be thinking about things like an interactive phone for a menu, \nor a tree, a remote control, body parts, cubes, balls, subway maps, giant fruit \nbaskets, planetary models - but remember, no matter how cute or cool or \ningenious <em>your</em> interface might seem to you, it doesn't work if it doesn't \nwork.\n</p><h2>\n        Not Many People Think, "Gray, Square Buttons..."\n</h2>\n<p>\n        Yet, the gray, square buttons are what people know and \nunderstand, just like blue, underlined text. Not very exciting, so we'll need to \nwork out how to merge our galaxy model (or fruit basket) with the users' idea of \na menu, and motivate them to navigate through the Website with it. A solution \nmight be to reconsider your ideas and shape them into a more recognizable menu \nscheme, making your menu items look a bit more like classic buttons and placing \nthem on the top, side, or bottom of the screen. A less drastic solution might be \nto have people test your interface. This way, you could see how (or if) they \nfigure out that those thingies are functional buttons, and then make design \nimprovements based on that information.\n</p>\n<p>\n        A menu design can often be improved by adding pointers, \nlike small pop-ups with your buttons, or a help function that delivers a quick \nexplanation. You should expect that Website visitors aren't very patient, so \nmake sure that a minimal effort is required to <em>use</em> your brilliant \ninterface. \n</p>\n<p>\n        Finally, you won't really be testing your navigation with \npeople if you help them, as this will make this a useless test - unless, of \ncourse, you also have an ingenious plan to be there to help everyone that visits \nyour site. If you want to design usable Websites, you must be hard on yourself - \nbecause your visitors will certainly be unforgiving of your self-indulgent \ndesign lapses.\n</p><h2>\n        Some pointers based on problems I often recognize in Flash \nmenus:\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        Transitions should be short. It doesn't help if the \nneeded segment takes 10 seconds or more to unfold � only to show submenu \nitems.\n</li>\n<li>\n        Try to have the current location highlighted in the menu; \nthis visual cue helps people figure out where they are.\n</li>\n<li>\n        Moving or rotating buttons: even buttons that stop when \nyou move the mouse over them are often very confusing. Slow movement is \nsometimes acceptable.\n</li>\n<li>\n        Button presentation. Sometimes, buttons don't reveal \ntheir function until they're clicked, which is <em>not</em> user friendly. If a \nsquare shape takes me to the links page, does the triangle shape mean I can send \nan e-mail? What about the donut? Good practice is to use the right icons, or add \ntext to your buttons. \n</li>\n</ul></p><p><h2>\n        Skip Intro: All the Way\n</h2>\n<p>\n        Animated Flash introductions: if you really want one, start \nit with a SKIP button. In general, don't make intros. They can be interesting \nfor some entertainment sites, or designer agencies, but it's not right to assume \nthat:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        The visitor wants to wait for the loading of the \nintro.\n</li>\n<li>\n        The visitor <em>will</em> be entertained for 30 \nseconds.\n</li>\n<li>\n        The visitor will <em>then</em> wait for the first page to \nload.\n</li>\n<li></p><p>        The visitor will <em>stay</em> long enough to access your \ninformation. \n</li></ul>\n<p>\n        Intelligent, clear, user-friendly employment of Flash on \nyour Website is a much better reference than an indulgent intro that takes too \nlong to load. Furthermore, <em>if</em> that visitor decides to return to your \nsite, it's not very useful to force them through that intro again.\n</p>\n<p>\n        The only fully justified intro is a light one that \nentertains the visitor while the main Web site loads. But visitors with fast \nconnections should still be able to skip it - all of it. I could take the next \nten pages to tell you the long long story about how the Flash Intro phenomenon \nstarted, but it's not very useful, either. But if I were to tell that story, at \nleast you'd have the mechanism - by turning the page - to move on to the real \ncontent. The best advice on this subject is to consider what, if any, added \nvalue an intro animation will give to your site. \n</p>\n<p>\n        Finally, here's one option that's not really used often \nenough. If you really feel driven to create animations that delight and amaze, \nwhy not create a separate area of your site for Flash experiments? In such an \narea, there is no reason to hold back because in that context, your animation IS \nthe content, rather than an impediment to content.\n</p><h2>\n        Browser Navigation: Back, Help!\n</h2>\n<p>\n        It doesn't seem likely that Flash will ever be well enough \nintegrated into the browsers to eliminate this problem: using the browser \nnavigation buttons is disastrous! When someone's found their way to the \ninformation they needed from your Flash site, and then decides to hit the \n<em>Back</em> button to return to the previous segment, they'll usually end up \nsomewhere unexpected. \n</p>\n<p>\n        A similar annoying result occurs when a visitor attempts to \nbookmark a particular moment in your Flash movie - the bookmark will only return \nthe visitor back to the start of your Flash movie.\n</p>\n<p>\n        Although a self-made <em>Back</em> button can be included in \nyour Flash movie, visitors aren't likely to get used to such features very \nquickly. Your regular visitors may get the hang of it, seeing two buttons with \nthe same label (that is, the browser's <em>Back</em> button, plus your own \n<em>Back</em> button) may confuse first timers. \n</p>\n<p>\n        To facilitate bookmarking of specific parts of the Flash \ncontent drastic measures would be required: split up your movie into several \nsegments, and distribute them over web pages that can be individually \nbookmarked. Usually this effort is worth the extra work, since it has additional \nadvantages. Of course, it saves visitors the drag of navigating back to the \npoint of interest every time they visit the site. But it also helps improve the \nspeed of your Website. Plus, if you update just one of the movies, you'll be \nworking on a less complex .FLA. And, finally, when the update is completed, \ncaching can still be used to retrieve the other pages. Only the changed page \nwill have to be reloaded from the server.\n</p><h2>\n        Site Statistics: Split up your Movies or Go \nBlind\n</h2>\n<p>\n        The method indicated above, which facilitates the \nbookmarking of your Flash pages, can also solve the analysis problem of fully \nFlashed sites. Since a single movie is grabbed from the web server, it's \nvirtually impossible to tell what people are doing inside your site. What \nsegments attract most visitors, what are the common exit points, and which pages \nare never viewed? Website statistics are a valuable developer tool for Website \nimprovements and visitor analysis. Complex schemes can solve this problem, \ninvolving database logging and/or posting to forms from within your Flash \nmovies, which I will not discuss. The easiest, if somewhat crude, way to \ngenerate proper statistics is by splitting up your movie into segments that \nreflect the structure of your site. This enables you to use classic tools to \nview the statistics of your site, since every segment sits in it's own HTML \npage. Furthermore, this solution, when coupled with Metatags, can also ensure \nthat your Flash site is properly represented among the search \nengines.\n</p></p><p><h2>\n        Use of Sound: Music on Demand\n</h2>\n<p>\n        With every release, Flash delivers better support for \nsounds and music. With Flash 5, the new support for MP3 import makes it even \neasier to balance quality sound with streaming and small file sizes. Sounds can \nbe used to add effects to navigation elements, create cool background music \nloops, or to offer sound samples to visitors. But, because the Internet is still \nviewed by a lot of people without audio available on their systems, the best way \nto incorporate the sounds with your web creations is to make it passive. Even if \nyour guests have sound on their system, it may not even be turned on. If the \nexperience of your movie depends on the sound effects and music that come with \nit, tell everybody that they need to turn on their speakers. If you use stuff \nlike a background loop, it's thoughtful to make the sound optional <em>before</em> \nyour visitor starts loading the (often large) music files into your Flash. That \nway those with sound-challenged systems won't have to wait for it to download \neven though they have no way to enjoy it.\n</p>\n<p>\n        Always consider if Flash is the best way to offer your \nmusic items. In many cases, for example if you want to present a streaming video \nclip or offer downloads, other techniques may have better support. \n</p>\n<p>\n        Another thing that deserves mention is the volume of your \nsound clips. Test the audio elements in a movie with normal system volume, to \nensure that it's not too low, but on the other hand to ensure that it doesn't \ncause hearing discomfort.\n</p>\n<p>\n        It's tempting to use sound bytes as a way to improve \nnavigation. For example, a button that tells you all about it's functionality \nwould be nice to add extra clarity to a menu. But, although this technique might \nbe very useful (and impressive), don't rely on it too much. As mentioned before, \nmuch of the Web population relies purely on the visual part of Websites. </p><p></p><h2>\n        Print Option: Will People Understand?\n</h2>\n<p>\n        Flash offers a great way to embed specific content into \nyour Flash movie that can be sent directly to a users printer. A common example \nfor this technique is a small Flash banner that sends a full-page advertisement \nto the printer when the user hits the print button in the movie. It's a nice way \nto avoid cluttering web pages with sundry advertisement details, but it's also a \nway to offer any single- or multi-page document (poster size images, \nspreadsheets, background details) with the click of a small button.\n</p>\n<p>\n        Unfortunately, Flash Printing is a functionality that's \nquite new on the web, and it's a functionality that can't be properly explained \nwith one or two words. So, if you choose to use this feature, make sure to give \na clear indication of its function, with button text like: "Send the details of \nthis product to my printer" or "Print a full-page version of this \nimage."\n</p></p><p><h2>\n        Progress Indicators: What's Going On?\n</h2>\n<p>\n        This topic is easily dealt with. It comes down to this: \neven though loading bars aren't a pleasant sight to look at (a funny or \ninformational preloader is much better), some movies give no indication what's \nhappening during download. "Are we there yet?" For modem users, this can be \nespecially frustrating, because there is no way of knowing whether the movie has \nended, or the connection was lost, or the last bit is being loaded in the \nbackground. (A blank or frozen screen is not very entertaining either.) Progress \nbars are not the most aesthetic solution, if they are designed properly, they'll \nat least provide clarity about loading time. Many good tutorials can be found \nonline to help you create a reliable progress indicator. \n</p>\n<p>\n        Obviously, the best loading scheme is one that goes \nunnoticed. But for heftier movies (or really slow connections) a loading scheme \nand a progress indicator are needed. A great solution is a small game or \nanimation that also indicates progress (percentage). In case you're wondering, \nyes, Pong has been done, just like Memory, Simon Says and Tic-Tac-Toe. But you \njust can't beat the classics!\n</p><h2>\n        Forms: Better Let them Know\n</h2>\n<p>\n        Flash offers reasonable support to embed forms. Many \nelements, like dropdown lists and the use of the �Tab' button, don't respond as \nthey do in classic HTML forms. To get around these problematic defaults, some \nclever ActionScript is needed. \n</p>\n<p>\n        But another problem worth mentioning is that forms in Flash \naren't always easily recognized as <em>forms</em>. This is attributable to the two \nissues: the design of the form is rarely that of a classic web form, and users \nare not (yet) used to Flash forms. So some help is required. Try putting a \nblinking cursor in the first entry field, or better yet, something like a big \narrow that says <em>Please Use This Form</em>, will reduce the chance people will \nleave the page mystified.\n</p>\n<p>\n        There aren't many examples on the Web where Flash forms \nreally use the specific advantages of the Flash medium. Good examples are chat \nroom applications with interactive characters and interactive games that require \nkeyboard input. One clear advantage of Flash is its ability to make form posts \nwithout (re)loading a page. This is a feature that can be exploited in clever \nways, but consider the visitors' expectations (based on classic HTML forms): \ngive clear feedback about post results after submission, or they'll wait forever \nfor a form to submit.\n</p></p><p><h2>\n        Conclusion: the Flash Experience\n</h2>\n<p>\n        This tutorial has addressed only a few of the many topics \nthat are relevant to Flash developers who care about the user friendliness of \ntheir creations. Although some may be very obvious, this is no guarantee that \nthey aren't easily overlooked. Flash has become so versatile that it's hard to \ntell people how they should use it, certainly because it is used for so many \ndifferent goals. The focus of this article has been on the use of Flash as a \ntool for creating rather straightforward Websites. These are sites that want to \ninform, entertain and maybe even educate their visitors.\n</p>\n<p>\n        The most important thing to realize about Flash is that it \nreally is just a tool. If you need to create something, first think about what \nyou want to make, and think about how you're going to realize it afterwards. \nIt's bad practice to assume that Flash is such a cool program that it will be a \ngood way to create anything you might conjure up. If the project has elements \nthat would benefit from the features Flash offers, use it the best way possible \n- again, that doesn't mean using all the imaginable tween effects you can think \nof, but it does mean thinking about the user experience you want to create. </p><p></p>\n<p>\n        That user experience is dependent on overall impression, \nentertainment value, ease of navigation, loading times and the sense of control \nby the visitor. These criteria pose quite a challenge to the best designers and \ndevelopers. At times, it may be boring or frustrating to address these criteria, \nbut in the long run it will make your Flash masterpieces more durable and \nappreciated.\n</p><h2>\n        Online Reference\n</h2>\n<p>\n        This tutorial wouldn't be complete without some interesting links.
