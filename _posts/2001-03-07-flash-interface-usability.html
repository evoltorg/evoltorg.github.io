<p></p>        <em>The focus of this tutorial is on the use of Flash as a tool </p>for creating straightforward, serviceable, functioning </p>Websites</em></p></p></p><h2>Looking at Flash</h2></p><p></p>        For the last 2.5 years I have been running the <a href="http://www.quintus.org/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Quintus Flash </p>Index</a>, which is a rather large collection of links to Flash sites. The reason I </p>started it was simple enough: at the time, there weren't any decent collections </p>of Flash work on the Web. Yet I wanted to check sites out to see what Flash </p>could do. So I went searching, exploring the world of Flash. As I explored, I </p>decided to bookmark all the Flash sites that I came across. I ended up with a </p>categorized, static list of about 150 links, which I then posted as a Web page, </p>thinking that others might find it useful. Suddenly, I was getting 150 visitors </p>a day, which is really not bad for a one-page site. As part of my internship, my </p>supervisor suggested to implement the thing in ASP, add some ding-dongs, and put </p>it online like that. So I did - and it took off. Today, the QFI has links to </p>over 2,200 Flash sites, and (amazingly) over 12,000 visitor comments.</p></p></p><p></p>        The comments area was just something I added because I </p>thought it would be a nice feature for people to show their approval or critique </p>on a site, certainly very useful for the developers. At first I posted a lot of </p>comments myself, trying to inspire people to follow my example. I focused mainly </p>on overall impression and user friendliness, not really from an expert point of </p>view, but rather like a regular user. But the more sites I reviewed, the more I </p>found similar errors and mistakes that would confuse visitors. Over time, many </p>other people at my site also helped out the site developers: by indicating what </p>elements of the sites were unclear, confusing, or even irritating.</p></p></p><h2></p>        Usability: the User Experience</p></h2></p><p></p>        Consequently, I have had the opportunity to learn a lot </p>about Internet usability and interface design. I found that a lot of the site </p>critiques on the Quintus Flash Index could be traced back to basic usability </p>design rules. Not a big surprise, but rather a very clear indication of the </p>value of some of these rules. </p></p></p><p></p>        Usability may sound mystifying to some people, and some </p>best-selling books may champion the obscurity of this subject, but there's </p>really nothing too complex about it. Usability is the extent to which a system </p>supports its users in completing their tasks efficiently, effectively, and </p>satisfactorily - which may also include the experience of aesthetic pleasure. On </p>the web, this leads to topics like navigation, speed, clarity and readability. </p>The real trick about usability is the horrible task of letting it seep through </p>in your design. Usability extremists call out for Websites with barely any </p>graphics, using only default browser fonts (and default colors), and certainly </p>no plug-ins.</p></p></p><p></p>        But the fact is that Flash is one of the best design tools </p>to effectively break most of those extreme rules of usability - and in a very </p>short time. This tutorial attempts to steer both beginning and also experienced </p>Flash designers towards a more responsible use of Flash. While this may sound a </p>bit loaded, you should realize that, by now, quite a few sites have banned the </p>use of Flash entirely - simply because they had the unfortunate experience of </p>having Flash implemented on their behalf, but in the <em>wrong</em> way. Yet, when </p>Flash is used the wrong way, it creates havoc. But the same might be said of </p>HTML. (The designers should have been blamed, rather than the tool!) So, to help </p>Flash designers avoid making the same errors all over again, I've written out </p>some pointers, highlighting many of the common errors I've encountered when </p>reviewing Flash sites. I hope these hints will be useful to you.</p></p></p><p><h2></p>        Flash is a Tool, Not a Platform</p></h2></p><p></p>        Flash sites are either sites with Flash elements or 100% </p>Flash sites. The latter is a very decent option for small sites, like personal </p>sites, or sites that are meant purely for entertainment by animation and sound. </p>But you may want to develop a more elaborate site with features like a forum, </p>chat room, response forms, user registration, content management or a search </p>option. While doing this strictly in Flash is certainly a great technical </p>challenge, it's not a very wise decision. The fact is that Flash is just a tool </p>that offers a means for designers to turn their ideas into reality. It is not a </p>platform on which to build a Website.</p></p></p><p></p>        The best sites out there combine Flash with other </p>techniques and formats like DHTML, streaming video, MP3, Java, the common image </p>formats like JPG and GIF, as well as any other medium that will offer the needed </p>content in the most appropriate way to the visitor. The magic rule is to </p>consider every possible medium for each element you want to develop. If you </p>understand the strengths and weaknesses of Flash, you can apply it where it is </p>suitable, or decide when it may not be the best solution.</p></p></p><h2></p>        Button Hit Area: Number 1 Mistake</p></h2></p><p></p>        The single most common error should be mentioned first. </p>When a text button is created, it is essential that the <em>hit area</em> frame of </p>the button be filled with a solid shape in roughly the same size as the button </p>text field. The effect of an empty <em>hit area</em> frame is a very jerky </p>reaction of the mouse pointer. Often, such buttons require surgical precision to </p>simply use the button. The best thing to do when creating any button is to </p>choose a filled shape that covers the maximum dimensions of your button and put </p>it in the <em>hit area</em> frame of the button.</p></p><h2></p>        Font Size, Font Type: Squint, Ignore</p></h2></p><p></p>        On many occasions designers choose to use a Flash movie to </p>display textual content in their Website or presentation. Whenever large pieces </p>of static text are involved, you should question whether Flash is the best </p>medium to present this information to your audience. The downside of embedding </p>large text areas in your Flash movies mostly an issue of legibility, but also </p>concerns further processing of the information by the viewer. Often, users </p>aren't prepared to read through pages of small, anti-aliased text, and will </p>usually choose to skip this information - which may be vital. One technique to </p>solve this problem in Flash 5 is offered in the form of Dynamic Text </p>fields.</p></p></p><p></p>        Dynamic Text fields are presented as aliased, selectable </p>text, which not only increases the legibility of small fonts, it also provides a </p>more useful way to present the text. That's because this technique enables users </p>to select an area of text and copy it to the clipboard. This is more user </p>friendly, since it provides better access to the information. Many visitors will </p>want a way to extract specific pieces of information. This technique allows them </p>to store this information wherever they want, exactly like copying text from </p>HTML pages.</p></p></p><p></p>        For large amounts of text, Flash is usually not the best </p>medium, and other media like HTML, plain text, Adobe Acrobat, or word processor </p>documents should be considered. Think twice before you start pasting long </p>passages of text into your Flash movie.</p></p></p><p><h2></p>        Menu Look and Feel: Is this a Button?</p></h2></p><p></p>        To hang a painting you need a hammer and a nail (and a </p>wall), to water the plants you need a hose. How about this one: to find a phone </p>number, you need to start reading each page in the phone book from page 1, until </p>you reach the page where the wanted name is listed. No? To view your favorite TV </p>show, you zap to the right channel, watch 30 seconds of a creepily familiar </p>introduction video clip, and then the show starts. If you change the channel, </p>but then come back again, you get to watch the introduction all over again� Does </p>that sound right? When you take the elevator, you just press any of the new </p>symbols that are displayed on a huge array of buttons, and see what each one </p>does. You keep pressing them, one by one, until you reach the right floor. Oh, </p>and the buttons look like chewing gum stuck to the wall. In fact, some of the </p>buttons aren't even buttons: that <em>is</em> gooey chewing gum that you just </p>stuck your finger in! Getting annoyed yet? Well, you're not alone.</p></p></p><p></p>        Usability is all about offering people something they are </p>looking for. That means offering it quickly, correctly, and with maximum </p>accessibility. On a Website, accessibility depends on factors like loading </p>times, user requirements and navigation. Navigation breaks down into buttons, </p>structure, and guidance. Flash offers wonderful tools to create menus, </p>navigation tricks, and really exotic buttons. Everybody that is starting to work </p>with Flash will be thinking about things like an interactive phone for a menu, </p>or a tree, a remote control, body parts, cubes, balls, subway maps, giant fruit </p>baskets, planetary models - but remember, no matter how cute or cool or </p>ingenious <em>your</em> interface might seem to you, it doesn't work if it doesn't </p>work.</p></p><h2></p>        Not Many People Think, "Gray, Square Buttons..."</p></h2></p><p></p>        Yet, the gray, square buttons are what people know and </p>understand, just like blue, underlined text. Not very exciting, so we'll need to </p>work out how to merge our galaxy model (or fruit basket) with the users' idea of </p>a menu, and motivate them to navigate through the Website with it. A solution </p>might be to reconsider your ideas and shape them into a more recognizable menu </p>scheme, making your menu items look a bit more like classic buttons and placing </p>them on the top, side, or bottom of the screen. A less drastic solution might be </p>to have people test your interface. This way, you could see how (or if) they </p>figure out that those thingies are functional buttons, and then make design </p>improvements based on that information.</p></p></p><p></p>        A menu design can often be improved by adding pointers, </p>like small pop-ups with your buttons, or a help function that delivers a quick </p>explanation. You should expect that Website visitors aren't very patient, so </p>make sure that a minimal effort is required to <em>use</em> your brilliant </p>interface. </p></p></p><p></p>        Finally, you won't really be testing your navigation with </p>people if you help them, as this will make this a useless test - unless, of </p>course, you also have an ingenious plan to be there to help everyone that visits </p>your site. If you want to design usable Websites, you must be hard on yourself - </p>because your visitors will certainly be unforgiving of your self-indulgent </p>design lapses.</p></p><h2></p>        Some pointers based on problems I often recognize in Flash </p>menus:</p></h2></p><ul></p><li></p>        Transitions should be short. It doesn't help if the </p>needed segment takes 10 seconds or more to unfold � only to show submenu </p>items.</p></li></p><li></p>        Try to have the current location highlighted in the menu; </p>this visual cue helps people figure out where they are.</p></li></p><li></p>        Moving or rotating buttons: even buttons that stop when </p>you move the mouse over them are often very confusing. Slow movement is </p>sometimes acceptable.</p></li></p><li></p>        Button presentation. Sometimes, buttons don't reveal </p>their function until they're clicked, which is <em>not</em> user friendly. If a </p>square shape takes me to the links page, does the triangle shape mean I can send </p>an e-mail? What about the donut? Good practice is to use the right icons, or add </p>text to your buttons. </p></li></p></ul></p><p><h2></p>        Skip Intro: All the Way</p></h2></p><p></p>        Animated Flash introductions: if you really want one, start </p>it with a SKIP button. In general, don't make intros. They can be interesting </p>for some entertainment sites, or designer agencies, but it's not right to assume </p>that:</p></p></p><ul></p><li></p>        The visitor wants to wait for the loading of the </p>intro.</p></li></p><li></p>        The visitor <em>will</em> be entertained for 30 </p>seconds.</p></li></p><li></p>        The visitor will <em>then</em> wait for the first page to </p>load.</p></li></p><li></p><p>        The visitor will <em>stay</em> long enough to access your </p>information. </p></li></ul></p><p></p>        Intelligent, clear, user-friendly employment of Flash on </p>your Website is a much better reference than an indulgent intro that takes too </p>long to load. Furthermore, <em>if</em> that visitor decides to return to your </p>site, it's not very useful to force them through that intro again.</p></p></p><p></p>        The only fully justified intro is a light one that </p>entertains the visitor while the main Web site loads. But visitors with fast </p>connections should still be able to skip it - all of it. I could take the next </p>ten pages to tell you the long long story about how the Flash Intro phenomenon </p>started, but it's not very useful, either. But if I were to tell that story, at </p>least you'd have the mechanism - by turning the page - to move on to the real </p>content. The best advice on this subject is to consider what, if any, added </p>value an intro animation will give to your site. </p></p></p><p></p>        Finally, here's one option that's not really used often </p>enough. If you really feel driven to create animations that delight and amaze, </p>why not create a separate area of your site for Flash experiments? In such an </p>area, there is no reason to hold back because in that context, your animation IS </p>the content, rather than an impediment to content.</p></p><h2></p>        Browser Navigation: Back, Help!</p></h2></p><p></p>        It doesn't seem likely that Flash will ever be well enough </p>integrated into the browsers to eliminate this problem: using the browser </p>navigation buttons is disastrous! When someone's found their way to the </p>information they needed from your Flash site, and then decides to hit the </p><em>Back</em> button to return to the previous segment, they'll usually end up </p>somewhere unexpected. </p></p></p><p></p>        A similar annoying result occurs when a visitor attempts to </p>bookmark a particular moment in your Flash movie - the bookmark will only return </p>the visitor back to the start of your Flash movie.</p></p></p><p></p>        Although a self-made <em>Back</em> button can be included in </p>your Flash movie, visitors aren't likely to get used to such features very </p>quickly. Your regular visitors may get the hang of it, seeing two buttons with </p>the same label (that is, the browser's <em>Back</em> button, plus your own </p><em>Back</em> button) may confuse first timers. </p></p></p><p></p>        To facilitate bookmarking of specific parts of the Flash </p>content drastic measures would be required: split up your movie into several </p>segments, and distribute them over web pages that can be individually </p>bookmarked. Usually this effort is worth the extra work, since it has additional </p>advantages. Of course, it saves visitors the drag of navigating back to the </p>point of interest every time they visit the site. But it also helps improve the </p>speed of your Website. Plus, if you update just one of the movies, you'll be </p>working on a less complex .FLA. And, finally, when the update is completed, </p>caching can still be used to retrieve the other pages. Only the changed page </p>will have to be reloaded from the server.</p></p><h2></p>        Site Statistics: Split up your Movies or Go </p>Blind</p></h2></p><p></p>        The method indicated above, which facilitates the </p>bookmarking of your Flash pages, can also solve the analysis problem of fully </p>Flashed sites. Since a single movie is grabbed from the web server, it's </p>virtually impossible to tell what people are doing inside your site. What </p>segments attract most visitors, what are the common exit points, and which pages </p>are never viewed? Website statistics are a valuable developer tool for Website </p>improvements and visitor analysis. Complex schemes can solve this problem, </p>involving database logging and/or posting to forms from within your Flash </p>movies, which I will not discuss. The easiest, if somewhat crude, way to </p>generate proper statistics is by splitting up your movie into segments that </p>reflect the structure of your site. This enables you to use classic tools to </p>view the statistics of your site, since every segment sits in it's own HTML </p>page. Furthermore, this solution, when coupled with Metatags, can also ensure </p>that your Flash site is properly represented among the search </p>engines.</p></p></p><p><h2></p>        Use of Sound: Music on Demand</p></h2></p><p></p>        With every release, Flash delivers better support for </p>sounds and music. With Flash 5, the new support for MP3 import makes it even </p>easier to balance quality sound with streaming and small file sizes. Sounds can </p>be used to add effects to navigation elements, create cool background music </p>loops, or to offer sound samples to visitors. But, because the Internet is still </p>viewed by a lot of people without audio available on their systems, the best way </p>to incorporate the sounds with your web creations is to make it passive. Even if </p>your guests have sound on their system, it may not even be turned on. If the </p>experience of your movie depends on the sound effects and music that come with </p>it, tell everybody that they need to turn on their speakers. If you use stuff </p>like a background loop, it's thoughtful to make the sound optional <em>before</em> </p>your visitor starts loading the (often large) music files into your Flash. That </p>way those with sound-challenged systems won't have to wait for it to download </p>even though they have no way to enjoy it.</p></p></p><p></p>        Always consider if Flash is the best way to offer your </p>music items. In many cases, for example if you want to present a streaming video </p>clip or offer downloads, other techniques may have better support. </p></p></p><p></p>        Another thing that deserves mention is the volume of your </p>sound clips. Test the audio elements in a movie with normal system volume, to </p>ensure that it's not too low, but on the other hand to ensure that it doesn't </p>cause hearing discomfort.</p></p></p><p></p>        It's tempting to use sound bytes as a way to improve </p>navigation. For example, a button that tells you all about it's functionality </p>would be nice to add extra clarity to a menu. But, although this technique might </p>be very useful (and impressive), don't rely on it too much. As mentioned before, </p>much of the Web population relies purely on the visual part of Websites. </p><p></p><h2></p>        Print Option: Will People Understand?</p></h2></p><p></p>        Flash offers a great way to embed specific content into </p>your Flash movie that can be sent directly to a users printer. A common example </p>for this technique is a small Flash banner that sends a full-page advertisement </p>to the printer when the user hits the print button in the movie. It's a nice way </p>to avoid cluttering web pages with sundry advertisement details, but it's also a </p>way to offer any single- or multi-page document (poster size images, </p>spreadsheets, background details) with the click of a small button.</p></p></p><p></p>        Unfortunately, Flash Printing is a functionality that's </p>quite new on the web, and it's a functionality that can't be properly explained </p>with one or two words. So, if you choose to use this feature, make sure to give </p>a clear indication of its function, with button text like: "Send the details of </p>this product to my printer" or "Print a full-page version of this </p>image."</p></p></p><p><h2></p>        Progress Indicators: What's Going On?</p></h2></p><p></p>        This topic is easily dealt with. It comes down to this: </p>even though loading bars aren't a pleasant sight to look at (a funny or </p>informational preloader is much better), some movies give no indication what's </p>happening during download. "Are we there yet?" For modem users, this can be </p>especially frustrating, because there is no way of knowing whether the movie has </p>ended, or the connection was lost, or the last bit is being loaded in the </p>background. (A blank or frozen screen is not very entertaining either.) Progress </p>bars are not the most aesthetic solution, if they are designed properly, they'll </p>at least provide clarity about loading time. Many good tutorials can be found </p>online to help you create a reliable progress indicator. </p></p></p><p></p>        Obviously, the best loading scheme is one that goes </p>unnoticed. But for heftier movies (or really slow connections) a loading scheme </p>and a progress indicator are needed. A great solution is a small game or </p>animation that also indicates progress (percentage). In case you're wondering, </p>yes, Pong has been done, just like Memory, Simon Says and Tic-Tac-Toe. But you </p>just can't beat the classics!</p></p><h2></p>        Forms: Better Let them Know</p></h2></p><p></p>        Flash offers reasonable support to embed forms. Many </p>elements, like dropdown lists and the use of the �Tab' button, don't respond as </p>they do in classic HTML forms. To get around these problematic defaults, some </p>clever ActionScript is needed. </p></p></p><p></p>        But another problem worth mentioning is that forms in Flash </p>aren't always easily recognized as <em>forms</em>. This is attributable to the two </p>issues: the design of the form is rarely that of a classic web form, and users </p>are not (yet) used to Flash forms. So some help is required. Try putting a </p>blinking cursor in the first entry field, or better yet, something like a big </p>arrow that says <em>Please Use This Form</em>, will reduce the chance people will </p>leave the page mystified.</p></p></p><p></p>        There aren't many examples on the Web where Flash forms </p>really use the specific advantages of the Flash medium. Good examples are chat </p>room applications with interactive characters and interactive games that require </p>keyboard input. One clear advantage of Flash is its ability to make form posts </p>without (re)loading a page. This is a feature that can be exploited in clever </p>ways, but consider the visitors' expectations (based on classic HTML forms): </p>give clear feedback about post results after submission, or they'll wait forever </p>for a form to submit.</p></p></p><p><h2></p>        Conclusion: the Flash Experience</p></h2></p><p></p>        This tutorial has addressed only a few of the many topics </p>that are relevant to Flash developers who care about the user friendliness of </p>their creations. Although some may be very obvious, this is no guarantee that </p>they aren't easily overlooked. Flash has become so versatile that it's hard to </p>tell people how they should use it, certainly because it is used for so many </p>different goals. The focus of this article has been on the use of Flash as a </p>tool for creating rather straightforward Websites. These are sites that want to </p>inform, entertain and maybe even educate their visitors.</p></p></p><p></p>        The most important thing to realize about Flash is that it </p>really is just a tool. If you need to create something, first think about what </p>you want to make, and think about how you're going to realize it afterwards. </p>It's bad practice to assume that Flash is such a cool program that it will be a </p>good way to create anything you might conjure up. If the project has elements </p>that would benefit from the features Flash offers, use it the best way possible </p>- again, that doesn't mean using all the imaginable tween effects you can think </p>of, but it does mean thinking about the user experience you want to create. </p><p></p></p><p></p>        That user experience is dependent on overall impression, </p>entertainment value, ease of navigation, loading times and the sense of control </p>by the visitor. These criteria pose quite a challenge to the best designers and </p>developers. At times, it may be boring or frustrating to address these criteria, </p>but in the long run it will make your Flash masterpieces more durable and </p>appreciated.</p></p><h2></p>        Online Reference</p></h2></p><p></p>        This tutorial wouldn't be complete without some interesting links.
