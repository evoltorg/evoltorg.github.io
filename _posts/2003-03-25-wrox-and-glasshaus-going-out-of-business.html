<p>Since their parent company ran out of money, <a href="http://www.wrox.com" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">Wrox</a> and <a href="http://www.glasshaus.com/" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">Glasshaus</a> are folding. I don't know how long their existing titles will remain on retail shelves, or if they'll be picked up by other publishers. But if you need any of the info on their web sites, I suggest you back it up now, before the site comes down.</p></p><p><p><b>Additional Details:</b><br>\n- <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/29790.html" title="The Register, UK: Wrox hit the rocks as Glasshaus cracks" target="_blank">The Register, UK: Wrox hit the rocks as Glasshaus cracks</a><br>\n- <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=8339" title="The Enquirer, UK: Online tech book publisher to close?" target="_blank">The Enquirer, UK: Online tech book publisher to close?</a></p>
