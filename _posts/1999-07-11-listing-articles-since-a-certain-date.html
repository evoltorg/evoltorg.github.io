user_biog: "<p><a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> is a Jedi Master in the art of creating sites and keeping servers running. This often means hitting them repeatedly with forces that defy rational explanation, though he prefers to descibe it as \"administration\". When he\'s not practising his percussive skills on E450s and AS400s, he can be found masquerading as the senior developer for some <a href=\"http://www.getfrank.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"My current employer\'s website\">widely varied clients</a>. It\'s still not certain whether or not the meanings of CMS, CRM, and B2B have penetrated the alcoholic fog enveloping his brain, but he makes convincing noises to customers about XML, XSLT, Python, J2EE, PHP, Perl, C++, and OpenGL.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> has been in the web game pretty much since it began, and still has fond memories of the time when a web could be swept aside with a duster and spam was pork luncheon meat. Despite being the developer of one of the first commerce sites in Europe, he has yet to make any real money.</p>
<p>Being English, <a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> doesn\'t like SOAP, but instead has recently discovered something called <a href=\"http://www.zope.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Zope website\">ZOPE</a>. Zope is a platform that runs <a href=\"http://plone.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Plone. It\'s cool.\">Plone</a> which he thinks is the coolest thing since <a href=\"http://www.opengl.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OpenGL site\">high-performance, real-time 3D APIs</a>, which he often writes small games in.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://poked.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Seb\'s site\">Seb</a> lives in <a href=\"http://www.brighton.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Brighton\">the best little city in the world</a>, and used to commute 5 hours a day on British trains. He is subsequently immune to all forms of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=monty+python+spanish+inquisition\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nobody expects this\">torture techniques</a>.</p>"

Something that I think a lot of people would appreciate would be a page where users can request all articles posted since a certain date. There are many people that are unable to view the site on a daily basis, and with the increasing amount of content posted, it might be useful for users to be able to quickly find all articles posted since they last visited.
