According to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_358000/358950.stm" target="_new">BBC</a>, British Telecom is launching a toll-free number for Internet access at weekends. The catch? You have to be using BT's ISP.<p>\nThis may or may not be timed to co-incide with the <a href="http://telecom.eu.org/" target="_new">telecoms strike</a> planned for this weekend.
