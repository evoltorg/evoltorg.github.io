<p>Dave Winer walked into a long-simmering debate when he <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/13#areTablesReallyEvil" title="Scripting News: 'Are tables really evil?' (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">recently asked</a> what's so important about tableless layout. The kinds of passionate responses he received have been regularly heard throughout the web design community&#8212;including places like <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/archive/Week-of-Mon-20010827/056015.html" title="Archived discussion of CSS v. tables on thelist">evolt.org's own lists</a>.</p></p><p><h2>Not ready for prime time?</h2></p><p><p>One of the common arguments against <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>-based design is that reality hasn't caught up with the technology's benefits.</p> </p><p><p>Although no popular web browsers fully support <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/" title="Cascading Style Sheets, level 2 (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">CSS2</a> yet, many of the latest versions (Netscape, IE5+, Opera, and OmniWeb among others) have excellent support for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/" title="Cascading Style Sheets, level 1 (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">CSS1</a> and strong support for CSS2. Even better, the public seems to be adopting these new browsers relatively quickly.</p></p><p><p>A year ago, <a href="http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2001/January/browser.php" title="The Counter's browser statistics for 2001 (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">more than one-quarter</a> of the surfing population used browsers with poor CSS support (including IE 4). Now <a href="http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2002/January/browser.php" title="The Counter's browser statistics for 2002 (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">less than 12 percent do</a>&#8212;putting support of CSS-based design at the same level as <a href="http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2002/January/javas.php" title="The Counter's JavaScript statistics for 2002 (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> and <a href="http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2002/January/java.php" title="The Counter's Java statistics for 2002 (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">Java</a>.</p></p><p><h2>Three reasons why</h2></p><p><p><a href="http://www.davespicks.com/essays/notables.html" title="One of them, Dave Polaschek, wrote the detailed 'Why avoiding tables (for layout) is important' (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">Advocates of tableless design</a> have their own pet reasons as to why style sheets are better (&#8220;it's faster&#8221;, &#8220;there's better design control&#8221;, &#8220;it's the right thing to do&#8221;), but three common reasons are presented again and again:</p></p><p><ol></p>	<li><strong>Semantics</strong>: The <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> table was conceived as a means to display tabular data. Using tables for layout <em>was</em> mentioned in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32#table" title="HTML 3.2 Specification:  'Tables' (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">HTML 3.2</a>, but only to acknowledge existing use&#8212;the concept didn't appear in the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1942.html" title="RFC 1942: HTML Tables (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">original <acronym title="Request For Comments">RFC</acronym></a>. In <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#h-11.1" title="HTML 4.01 Specification:  'Introduction to tables' (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">future recommendations</a>, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> said style sheets, not tables, should be used for layout. Using tables for layouts is like wearing dress shoes jogging&#8212;both work, but they're the wrong tools for the job.</li></p>	<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Screen readers and text browsers <a href="http://www.netmechanic.com/news/vol4/accessibility_no17.htm" title="NetMechanic: 'Accessibility Tip: Designing Accessible Tables Part 2' (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">struggle</a> to read table-based layouts. In fact, the W3C, in its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, explicitly says &#8220;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#tables-layout" title="WCAG 1.0: '5.2 Tables for layout' (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">[d]o not use tables for layout...</a>&#8221; A tableless-layout designed using CSS can present the most appropriate, and usable design for each user agent&#8212;be it a cell phone, a screen reader, a TV-based browser, or a browser running on a desktop computer.</li></p><p><li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: For both the site developer and the reader, a CSS-based design offers a degree of flexibility nearly impossible in restrictive table-based layouts. Not only can developers quickly and easily redesign an entire site by modifying one file, they can also present <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/alternate/" title="A List Apart: 'Making Alternate Style Sheets Work' (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">alternate designs</a> for the reader. Separating content from the detailed structure table-based layouts provide, has the added benefit of future compatibility and portability.</li></p></ol></p><p><h2>Think about the future</h2></p><p><p>Given the direction of current browser development and of the W3C itself, CSS-based design looks to become the <em>de facto</em> method of web design. Before switching to a tableless design, though, designers should consider the site's audience and goals (as they do whenever using anything other than pure HTML):</p></p><ul></p>	<li>Do most of the audience's browsers have good CSS support? <em>If 30 percent of the audience uses Netscape 4.x, for example, switching may not be the best idea right now.</em></li></p><p>	<li>Can CSS be implemented efficiently through all or part of the site? <em>If all of the site cannot be changed immediately, small sections could benefit from CSS.</em></li></p><p>	<li>Can there be <a href="http://www.saila.com/usage/tips/different_css.shtml" title="saila.com: 'Serving different style sheets to different browsers' (Opens in a New Window)" target="_blank">two or more versions</a> of the site? <em>Some sites offer the previous tabled layout to older browsers, and the CSS version to the newer ones.</em></li></p><li>Will the redesign by unveiled now, in six-months, or a year? <em>The longer the planned roll-out, the more likely the audience will better support a CSS-based design.</em></li></p><p><li>Is/will the site be available in multiple formats and media? <em>If so, the benefits of CSS far outweigh the negatives.</em></li></p></ul></p><p><p>Even if a tableless design may not be suitable for one site today, it will be for a growing number of others now and in the future.</p>
