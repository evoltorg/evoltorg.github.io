<h2><a name="why">Why</a> give?</h2>

<p>evolt.org is an <strong>all-volunteer organization</strong> that relies on 
the contributions of its members to operate and function. Thanks in part to the 
generous commitment of the web community, evolt.org provides renowned resources 
and information <strong>without advertisements</strong>. 
Here is a list of some of the services we provide: </p>

<ul>
<li>The Browser Archive<br>
The largest browser archive available anywhere! </li>
<li>Articles<br>
Articles, tutorials and news items written by our members and available free 
to any visitor. </li>
<li>List Servs<br>
Numerous email lists to help disseminate knowledge to the web development 
community, and to help run evolt.org.</li>

<li>The Directory Project<br>
A searchable directory containing links covering web design and development.</li>
</ul>

<p>The opportunities and services we provide are an increasing drain on 
evolt.org's limited finances. Bandwidth costs are our biggest expenditure; we 
currently transfer <strong>250 GB/month</strong>, and that usage is growing. Hence, the 
need to ask for your help.</p>

<h2>Financial <a name="donations">donations</a></h2>

<p>evolt.org is currently able to take donations online using PayPal. You can donate via PayPal in US dollars no matter what your home currency.</p>

<p>Support evolt.org every month using PayPal subscriptions, or a one-off payment.</p>

<p>You can cancel your subscription at any time using your PayPal account. If you don't have a PayPal account, it's fast and easy to sign up during the donation process.</p>

<p>We're sensitive to the fact that the exchange rate and cost of living is very different in different countries. All gifts, of all sizes, are most welcome and help evolt.org provide its services.

<h2><a name="google-ads">Google Ads</a> in the Browser Archive</h2>

<p>We have begun running Google AdSense ads within the <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/">Browser Archive</a>.</p>

<!-- <p>If you'd like, you can now <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://adwords.google.com/select/OnsiteSignupLandingPage?hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;client=ca-pub-9825598862931734&amp;referringUrl=evolt.org">advertise  exclusively on evolt.org!</a>  You can use this link to sign up for a Google AdWords account and target ads to browsers.evolt.org.  

<p>Placing an ad on evolt.org benefits both you (if you're trying to reach a high-traffic, high-quality audience of web designers, developers, hobbyists and professionals) and evolt.org too, because site-targeted ads generate more revenue for the care, feeding and hosting of evolt.org.</p> -->

<p>If you see any ads appear which are inappropriate, or which appear to interfere with your access to the Browser Archive, please <a href="mailto:give@evolt.org">let us know</a> as soon as possible.</p>

<h2><a name="technical">Technical</a> donations</h2>

<p>
At the moment we really need browser mirrors hosted on sites which can do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> can host at least ~ 6 gigabytes of data </li>
<li> can bitshift at least ~ 50-100 gigabytes per month of traffic </li>
<li> can use rsync to cope with:<ul>
<li> automatic incremental one-way at-most-daily synchronisation of the Archive </li>
<li> symbolic links within the Archive </li> </ul> </li>
</ul>
<p>
If you can do that, <a href="/contact/">let us know</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="knowledge">Knowledge</a> donations</h2>

<p>We welcome many types of contributions, and recognise that not all of them 
will be tangible. We value the evolt.org community members who donate their 
time, skills, opinions and expertise to our various list servers, articles, and 
administration and management demands. While evolt.org's financial needs are 
great, there is no evolt without those contributions.</p>

<h2><a name="thanks">Thanks!</a></h2>

<p>If you have questions, please contact 
<a href="mailto:give@evolt.org">give@evolt.org</a>. Regardless of what or how much you 
choose to contribute to evolt.org, it is sincerely appreciated.</p>
