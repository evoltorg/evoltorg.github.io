The Cyberspace Electronic Security Act, the drafting of which is </p>being led by the Office and Management and Budget and the Justice </p>Department, "updates law enforcement and privacy rules for our </p>emerging world of widespread cryptography," according to an </p>analysis accompanying the bill obtained by Federal Computer Week.</p><p>Encryption technology, according to the draft, is "an important tool </p>for protecting the privacy of legitimate communications and stored </p>data" but also has been used "to facilitate and hide unlawful activity </p>by terrorists, drug traffickers, child pornographers and other </p>criminals." The new bill seeks to uncover that activity by allowing law </p>enforcement officials to obtain the keys needed to decrypt messages </p>by applying for search warrants or court orders, much as they might </p>do to uncover other evidence.</p><p>The administration is concerned about the use of encryption </p>technology because advances in recent years have made it </p>extremely difficult for law enforcement officials to crack a code once </p>they have intercepted a message.</p><a href="http://www.fcw.com/pubs/fcw/1999/0816/fcw-newsencrypt-08-16-99.html">more</a>
