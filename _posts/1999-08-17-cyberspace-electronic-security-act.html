The Cyberspace Electronic Security Act, the drafting of which is \nbeing led by the Office and Management and Budget and the Justice \nDepartment, "updates law enforcement and privacy rules for our \nemerging world of widespread cryptography," according to an \nanalysis accompanying the bill obtained by Federal Computer Week.</p><p>Encryption technology, according to the draft, is "an important tool \nfor protecting the privacy of legitimate communications and stored \ndata" but also has been used "to facilitate and hide unlawful activity \nby terrorists, drug traffickers, child pornographers and other \ncriminals." The new bill seeks to uncover that activity by allowing law \nenforcement officials to obtain the keys needed to decrypt messages \nby applying for search warrants or court orders, much as they might \ndo to uncover other evidence.</p><p>The administration is concerned about the use of encryption \ntechnology because advances in recent years have made it \nextremely difficult for law enforcement officials to crack a code once \nthey have intercepted a message.\n<a href="http://www.fcw.com/pubs/fcw/1999/0816/fcw-newsencrypt-08-16-99.html">more</a>
