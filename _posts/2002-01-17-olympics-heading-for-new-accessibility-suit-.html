<p>\nAs <a href="/article/olympics_2002/1/2792/index.html#comment2998">previously reported</a>, the organising committee for the Sydney 2000 Olympics were <a href="http://www.tomw.net.au/2001/bat2001.html#maguire" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">successfully sued</a> by Bruce Maguire over the <a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/parchive/2000/S2000-Jan-11/www.olympics.com/eng/index.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window. This is an archived version as the site is no longer live">official Sydney Games site</a> being inaccessible to users with disabilities. That action only cost AU$20,000 in fines (plus legal costs), but caused a great deal of PR damage to the Games and the Olympic movement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt would seem that the organisers of the <a href="http://www.saltlake2002.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Salt Lake 2002</a> games are heading for the same fate.\n</p>\n<p>\nA quick and dirty analysis shows that the site fundamentally depends on Javascript to display content to the user, from the opening page (and note that this is the <em>full</em> HTML):\n</p>\n<!-- inserted to prevent author box from overlapping code block -->\n<br clear="right" />\n<pre>\n&lt;html&gt;</p><p>&lt;head&gt;\n	&lt;script language=javascript&gt;\n		document.write(&quot;&lt;title&gt;&quot; + ((location.host.indexOf(&quot;nbcolympics&quot;)&gt;-1) ? &quot;NBC Olympics&quot; : &quot;Olympics&quot;) + &quot;&lt;/title&gt;&quot;);\n	&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;script language=javascript src=/x/inc/get_guid.asp&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script language=javascript src=/x/js/xtd_funct.js&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;script language=javascript src=/x/js/stdframe.js>&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;Javascript must be enabled to view this site.&lt;/noscript&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>\nTo the link to registration (It's a Javascript popup):\n</p>\n<pre>\n&lt;a class=&quot;yblnk&quot; href=&quot;javascript:OCW('https://secure.saltlake2002.com/register/','','');"&gt;\n&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;/c/0/32/468/oly_ss_huetgeneric_table.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image: Register and receive free screensaver&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>\nEven more worrying is that the link to the Paralympic Games - yes, the games exclusively for disabled athletes - is also only accessible with Javascript.\n<p>\nThis is a pretty clear breach of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#tech-scripts" target="_blank" title="W3C Priority 1 WAI guidelines - Opens in a new window">one of the Priority 1 WAI guidelines</a>:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>6.3</strong> Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other programmatic objects are turned off or not supported. If this is not possible, provide equivalent information on an alternative accessible page. [Priority 1] <br>\nFor example, ensure that links that trigger scripts work when scripts are turned off or not supported (e.g., do not use "javascript:" as the link target). If it is not possible to make the page usable without scripts, provide a text equivalent with the NOSCRIPT element, or use a server-side script instead of a client-side script, or provide an alternative accessible page as per <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#tech-alt-pages" title="Opens in new window" target="_blank">checkpoint 11.4</a>. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-provide-equivalents" title="Opens in new window" target="_blank">Refer also to guideline 1</a>. \n</blockquote>\n<p>\nStill, at least they've remembered to add ALT attributes.\n</p>
