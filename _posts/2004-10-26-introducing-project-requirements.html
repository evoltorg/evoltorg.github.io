<h2>Introduction</h2></p><p></p>	&quot;But you were supposed to...&quot; &quot;But I wanted...&quot; &quot;But I thought...&quot; </p>	&quot;But that's not what I said...&quot; &quot;Can you just...&quot; How often have you heard these from clients,</p>	suppliers or colleagues? They're frighteningly common, but they share 2</p>	common characteristics:</p></p></p><ol></p>	<li>They're caused by failures in managing project requirements</li></p>	<li>They're 100% avoidable.</li></p></ol> </p><p><p></p>	Without a doubt, the most significant thing you can get wrong in running a</p>	web development is to mess up the requirements. Get this wrong, and every</p>	thing you do after that is doomed. Without the right effort in gathering,</p>	documenting, agreeing and keeping to requirements, you won't deliver the</p>	thing that the client wants, and in many cases, you either won't get paid</p>	this time, or you'll never be hired again by the client.</p></p></p><p></p>	This article will teach you how to avoid this poison chalice and be on the</p>	first step of the road towards consistently delivering effective projects.</p></p> </p><p><h2>Web Development is a Project Management Discipline.</h2></p><p>	<h3>What is a project?</h3></p>	<p></p>		To clarify why this matters	for our industry, let's think about what a</p>		project is and isn't. First off, it's not just a thing done with</p>		large clients, budgets and suppliers. It doesn't necessarily have to</p>		involve money changing hands, or separate client and supplier bodies:</p>		internal work has the same characteristics. That said, I'm going to be</p>		concentrating on client/supplier contractual type projects, assuming </p>		that you're the supplier, as there are some</p>		interestingly specific implications of getting this right in that</p>		setting. </p>	</p></p> 	<p>		</p>		The nature of web development is that it's nearly always temporary</p>		(not necessarily short!) pieces of work, with a beginning and an</p>		end. In that time, you do some things that give an end result that's</p>		noticeably different - and ideally better - than where you started.</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		Well, that's near as makes no difference to the textbook definition</p>		of a project.</p>	</p></p>	<h3>What is a Project Manager?</h3></p>	<p></p>		Do you need to have a job title of Project Manager? Do you need to</p>		be doing it full time? Do you need to have staff reporting to you?</p>		No, no and no. If you have any responsibility for ensuring that the</p>		project happens to time, budget and quality, then you are a PM. And</p>		everything that follows is your responsibility too.</p>	</p></p><h2>Goals, Objectives and Requirements (oh my)</h2></p><p>	<p></p>		Loosely speaking, Requirements are the things that the project must</p>		deliver. However, let's take a step back and think about this from</p>		the point of view of the project sponsor - the person who wants the</p>		project and is prepared to provide money, people, equipment and whatever</p>		else is needed to get it.</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		A project comes into existence to do something: to have the end</p>		result - effect the change - that we talked about above. This is nearly</p>		always expressed in the language of the sponsor's business, as web 		</p>		development purely for its own sake is a rare thing. So taking the US</p>		Moon Landing as an example, the desired result was not a Moon Landing</p>		in itself, or even a Space Programme, but to prove the superiority of</p>		American Technology to the world. Similarly, the result of a web development project</p>		might be to increase sales, or to enable employees to self-book holiday</p>		time. We call these <strong>Project Goals</strong>, and meeting the</p>		Goals is the job of the Sponsor.</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		The project exists to do stuff that achieves these Goals. The stuff</p>		in question we call <strong>Objectives</strong>. These are the things</p>		that the project directly produces: A Man on the Moon;</p>		an eCommerce site; a web-enabled vacation application. Meeting the</p>		Objectives to time, budget and quality is your job as PM. If you do</p>		that, and it doesn't achieve the Goals, its Not Your Problem (tm).</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		So what are Requirements? <strong>Requirements</strong> are the 	</p>		necessary characteristics of the Objectives that are likely to fulfill </p>		the Goals - and that the Project therefore <em>must</em> deliver.</p>		So if I'm the Sponsor, and my Goal is to develop online sales, the</p>		eCommerce site <em>must</em> be highly usable, support customers</p>		browsing products, adding them to a cart and paying for them. These</p>		would be (some - but by no means all - of) the Requirements.</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		To put it another way, Requirements are the detailed view of the</p>		Objectives. They are the answer to the question &quot;What </p>		<em>exactly</em> do you mean when you say you want an eCommerce </p>		site?&quot;	Because Requirements are the things that the Project </p>		<em>must</em> deliver, they are the absolute definition of whether the </p>		project has achieved its Objectives. Meet all the Requirements in full, </p>		and you've done the job. Fail to meet any element of any of them, and</p>		you haven't.</p>	</p> </p>	<p></p>		Naturally, Requirements are contractually binding. And in many</p>		jurisdictions - English Law for one - where a contract is vague, the</p>		customer can interpret it exactly as she likes. So fail to get your</p>		requirements right, and you're setting yourself up for the most mighty</p>		of reamings.</p>	</p>	</p><h2>Gathering Requirements</h2></p><p>	<h3>When to Gather Requirements</h3></p>	<p></p>		As meeting the Requirements is the definition of success, they're the</p>		basis for all your plans: task list, estimates of time and cost, test</p>		plans, the lot. So you need to have them before you can accurately</p>		do any planning. So you need them as early as you possibly can, in</p>		as much detail as you can. You most definitely need them before you</p>		can submit a quote, as otherwise, how will you know whether you can</p>		do the work for the price you've submitted?</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		So now you've got the work, you need to check them again, in much</p>		finer detail than you've been able to do before. You can now revise</p>		your plans and estimates accordingly - hopefully with more accuracy!</p>		Any change at this stage will likely involve a contractual variation,</p>		but hopefully it's just a level of detail thing.</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		The third essential point to gather requirements is whenever</p>		<em>you</em> join the project. With luck, this will just confirm what</p>		you've been told before you joined, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.</p>		Failing to do this is a fairly major assumption on your part, which is</p>		A Bad Thing to do when you have the opportunity to confirm the actual</p>		state of affairs.</p>	</p></p>		 </p>			</p>	<h3>Gathering Requirements</h3></p>	<h4>Step 1: Context Is Everything</h4></p>	<p></p>		Why did I mention Goals above? Because if you don't understand these,</p>		you won't get to the Objectives (and therefore Requirements) that the</p>		Sponsor actually needs. Take the Moon Landing project. The Goal was</p>		&quot;Convince the World of the Superiority of American</p>		Technology.&quot; Just landing on the Moon wasn't enough - the Project</p>		also had to convince the World that it had happened (leaving aside</p>		Conspiracy Theorists for now). So a key requirement of the project</p>		was to ensure global publicity, including live television broadcast.</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		So step 1 is really <strong>Understand the Goals</strong>. How do you</p>		do that? With luck, it'll be documented for you (and if it's not,</p>		the old PM rule of <q>If it's not documented, it's a rumour</q> holds</p>		true), but unless you enjoy working on assumptions, you talk to the </p>		Sponsor and other key stakeholders (i.e. people who have an interest in</p>		the outcome of the project). Useful questions to ask include:</p>	</p></p>	<ul></p>		<li>Why are we doing this?</li></p>		<li>If we're successful, what would be the outcome for you?</li></p>		<li>What would happen if we didn't do this project?</li></p>	</ul></p>	<p></p>		Note that these are all Open questions designed to get the other</p>		person talking...</p>	</p></p>	<h4>Step 2: What do you Need?</h4></p>	<p></p>		Now you've got a feeling for the context, you can start asking</p>		questions (open ones, ideally) that will drive out what it is</p>		that the sponsor needs. You'll also need to talk to anyone who's</p>		affected by the project, or at least a representative of each group</p>		to produce Needs for every major stakeholder.</p>		You'll need some standard information for almost any project, such as:</p>	</p></p>	<ul></p>		<li>Why do you think we're doing this project?</li></p>		<li>What's your role in the project and in the business?</li></p>		<li>How will what we're doing affect your role?</li></p>		<li>What functionality do you need?</li></p>		<li>What would success look like for you?</li></p>		<li>How do you define project completion?</li></p>	</ul></p>	<p></p>		You'll also need some more specific questions probing the capability</p>		and functionality needed. So for a web-enabled vacation tool, you</p>		might include questions like:</p>	</p></p>	<ul></p>		<li>Which staff should have access to it?</li></p>		<li>What hours must it  be operational?</li></p>		<li>How is an employee's vacation allowance calculated?</li></p>		<li>How will we know if an employee leaves?</li></p>		<li>What happens if an employee doesn't use all their allowance?</li></p>	</ul></p>	</p>	<p></p>		You should also be reading all project documentation - contracts,</p>		proposals, statements of work etc - as these nearly always contain</p>		strong hints of what stakeholders are expecting.</p>	</p></p>	<h4>Step 3: Do We Really Need the Moon on a Stick?</h4></p>	<p></p>		In any exercise in gathering Needs, you're going to end up with a</p>		mixture of must-haves, some should-haves, and some nice-to-haves.</p>		You now need to split those three categories into two: <strong>Requirements</strong></p>		and <strong>Exclusions</strong>. Or alternatively, must-haves and everything else.</p>		Every Requirement will be delivered in the project; everything else</p>		will either be entirely rejected - either because it's not technically</p>		feasible or the client won't pay for it - or deferred to a later</p>		project or release.</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		Here's the Acid Test for which box each Need should go into:</p>	</p></p>	<ol></p>		<li></p>			<strong>Is the Need part of the original intent of the</p>			project?</strong> An example of an Exclusion on this basis might be</p>			reporting sick days using the vacation tool.</p>		</li></p>		<li></p>			<strong>Was the cost of delivering the need included in the</p>			original estimate?</strong> Assuming that this has already been</p>			produced of course.</p>		</li></p>	</ol></p>	<p></p>		The Sponsor should have a lot of input into answering these questions,</p>		not least because she will have to agree with your definition, and</p>		you'll save a lot of trouble the earlier you do this.</p>	</p></p>	</p>	<h2>Documenting Requirements</h2></p>	<p></p>		If you remember, the final Requirements will be the basis of every</p>		single piece of planning you will do for the project. So getting them</p>		definitively agreed and not subject to interpretation by clients is</p>		essential. You must produce documentation that is clear and concise,</p>		using graphics, models and other visuals if it helps clarify what you</p>		mean. Your documentation must also be detailed enough for anyone else</p>		to plan or start work on delivering the Requirements.</p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		This should be insultingly obvious, but it's worryingly commonly</p>		missed: <strong>Document everything in writing.</strong></p>	</p></p>	</p>	</p>	<h2>Validating Requirements</h2></p>	<p></p>		Once you've gathered and documented the Project Requirements, you need</p>		to check that you've truly understood them and that they accurately</p>		reflect the understanding of your main stakeholders. You go about this</p>		by effectively locking yourself in a room with those people, and staying</p>		there until you've got a common understanding of every single one of the</p>		Requirements, and an agreement on your Exclusions.</p>	</p></p>	</p>	<h2>Requirements Baseline</h2></p>	</p>	<p></p>		This is a Requirements Document that has been approved by the Sponsor</p>		and is supported by stakeholders and main members of the project team.</p>		It is the formal, contractual definition of what the Sponsor wants, and</p>		that the project team has agreed to deliver (remember Contract Law 101:</p>		contract=offer + acceptance). <strong>It must not be changed without a</p>		formal approval to do so.</strong></p>	</p></p>	<p></p>		What you must do to establish the baseline is take the written output of</p>		the Requirements Validation, put it in front of the Sponsor, and get her</p>		to sign it. You sign it too.</p>		As of that moment, the <em>only</em> place Requirements are</p>		documented is in the Requirements Baseline. Every member of the team</p>		needs to understand this; that any changes to it will affect the</p>		project's cost or schedule, or both and that it is the heart of your</p>		contract with the client. Failing to understand this will inevitably</p>		lead to scope creep, and that is the death of your project. </p>		This means that any proposed changes can only be</p>		implemented following the formal approval of the Sponsor, which only</p>		you can seek. Therefore, all proposed changes have to come to you, in</p>		writing.</p>	</p></p>	</p>	<h2>Wrap-up</h2></p>	<p></p>		The result of all this is that you'll have Requirements that:</p>	</p></p>	<ol></p>		<li>Are understood by everyone</li></p>		<li>Are agreed to by everyone</li></p>		<li>Are documented such that there is no room for arguments</li></p>		<li>Are the basis for accurate planning of work and budget</li></p>		<li>Are capable of being strongly defended against the &quot;This</p>		week's wizard wheeze&quot; type of request</li></p>	</ol></p>	<p></p>		Nothing magical, no rocket science required. Just a simple process</p>		to follow, and the biggest dragon responsible for project death is</p>		slain. And you get to be a hero, which is nice.</p>	</p>
