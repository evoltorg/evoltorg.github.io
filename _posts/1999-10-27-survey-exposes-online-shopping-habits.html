A joint survey by BizRate.com and the NPD Group, questioning 10,000 </p>online shoppers, has discovered that 75% had abandoned a loaded </p>shopping cart prior to payment. Most of us have done it - whether </p>we're simply curious about shipping charges, interested in checking </p>out the technology behind an ordering process, or just unimpressed </p>with the final price of goods. What is important for owners of </p>ecommerce sites, and their developers, is that millions of dollars </p>in potential revenue are being lost - perhaps simply because shop </p>owners lack awareness of what happens in the post-product-choice </p>phase.</p><p>The survey observes that 24% of consumers were unhappy with </p>expensive postage and handling charges, and 17% mentioned that they </p>later bought the same goods offline and free of shipping costs.</p><p>26% shopped around, and bought goods from a competitor.</p><p>To be noted, however, is that more than half of the respondents </p>later returned to the store at which they originally abandoned the </p>cart, and the majority of those made eventual purchases. This is </p>possibly indicative of customers including shipping costs in their </p>price comparisons, or generally being more wary of online shopping.</p><p>Regardless, online merchants could take a hit and reduce shipping </p>costs, but in turn, gain a customer.</p><p>Links:</p><ul></p><li><a href="http://www.newswire.com.au/9910/shopaba.htm">A Newswire article about the survey</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.bizrate.com/">BizRate.com</a></li></p><li><a href="http://www.npd.com/">the NPD Group</a></li></p></ul>
