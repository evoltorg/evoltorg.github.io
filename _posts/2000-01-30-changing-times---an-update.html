<p>Having shot off my mouth, I did some research.</p> <p>Here's what I've found so far:</p> <ul><li>According to Jakob Nielsen                                                                          [<i>ed. note: <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/990418.html" target="_new">Stuck With Old Browsers Until 2003</a></i>], Mozilla is unlikely to ever supersede Communicator 4 in terms of market share.  Can this prediction be proven wrong?  I think it can.</li> <li>Specific and clear documentation on what Mozilla wants from JavaScript to access the DOM is still lacking [<i>ed. note: <a href="http://www.inquiry.com/techtips/dhtml_pro/10min/10min1299/10min1299.asp" target="_new">Get Ready for Navigator 5.0 DHTML</a></i>].  <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_new">W3C</a> explicitly calls for something along the lines of 'document.tags.elementType' (my paraphrase), but I at least am still without a clue.</li> <li>There seems to be a lot of worrying about how code written for Mozilla can be made backward-compatible with Communicator 4... which is exactly what I would hope to avoid.</li> <li>My <a href="http://www.evolt.org/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=741&catid=20">earlier post</a> completely ignored the role of the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/" target="_new">Web Standards Project</a> (WSP).  The omission was deliberate, and in truth I rather suspect that the happiness of the WSP has hardly been on the radar of the folks who coordinate and contribute to the Mozilla build.  At the same time, I failed to give credit where it was due.</li></ul> <p>Another question has to do with the average skill level of the developers out there.  If the developers who <i>can</i> write cutting-edge sites take an action such as the one I've proposed, will folks actually notice?</p> <p>Any follow-up on these points is more than welcome.</p> <P> <P> <P> <P> <P> <P>
