<h2>An Overview of Personas</h2></p><p>One of the most important things you can do to help make your site more usable</p>  is to get to know your users. This can be done in various ways. Conducting</p>  usability tests (<a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Gorilla_Usability/4090/51076/index.html">gorilla</a> or more in-depth tests), soliciting user feedback,</p>  interviewing and surveying are all good ways of doing this, and there are many</p>  more. Once you get started, you will have a pretty good basis of information</p>  on your users to help you design and advocate for them.</p></p><p>You can further increase the usefulness of this information, as well as add</p>  to it, by creating personas for your users.</p></p><p>A persona is a user profile that you can use to help make design decisions,</p>  as well as use to aid you in other ways. These profiles are created from your</p>  knowledge of your users, usually knowledge gained from user testing and research.</p>  Think of it as having a &#8220;virtual&#8221; user to bounce ideas off and</p>  help you keep the goals of the user in mind on a day-to-day basis. They are</p>  another powerful and valuable tool you can add to your toolbox.</p></p><p>What I&#8217;ll do here is show you a quick and easy method to help</p>  you create your personas, as well as the basics of how they can be used. This</p>  is by no means going to be the only way this can be done, nor is it the only</p>  way personas can be used. There is much more to the world of personas than</p>  I&#8217;ll be discussing here.</p></p><p>The more you put into your personas (and any other usability strategy) the more you&#8217;ll</p>  get out of them &#8211; I just hope to get you started. To that end I&#8217;ll</p>  give you some links to resources that will explain in much more detail how</p>  you can use, create and learn from personas when we&#8217;re done.</p></p><h2>Start with Research. </h2></p><p>The first and most important thing you&#8217;ll need to do is gather information</p>  about your users. Depending on your resources and budget this can be done in</p>  various ways and to varying levels of detail. Let&#8217;s concentrate on a</p>  few simple ways that will specifically help you create personas.</p></p><p>One of the best ways you can get good information for your personas is by</p>  interviewing your users one on one. If you are planning on doing some usability</p>  testing, add ten minutes or so to users&#8217; sessions and have someone</p>  sit down and ask them some questions.  If you can&#8217;t get in direct contact</p>  with them, provide an survey (by email for example) for them to fill out</p>  and send to you. </p></p><p>It&#8217;s fairly important to get a decent sized sample of user data. What</p>  you&#8217;ll need to look for when building your personas is patterns or similarities</p>  between users. You&#8217;ll want to avoid keying in on one particular person</p>  for a persona.</p></p><p>Things you&#8217;ll want to find out about:</p></p><ul></p>  <li>Personal information, such as age, gender and location.</li></p>  <li>Technical information</p>    like what kind of computer and browser they use, how and why they use the</p>    Web, and how often.</li></p>  <li>Their relationship is to your company, client or organization.</li></p>  <li>How they</p>    view your site, or potential site, as well as those of your competitors.</li></p>  <li>What they like</p>    in a Web site and what they don&#8217;t.</li></p></ul></p><p>You don&#8217;t need to limit it to that, and this list should vary depending</p>  on the type of site you are building, your audiences and the business you are</p>  in. For example, I work for a children&#8217;s hospital, so when interviewing</p>  parents we asked some generic questions about their kids and their relationship</p>  with the hospital. All of that was very important when building our personas.</p></p><p>In addition to the interview data, you can gather some demographic type data</p>  from your server logs (technical), and by talking to stakeholders. A good group</p>  to speak with, as they will most likely have some of this, is your marketing</p>  department.</p></p><p>There are other ways to get information about your users that would be helpful</p>  in persona creation. Focus groups, emotional response testing, site feedback</p>  forms and surveys can all help you out.</p></p><p>Once you have gathered your data, and hopefully you will have enough to begin</p>  to see some patterns emerge, you&#8217;ll need to sort that data and summarize</p>  it for review. One thing you&#8217;ll want to keep in mind is to separate the</p>  patterns so that things that apply to the majority of users are not lumped</p>  in with patterns specific to single users or very few users. This way you&#8217;ll</p>  be able to identify a common or primary user base (and persona) as well as</p>  a secondary persona. More on that shortly.</p></p><h2>It&#8217;s alive! Time to Create.</h2></p><p>Now that you have gathered and grouped your data it&#8217;s time to create</p>  a few personas. There are many ways you can do this, all of them good. What</p>  I have personally found easiest is to create the personas myself, and not involve</p>  a group. This may not work well for you, however. Feel free to involve others</p>  if you need to.</p></p><p>I start with my raw data, and I take the groupings I&#8217;ve come up with</p>  and try to form that data into the traits of a person. I do this until my data</p>  is exhausted, or as close as I can get to that. This process will vary depending</p>  on the amount of data you have as well as the variety. Hopefully you will have</p>  a pretty decent understanding of your audiences and users through the process</p>  of gathering the data that will allow you to make some assumptions. Another</p>  way you can help yourself is try to find a few &#8220;real&#8221; people in</p>  your pool of data and model the personas after them. Do change the names to</p>  protect the innocent.</p></p><p>Once you have some personas mapped out with user data you can identify your</p>  primary and secondary user groups. Pretty much all that means is you&#8217;ll</p>  want to take the two personas that best describe who you think your largest</p>  user group and a secondary user group that is very different from the first</p>  but still very important.</p></p><p>At this point you should have a persona to represent the most common user</p>  group, a secondary persona to represent another vastly different group as well</p>  as a few other personas to fill in the rest of your user groups. You don&#8217;t</p>  want too many, so if you have quite a few, or any that overlap, either combine</p>  them or cut them.</p></p><p>If you like you can also get creative and create a back-story or add some</p>  personality to your personas. This can not only be fun, but also help you later</p>  on when working on real world problems.</p></p><h2>Put Your Personas to Work</h2></p><p>So now that you have personas, what do you do? Well, that is up to you and</p>  the needs of you and your team members. I use my personas for many things.</p>  Here&#8217;s a list to get you started thinking about how you (and others you</p>  work with) can use your personas:</p></p><ul></p>  <li>For surrogate user testing.</li></p>  <li>To help advocate for your users.</li></p>  <li>To communicate user needs.</li></p>  <li>To evaluate new features.</li></p>  <li>To help make design decisions.</li></p>  <li>To help weigh business decisions.</li></p>  <li>For task analysis and use cases.</li></p>  <li>For customer service scripts.</li></p></ul></p><p>There is a certain amount of role playing and make-believe involved when putting</p>  your personas into practice. However silly it may seem, just having the personas</p>  around will help you not only think more user- and customer- centric, but help</p>  communicate the wants and needs of your users to anyone who might not understand</p>  how those needs and wants can help everyone involved.</p></p><p>There is a whole lot more to personas than what I&#8217;ve talked about here.</p>  I&#8217;ve found them to be a very helpful and very interesting design tool,</p>  but that is only the beginning. If you want to learn more about personas here</p>  are some great resources. Some of these were instrumental in helping me get</p>  my first personas created.</p></p><h3>More persona resources:</h3></p><p><a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672316498/evoltorg02-20" </p>  target="_blank">The Inmates Are Running the Asylum</a>.
