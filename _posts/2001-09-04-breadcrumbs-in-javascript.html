to web design & coding. Justin\'s hobby became a career when
he was offered a junior web design position whilst chatting in an IRC channel. Having recently dropped out of a teaching degree
, he eagerly accepted the job.</P>

<P>Justin\'s natural curiosity and his hunger for knowledge have seen him play/work
with such technologies as
HTML,
XML,
VRML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
Flash,
Perl,
ASP,
Java,
JSP and
PHP.
Get him interested in a problem and he\'ll happily set about
solving it using whatever tools and technologies are available.</P>

<P>Although preferring coding over design, <a href=\"http://www.whitford.id.au/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Justin Whitford web developemt\" target=\"justin\">Justin</a> is comfortable with graphics/multimedia packages as varied as
Adobe Photoshop(v5/6), Micrographix Picture Publisher(v5), Macromedia Fireworks(v4/5), and Flash(v4/5). The open
source package, \"the GiMP\", is the latest to capture his attention.</P>

excerpt: "This script uses Javascript to display a breadcrumb navigational aid and can be used by those who don\'t have SSI or server-side scripting available to them."

<p></p>Those unfamiliar with the breadcrumb navigation concept should read MartinB's article, <a href="/article/Breadcrumbs_for_All/17/4428/">Breadcrumbs for All</a>, a great tutorial if you're using SSI. ASP people should read Aardvark's <a href="/article/Breadcrumbs_for_Those_Using_ASP/17/4438/">Breadcrumbs for Those Using ASP</a> and jstetser has written a nice PHP tutorial entitled <a href="/article/Breadcrumbs_for_PHP_Lovers/17/4455/">Breadcrumbs for PHP Lovers</a>.</p></p></p><p><h2>Why Javascript?</h2></p><p><p></p>Because I can. I know that being a client-side technology Javascript is bound to be less of a reliable tool than a server-side script that produces uncontroversial HTML, but it will work for 95% or more of internet users and, frankly, not everyone has server-side tools available to them.</p></p></p><p><p></p>All we're going to do here is grab the URL and cutting off the 1st 8 chars (allowing for http:// and https://). We then grab the next chunk up to a &quot;/&quot; and discard that (the domain name). Now, we grab all the remaining chunks between the &quot;/&quot characters and build the html string with them.</p></p></p><p><p></p>To use it, stick the function between your HEAD tags (or in a .js file) and then call it where you want the breadcrumbs to appear with &lt;script&gt;breadcrumbs()&lt;/script&gt;.</p></p></p><p><p></p>[Ed note: The following script will not degrade gracefully in pre-4.x browsers. Users of Javascript 1.0 and 1.1 will not see the navigation used below.  Instead, they will encounter JavaScript errors. However, this script is a good basis for accomplishing a breadcrumb navigation with Javascript on any site.]</p></p></p><p><P></p><pre></p>&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;</p>&lt;!--</p>  function breadcrumbs(){</p>    sURL = new String;</p>    bits = new Object;</p>    var x = 0;</p>    var stop = 0;</p>    var output = &quot;&lt;A HREF=\&quot;/\&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/A&gt;   &quot;;</p><p>    sURL = location.href;</p>    sURL = sURL.slice(8,sURL.length);</p>    chunkStart = sURL.indexOf(&quot;/&quot;);</p>    sURL = sURL.slice(chunkStart+1,sURL.length)</p><p>    while(!stop){</p>      chunkStart = sURL.indexOf(&quot;/&quot;);</p>      if (chunkStart != -1){</p>        bits[x] = sURL.slice(0,chunkStart)</p>        sURL = sURL.slice(chunkStart+1,sURL.length);</p>      }else{</p>        stop = 1;</p>      }</p>      x++;</p>    }</p><p>    for(var i in bits){</p>      output += &quot;&lt;A HREF=\&quot;&quot;;</p><p>      for(y=1;y&lt;x-i;y++){</p>        output += &quot;../&quot;;</p>      }</p>      output += bits[i] + &quot;/\&quot;&gt;&quot; + bits[i] + &quot;&lt;/A&gt;   &quot;;</p>    }</p>    document.write(output + document.title);</p>  }</p>// --&gt;</p>&lt;/script&gt;</p></pre></p></p>
