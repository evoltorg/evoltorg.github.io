<p>The <a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_new">Apache Group</a> is pleased to announce the release of the 1.3.14 version of the Apache HTTP</p>server. The main improvements in this release are to fix security vulnerabilities in the</p>mod_vhost_alias and mod_rewrite modules. Apache 1.3.14 is the best version of Apache currently</p>available; everyone running 1.2.X servers or earlier should upgrade to 1.3, as there will not be any</p>further 1.2.X releases. At present, the Win32 port of Apache is not as stable as the UNIX version.</p>The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are pleased to announce the</p>release of version 1.3.14 of the Apache HTTP server. Version 1.3.13 was never released.</p></p></p><p></p>This version of Apache is primarily a security fix and bug fix release, but there are a few new</p>features and improvements. A summary of the new features is given at the end of this document.</p></p></p><p></p>We consider Apache 1.3.14 to be the best version of Apache available and we strongly recommend</p>that users of older versions, especially of the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible. No</p>further releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.</p></p></p><p></p>Apache 1.3.14 is available for download from</p><p><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/dist/" target="_new">http://httpd.apache.org/dist/</a>.</p></p></p>
