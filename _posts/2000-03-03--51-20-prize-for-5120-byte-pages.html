Think you write neat, compact code? The <a href='http://www.sylloge.com/5k/' target='_blank'>5k competition</a> is now open for entries.</p><p>The idea is simple:         write the best page in under 5k with no server-side coding at all. Client side script & CSS files are fine, but all count toward the total. You get points for design, usefulness, and (of course) how small your project is.</p><p>Unlike the entries, the judges are no lightweights, and include<ul></p><li>Jeff Veen</p><li>Jeffrey Zeldman</p><li>Derek Sisson, User Experience Manager at Borders</p></ul></p><p>And the prize? 5k cents. That's US$51.20. And the honour, of course.
