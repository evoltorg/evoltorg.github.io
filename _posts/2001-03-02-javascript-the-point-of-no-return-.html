<h2>Question:</h2>\n<p>I'm not sure why the code I'm looking at has a <code>return</code> here?  I took the <code>return</code> out in a similar onclick event and it still worked fine.</p>\n<p><code>onclick="return openPartner(this)"</code></p>\n<h2>Answer:</h2>\n<p>The function the event handler was calling may not have been written to return a value.</p>\n<p>In order to understand why this is important though, I want to talk about the <code>return</code> statement in an event handler and what that accomplishes.  There are some event handlers that can be cancelled.  Canceling an event effectively renders the default behavior of the tag the event handler is attached to useless.  Take the following as an example:</p>\n<p><code><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/" onClick="return false">Yahoo</a></code></p>\n<p>When the behavior is run in your web browser you end up with something like this link that does absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/" onClick="return false">Yahoo</a></p>\n<p>You can click on the link all day long and go nowhere.  The statement <code>return false</code> is canceling the default behavior of the <code><a></code>, which is to navigate to the value of the href attribute.  This is a really simple example, but suffice to say, so long as the <code>return</code> statement is passing a boolean value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>), you can affect the behavior of the event handlers they are attached to.</p>\n<p>To take this into more worldly, practical example, let's consider a link to a rather large file.  Let's say we want to be able to warn the user when they click on that link and ask them if they really want to download that file.  We can do this using the <code>confirm()</code> dialogue.</p>\n<p>Let's look at an intermediary example to see how that works before moving on to the final solution.  This example will call the <code>confirm()</code> method and assign the value of the user's action (whether they click the OK button, returning a value of <code>true</code> from the <code>confirm()</code> method or they click the close or cancel button returning a value of <code>false</code> from the <code>confirm()</code> method) to a variable.  We will then use an <code>alert()</code> dialogue to display the value of this variable.</p>\n<p><code><a href="bigfile.zip" onClick="confirmDownload = confirm('Are you sure?'); alert(confirmDownload)">Download</a></code></p>\n<p>When the HTML is run in your web browser you end up with something like this link that when clicked displays first a <code>confirm()</code> dialogue and then an <code>alert()</code> dialogue containing the boolean returned by the <code>confirm()</code> dialogue.</p>\n<p><a href="bigfile.zip" onClick="confirmDownload = confirm('Are you sure?'); alert(confirmDownload)">Download</a></p>\n<p>Using the <code>return</code> statement within the event handler, we can alter the behavior of the &lt;a&gt; tag depending on what button the user clicks.  All we have to do is complete the <code>return</code> statement in the <code>onClick</code> event handler with a boolean which will be stored from <code>confirm()</code> dialogue in the <code>confirmDownload</code> variable.</p>\n<p><code><a href="bigfile.zip" onClick="confirmDownload=confirm('Are you sure?'); alert(confirmDownload); return confirmDownload">Download</a></code></p>\n<p>When the above is run, the following is produced:</p>\n<p><a href="bigfile.zip" onClick="confirmDownload = confirm('Are you sure?'); alert(confirmDownload); return confirmDownload">Download</a></p>\n<p>The <code>return</code> statement is looking for a boolean value (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, the same kind of value the <code>confirm()</code> dialogue returns).  Knowing this we can use the <code>confirm()</code> dialogue (and consequently the value it will return) as the boolean in the <code>return</code> statement for the event handler.</p>\n<p><code><a href="bigfile.zip" onClick="return confirm('Are you sure?')">Download</a></code></p>\n<p><a href="http://evolt.org/evolt/favicon.ico" onClick="return confirm('Are you sure?')">Download</a></p>\n<p>I hope that the use of the <code>return</code> statement makes a little more sense now.</p>\n<p><a href="/users/jeff/15/index.html">.jeff</a></p>
