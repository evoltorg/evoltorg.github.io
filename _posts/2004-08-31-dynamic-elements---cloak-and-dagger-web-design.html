<div id="collapsibles"></p>	<div id="preface"></p>		<p>There are not many aspects of web design that seem to ignite  </p>		the same fascination in developers as making elements dynamic by hiding </p>		and showing them on user interaction.</p></p>		<p>Collapsible lists, maps with hover elements and multi </p>		level drop-down navigations still seem to be hot and need to be part </p>		of a web site to make it &#34;cool&#34; and to &#34;increase usability&#34;.</p></p>		<p>Much like the magician conjuring the rabbit out of the top hat for the 10th time </p>		in a row this design stunt does gets a bit stale though.

That is what links were for, and </p>		interaction with them meant a new page was loaded.</p></p>		<p>In the olden days we were amazed to see a bunch of links in </p>		different states (link, active, visited) and we looked awe struck at </p>		a blurb of colour or a rectangle slowly turning into an image.</p></p>		<p>These restrictions and the simplicity also had its merits:</p></p>		<ul></p>			<li>Sites were designed to tell us at any stage of our journey where we </p>				are and where other pages with related content are - a static </p>				navigation on one spot.</li></p>			<li>The different link states made us realise where we have been </p>			already and what is new without any search effort.</li></p>			<li>Deep sites never dared to show us links not related to this </p>			sub section in the main navigation - the sitemap, the search and </p>			internal promotions fulfiled that job nicely.</li></p>		</ul></p>		<p>When <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> got </p>		supported and Javascript allowed us to modify elements and their </p>		<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> attributes </p>		&#34;<acronym title="Dynamic Hyper Text Markup Language">DHTML</acronym>&#34; </p>		was born.</p> </p>		<p>&#34;<acronym title="Dynamic Hyper Text Markup Language">DHTML</acronym>&#34; </p>		is not a standard, it is a marketing word, and there was a time when a </p>		new site needed to have a </p>		&#34;<acronym title="Dynamic Hyper Text Markup Language">DHTML</acronym>&#34; </p>		intro and elements, or else it would not show up in the &#34;cool pages&#34;</p>		lists of our web world. Browser shortcomings and newly emerging browsers </p>		triggering the need to change the scripts over and over again soon made </p>		it transparent though that </p>		&#34;<acronym title="Dynamic Hyper Text Markup Language">DHTML</acronym>&#34; </p>		was just not reliable enough. These incompatibilities and the high maintenance</p>		made many an obtrusive and badly designed web site go the way of the Dodo </p>		bird. We are now at a stage where we can create some of these effects </p>		in <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> only, and our </p>		Javascript skills have become </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/">more sophisticated</a><span class="print">[1]</span>. </p>		We can test if a browser supports a certain technique before we apply it,</p>		and we have browsers that are more sophisticated and standards-literate</p>		at our disposal.</p></p>		<h3>The origin of dynamic elements</h3></p>		<p>Hiding and showing elements on user interaction originates from application</p>		design. Applications become more usable by not showing us all their options at </p>		once but allowing us to turn them off and on. Furthermore, we can arrange </p>		the elements freely on the screen and the application &#34;remembers&#34;</p>		their state and location when we end it.</p></p>		<p>Application design offers a much richer interface than web design to </p>		allow for these usability enhancements. An HTML page is a document, and </p>		resides inside several applications - the operating system, the browser </p>		and, if needed, an assistive technology like a screen reader. </p>		What makes it worse is that we don't know which applications are used, and </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html">trying </p>		to guess which ones they are</a><span class="print"> [2]</span></p>		is flaky at best if not impossible.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>	</div></p>	<div id="demands"></p>		<h2>The perfect dynamic elements solution</h2></p>		<p>A perfect dynamic elements solution should be unobtrusive and accessible:</p></p>		<ul></p>			<li>It should only apply itself when it can be applied to avoid hiding </p>			elements that cannot be shown again.</li></p>			<li>It should be independent of input device</li></p>			<li>It should enhance existing markup rather than creating crucial </p>			content via <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> or Javascript.</li></p>		</ul></p>		<p>These are the basic <a href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12">legal </p>		requirements</a><span class="print"> [3]</span>, but a out solution should also offer a bit more usability.</p></p>		<h3>Maintaining the current state</h3></p>		<p>If possible, our solution should store the users' current status. </p>		Typically a hiding and showing solution initialises the page every time </p>		the browser loads the page. All elements that are to be hidden get hidden, which </p>		can be pretty annoying when you reloaded the page without wanting to. These </p>		unwanted reloads happen	a lot when we use collapsible elements to </p>		simulate a whole web site in one document &#34;to avoid long loading times&#34;.</p> </p>		<p>As a web user who had to suffer badly designed pages for years we got </p>		used to going back to the previous page when we ended up on a wrong one </p>		either via the &#34;back&#34; button or the equivalent keyboard shortcut - </p>		not via the navigation - thus initialising all hidden elements. This </p>		can only be prevented by storing the current state in a session, database</p>		or cookie.</p> </p>		<h3>Telling the users where they are</h3></p>		<p>Our solution should make sure that users get the information where </p>		they are in the page hierarchy at any point, the &#34;you are here&#34; </p>		effect of the boring old text links.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>	</div>	</p>	<div id="current"></p>		<h2>Current problems of collapsible elements</h2></p>		<div id="contentoverload"></p>		<h3>&#34;Three clicks&#34; vs. &#34;content overload&#34;</h3></p>		<p>When talking to clients and designers about collapsible navigations </p>		we will sooner or later stumble over the &#34;</p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uie.com/articles/three_click_rule/">three </p>		clicks rule</a>&#34;<span class="print">[4]</span>. </p>		This rule states that users should find any content on your page with </p>		three clicks (otherwise they get bored and fed up and leave your site </p>		to spend millions on your competitors' sites).</p> </p>		<p>This rule does not state that the three clicks should happen in the </p>		same document and without a page load in between. Therefore we can </p>		satisfy it by adding a sitemap to our site, and voil&#224;, two clicks </p>		and users can go anywhere on the page.</p></p>		<p>Of course this does not apply to a product catalogue, the three click</p>		rule needs to apply to the sub section you are in there.</p></p>		<p>Multi level foldout menus replicating a sitemap do allow the user to </p>		go anywhere on the site from any page. For a sighted user with scripting </p>		and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> turned on </p>		this can be very convenient (granted the navigation is easy to use and </p>		does not require neurosurgeon hand-eye coordination skills), but what </p>		is shown on our screen is not everybody's experience.</p></p>		<p>By adding the link data of the whole site to each page, we create a </p>		&#34;content overload&#34;. Depending on the depth of our site, the </p>		user might see a nested list of 50 links, and will have to cope with this</p>		amount of data. Sighted users who can use a mouse might not have a </p>		problem with that, but keyboard and screen reader users will have to </p>		navigate through these links one at a time.</p> </p>		<p>This can be a quite infuriating experience when you want to read </p>		link 28 and link 29 afterwards - it means hitting tab 28 times, reading, </p>		waiting for the page to load and hitting tab 29 times, repeated ad nauseam.</p></p>		<p>Some browsers have </p>		&#34;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/typeaheadfind.html">type ahead</a>&#34;<span class="print">[5]</span> </p>		functionality that jumps to a link when you type a word contained in it, </p>		and speech recognition systems can number the links for you. Regardless of </p>		these handy extensions, we still create a whole load of content </p>		that is not really relevant to this section of the site. A real world </p>		equivalent would be to print the register of a catalogue on each of its </p>		pages.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>		</div></p>		<div id="screenestate"></p>		<h3>Troubles with available screen estate</h3></p>		<p>One of the main reasons for using hidden elements is that you do </p>		not clatter your pages with text and navigation elements and that the </p>		user does not get confused by too many options at once. Unless we hide </p>		and show these elements via a reload, this does not apply to everybody. </p>		If we use Javascript or <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> </p>		to show and hide elements, we should make sure that the amount </p>		of content is not too overwhelming when all elements are visible.</p></p>		<p>This is especially important when we use multi level foldout menus, as these</p>		can become unusable when they exceed the available space.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>		</div></p>		<div id="mouse"></p>		<h3>Mouse dependence</h3></p>		<p>Hiding and showing page elements is a visual stunt (unless we do it </p>		on the backend and only write out the elements when they are visible),</p>		and thus we are tempted not to require a click to activate it but use </p>		a smoother way: The hover. This event takes place when the pointing device</p>		of the user is on the element but does not activate it. According to the </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#dynamic-pseudo-classes">CSS specifications</a> </p>		<span class="print">[6]</span> interactive user agents should support </p>		that, but may not be able to.</p> </p>		<p>With the browsers currently available there is no reliable way to </p>		trigger a hover state with a keyboard. This means that a lot of </p>		well thought CSS-only solutions are dependent on a mouse or other </p>		pointing device. Even more annoying is the fact that the focus and </p>		active states, which by definition allow keyboard events and are the </p>		<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> equivalent of an </p>		onclick event are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/hover.html">not </p>		supported properly by some browsers</a><span class="print">[7]</span>.</p></p>		<p>&#34;Users without a mouse most probably have </p>		<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> turned off, too&#34; </p>		is a nice idea to reassure ourself that we did well, but does not quite </p>		cut it.</p>		</p>		<p>One possible life saver is the </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#adef-accesskey">accesskey attribute</a> </p>		<span class="print">[8]</span> and a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/accesskeys/">accessibility tutorials</a> </p>		<span class="print">[9]</span> swear by it - after all the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#link-accesskey">accessibility recommendations</a></p><span class="print">[10]</span> promote it and some accessibility certifications even require them.</p></p>		<p>Much like the </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#directly-accessible-scripts">recommendations </p>		for scripting</a><span class="print"> [11]</span>, </p>		they appear great on paper (or on screen), but when we try to </p>		implement accesskey we run into some issues. First of all there is no </p>		indicator as to what the accesskey associated with the element is, as </p>		not all browsers or agents display them. This is a folly of the browsers </p>		and should not really be our problem, but if we use accesskey as the </p>		mean for keyboard users to use our solution, they should be made aware </p>		of that. Another issue is that there are not many keyboard shortcuts left</p>		at our disposal. The browser is already running inside several </p>		applications, all of them with their own set of keyboard shortcuts. By </p>		following the recommendations, we might </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.wats.ca/articles/accesskeys/19">overwrite </p>		some of their important functionality</a><span class="print"> [12]</span>.</p></p>		<p>Any way we look at it, the only reliable solution to allow elements to be</p>		shown and hidden and remain independent of input device is by relying on</p>		the onclick event - as boring as that may seem. What scripting and the </p>		onclick event does allow us is to only apply the effect when it can </p>		be used: Rather than adding the script calls in the markup and guessing </p>		the script is available, we add the functionality via scripting.</p>		</p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>		</div></p>	</div></p>	<div id="solutions"></p>		<h2>Hiding and showing solutions currently in use</h2></p>		<p>Let us take a look at the pros and cons and the feasibility of </p>		different solutions to turn page elements into dynamic ones. We will </p>		focus on what is the best practise for these, taking into consideration both </p>		accessibility and usability.</p></p>		<div id="foldout"></p>		<h3>Foldout or Dropdown navigations</h3></p>		<p>This type of navigation is the most common use of hidden elements, a navigation </p>		on the top or the left of the page which acts like the menus of applications </p>		or the windows start menu. The sub menus are positioned over the content and </p>		do not cause the rest of the content to shift when being expanded.</p></p>		<p>If we use this kind of navigation, we need to be aware of several problems:</p></p>		<h4>1. Content overload</h4></p>		<p>If we use the whole sitemap as a navigation on each page, we do exactly what </p>		was explained earlier. Too many irrelevant links for this section will confuse </p>		users and the extra markup will slow down the page.</p></p>		<h4>2. No &#34;you are here&#34; state</h4></p>		<p>As the whole navigation collapses once users have chosen a page, there is</p>		no indicator as to where they are in the site, how many other elements there </p>		are in the same section and how many levels deep they are. We need to make them </p>		aware in another way (breadcrumbs, repeating the section navigation in a visible </p>		way).</p></p>		<h4>3. Screen estate restrictions</h4></p>		<p>The worst thing that can happen with a multi level drop-down menu is that it </p>		doesn't fit the screen and either cuts off options or causes a scrollbar.</p></p>		<img src="http://www.zen32721.zen.co.uk/dropdowns.gif" width="505" height="119" alt="Illustration of three different states of a multi level dropdown navigation" border="0" /></p>		<p>State 1 does not pose a problem, State 2 makes it impossible for a </p>		sighted user to know what the options are and State 3 might make it impossible to </p>		use the menu. When the menu causes a scrollbar, and the menu hides and shows itself </p>		on hover rather than click, it gets hidden when the user tries to reach the </p>		scrollbar. This can become pretty frustrating.</p></p>		<p>To avoid these issues, we need to fix the page dimensions and check </p>		if all menus fit the screen when expanded to the last level. As we cannot</p>		know the size of the users browser - which can be different to the </p>		screen resolution - this poses other usability and accessibility problems.</p></p>		<p>One annoying browser bug we have to be aware of is that some browsers </p>		show flash movies and form elements on top of the menus instead of being </p>		covered by them. There is a </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://homepage.mac.com/igstudio/design/ulsmenus/vertical-uls-iframe.html">work-around </p>		using an IFRAME</a><span class="print"> [13]</span>, </p>		but that is hardly accessible. The safest bet is to ensure that the </p>		space all the expanded elements cover is free of multimedia elements, </p>		forms and - of course - frames.</p></p>		</p>		<h4>4. Mouse dependence</h4></p>		<p>A foldout menu has to be navigable via keyboard to remain accessible. </p>		Therefore it should expand and collapse when the user clicks it, for reasons</p>		explained earlier. This is less sexy and does not give the same experience</p>		as an application menu, but web development is just not application development.</p></p>		<p>Many foldout menus using hover to trigger the sub menus can even get </p>		mouse users into real trouble. Examples are menus that don't allow for </p>		a big enough space to hover over or show gaps in between menu and sub </p>		menu. It is pretty frustrating to navigate down into the third level </p>		just to see the menu vanish again when you slipped a bit.</p></p><p>		<h4>5. Unknown functionality</h4></p>		<p>When we use foldout navigations then we should make users aware that there </p>		are more options to come when they activate this link. </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uie.com/articles/users_decide_first/">Studies have shown</a></p>		<span class="print">[14]</span>,</p>		that if users don't get that information, they won't use the navigation </p>		and get	easily lost - rendering our whole effort to increase </p>		usability pointless.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>		</div></p>		<div id="explorer"></p>		<h3>Explorer Menus (collapsible list navigations)</h3></p>		<p>Explorer tree menus are vertical list menus that expand and collapse the </p>		sub-menus when you click their parent element - much like the explorer tree on </p>		windows showing sub-folders and programs when you click on a folder name. While </p>		posing less problems than a foldout menu, there are still some pitfalls to avoid.</p></p>		<h4>1. Content overload</h4></p>		<p>The rules of &#34;content overload&#34; apply here, the user may be </p>		confused or even annoyed by the amount of links not related to this section.</p></p>		<h4>2. Not maintaining the current state</h4></p>		<p>A good explorer navigation should keep the current section expanded when </p>		the page loads - something that can be easily achieved. As the current </p>		sub section stays visible after choosing an element, highlighting this </p>		element and keeping a visited state should also be no big issue.</p></p>		<h4>3. Mouse dependence</h4></p>		<p>Expanding and collapsing the elements on hover is not possible without</p>		trading off keyboard users. Therefore we should stick to clicking the </p>		menu sections to expand  sub-elements. As the menu items are arranged </p>		vertically, expanding the sub sections when hovering over each of the </p>		parent elements could appear rather annoying. Users want to reach link </p>		number 5, not expand and collapse all sub-menus in between 1 and 5 </p>		before reaching it.</p></p>		</p>		<h4>4. Unknown functionality</h4></p>		<p>Elements that have sub elements should tell the user so, to avoid </p>		frustration loading a page when in reality there was a shortcut. We should make</p>		sure that this highlighting is only applied when the solution is working.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>		</div></p>		<div id="elements"></p>		<h3>Collapsible page elements</h3></p>		<p>One not that common enhancement is to only show and hide certain parts </p>		of the page, for example a right hand extra navigation or extra </p>		information in a list of products.</p></p>		<p>Unless we add extra information this way, we don't have a case of content </p>		overload. The only remaining things to keep in mind are:</p></p>		<h4>1. Not maintaining the current state</h4></p>		<p>Once users chose to hide or show a certain page element, they should not </p>		have to repeat their decision on each page. We should ensure the state is </p>		kept in a cookie or some other mean of data storage.</p></p>		<h4>2. Jumpy display</h4></p>		<p>Unless we show and hide the element via including it or not on the backend, </p>		there will be a brief moment when the element is visible before it gets hidden. </p>		This is nothing serious, but users can be confused and annoyed.</p></p>		<h4>3. Unknown functionality</h4></p>		<p>We need to tell users that they can hide and show this part of </p>		the page, or that there is extra information.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>		</div></p>		<div id="tooltips"></p>		<h3>Tooltips and hidden extra information</h3></p>		<p>One example of hidden and shown elements are &#34;tooltips&#34; that </p>		appear when you hover over a navigation or an imagemap. </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.meyerweb.com">Eric Meyer</a><span class="print"> [15]</span> </p>		lead the way for this functionality with his </p>		&#34;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html">CSS </p>		only popups&#34;</a><span class="print"> [16]</span> </p>		which turned out </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/ie6_purecsspopups.html">not </p>		to work on some browsers unless you create your <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> the right way</a><span class="print"> [17]</span>. </p>		They also have some other problems:</p></p>		<h4>1. Content overload</h4></p>		<p>As these tooltips re-use already existing markup, there shouldn't be any</p>		content overload. We simply need to turn off </p>		<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> or scripting to see if the </p>		extra information is really helping or just represents a &#34;nice to have&#34;. </p>		</p></p>		<p>For example, a navigation with spans inside each link which get positioned </p>		and shown outside the link via <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> </p>		can be a nice effect, but the same amount of text in each link might </p>		render the navigation hard to follow. HTML already has the title </p>		attribute for extra information that could be </p>		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/nicetitle/">displayed as a tooltip</a>																	<span class="print"> [18]</span>.</p></p>		<h4>2. Mouse independence</h4></p>		<p>Per definition, these effects are mouse over effects. However, as they are </p>		an enhancement and not a necessity, not much is lost if they don't work with </p>		alternative access.</p></p>		<h4>3.Giving false hope</h4></p>		<p>One common mistake is to style the tool tips as if they </p>		were clickable and yet hiding and showing them with a hover effect. Users will</p>		try to reach the tips with their mouse and get frustrated when they vanish.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>		</div></p><p>		<div id="internal"></p>		<h3>Enhanced internal navigation</h3></p>		<p>Scripting is often used to enhance &#34;internal</p>		navigation&#34; - a list of links pointing to anchors inside the </p>		same document. We can use scripting to hide content parts and show </p>		them when the user clicks the link, thus avoiding a long scrolling page. </p>		Effectively, we are simulating a site navigation in one document, which </p>		creates other problems:</p></p>		<h4>1. Changing user behaviour patterns</h4></p>		<p>As mentioned earlier, a wrong jump in a simulated paged navigation </p>		like this might make the user try to go back via the back button or the </p>		appropriate keyboard shortcut. This will initialise - hide all elements, </p>		and show the first one - not the last one the user has chosen. There is </p>		not much we can do about that except for making the user aware that </p>		this is not a &#34;site inside one document&#34;.</p></p>		<h4>2. Disallowing bookmarking and direct linking</h4></p>		<p>User won't be able to bookmark a certain section of the document, and </p>		some browsers do not change the state of the links to visited once you</p>		jumped to this section. A good scripting solution should allow the </p>		user to directly jump in the page by supplying the anchor in the URL:</p></p>		<p>http://www.foo.org/index.html#bar</p></p>		<p>Furthermore, we could trace the clicks and set a cookie to show </p>		the last section when the user visits the page again.</p></p>		<h4>3. Jumpy display</h4></p>		<p>Unless we show and hide the element via including it or not on the backend, </p>		there will be a brief moment when the element is visible before it gets hidden. </p>		This is nothing serious, but can be annoying.</p></p>		<h4>4. Cutting off content</h4></p>		<p>By hiding different content sections and showing them onclick we make </p>		it easier to read the document on the screen. Some users, however, may </p>		want to print out or see the whole document. We should give them an option </p>		to do so.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>		</div></p>	</div></p>	<div id="conclusion"></p>		<h2>Conclusion</h2></p>		<p>Wrapping up, it can be said that it is very easy to use hidden elements </p>		in a way that makes them more of a burden than a blessing. This applies </p>		especially to elements that are hidden and shown when the user hovers over</p>		other elements, which is a shame, because it makes the page appear a </p>		lot more interactive. Clicking elements is already known to navigate</p>		to other pages or sending off form data. When we change this behaviour</p>		to make our solution more reliable, we change patterns the users </p>		already follow without needing to think about what they do.</p></p>		<p>As we don't know the users' setup and their abilities we cannot create a </p>		bullet-proof solution. Browser bugs add their share to render </p>		theoretically perfect solutions unusable. For the time being, we have </p>		to live with the certainty that we will repell possible users </p>		when we create dynamic page elements. It is up to us to judge if the </p>		benefits of them are worth that. Best case scenario would be to allow the user </p>		to turn off the solution via a page control.</p></p>		<p class="back"><a href="/Dynamic_Elements_cloak_and_dagger_web_design#nav">Back to menu</a></p></p>	</div></p>	<div id="links"></p>		<h2>Links</h2></p>		<ul></p>			<li><span class="print">[1]</span> Unobtrusive Javascript self training course: <a href="http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/" target="_bla nk">http://www.onlinetools.org/articles/unobtrusivejavascript/</a></li></p>			<li><span class="print">[2]</span> Browser detection via Javascript: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html</a></li></p>			<li><span class="print">[3]</span> Legal accessibility requirements: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&#38;ID=12">http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&#38;ID=12</a></li></p>			<li><span class="print">[4]</span> Debunking the &#34;3 clicks&#34; myth: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uie.com/articles/three_click_rule/">http://www.uie.com/articles/three_click_rule/</a></li></p>			<li><span class="print">[5]</span> &#34;Type ahead&#34; functionality in Mozilla <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/typeaheadfind.html">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ ui/accessibility/typeaheadfind.html</a></li></p>			<li><span class="print">[6]</span> Pseudo class <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> specifications: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#dynamic-pseudo-classes">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#dynamic-pseudo-classes</a></li></p>			<li><span class="print">[7]</span> Hover and Active problems <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/hover.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/css/hover.html</a></li></p>		<li><span class="print">[8]</span> Accesskey HTML specifications: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#adef-accesskey">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#adef-accesskey</a></li> </p>		</p>		<li><span class="print">[9]</span> Accesskey tutorial: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/accesskeys/">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/accesskeys/</a></li> </p><p>		<li><span class="print">[10]</span> Web accessibility guidelines on accesskey: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#link-accesskey">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#link-accesskey</a></li></p>		</p>		<li><span class="print">[11]</span> Accessible scripts guidelines: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#directly-accessible-scripts">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#directly-accessible-scripts</a></li></p> </p>		<li><span class="print">[12]</span> Problems with access keys: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wats.ca/articles/accesskeys/19">http://www.wats.ca/articles/accesskeys/19</a></li></p><p>		<li><span class="print">[13]</span>	Form elements covering menus in IE hack: <a target="_blank" href="http://homepage.mac.com/igstudio/design/ulsmenus/vertical-uls-iframe.html">http://homepage.mac.com/igstudio/design/ulsmenus/vertical-uls-iframe.html</a></li></p><p>		<li><span class="print">[14]</span> Usability study on dropdown navigations: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uie.com/articles/users_decide_first/">http://www.uie.com/articles/users_decide_first/</a></li></p><p>		<li><span class="print">[15]</span> Eric Meyer, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> expert: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meyerweb.com">http://www.meyerweb.com</a></li> </p>		</p>		<li><span class="print">[16]</span> Pure <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> popups: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html">http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html</a></li>  </p>		</p>		<li><span class="print">[17]</span> Problems with pure <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> popups<a target="_blank" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/ie6_purecsspopups.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/css/ie6_purecsspopups.html</a></li></p>		</p>		<li><span class="print">[18]</span> Nice titles: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/nicetitle/">http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/nicetitle/</a></li>																			</p>		</ul></p>	</div></p>	</div></p>	<div class="break">&#160;</div></p></div>
