<p>\n    (terms used, links and metadata about this article at the bottom)\n</p>\n<h2>The problem </h2>\n<p>\n    Web documents lack metadata. \n</p>\n<p>\n    Sure, some sites use some of the metatags, and the title tag gets used a lot, but even this limited amount of metadata is poorly defined (what is supposed to go in that title tag anyway?) and poorly used. \n</p>\n<p>\n    This lack of metadata makes it really hard to search the web, and limits it's use. It's really hard to search for <q>related documents</q> for example.\n</p>\n<h2>The solution </h2>\n<p>\n    The core of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) metadata vision is a concept known as the Semantic Web. The semantic web means that all the stuff out there has metadata with it that describes it. </p>\n<p>\n    But is the W3C then going to define thousands of metatags for every possible subject? Don't think so, Jose.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Enter the Resource Description Framework (RDF).\n</p>\n<p>\n    The resource description Framework is an XML-like standard for defining vocabularies that define metadata.</p>\n<p>\n    These vocabularies can then be used to describe documents. There already are a bunch of vocabularies out there (mostly for describing books), that can be used, but anyone could invent a new one. Market forces decide which ones get popular.\n</p>\n<h2>The future </h2>\n<p>\n    This is all of little consequence to web developers right now. But anyone involved in content management should watch this space, interesting times are ahead.\n</p>\n<h2>Terms used</h2>\n<p>\n    Metadata: metadata is data about data. I'll illustrate with a few examples: \n  the author of a book is metadata. The category a library classifies a book in \n  is metadata about that book. The title argument of an <a ...> tag is metadata. \n</p>\n    <h2>Related links:</h2>\n    <h3>The power of metadata</h3>\n<p>\n  <a href="http://openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/01/18/metadata.html" title="Opens in a new window" target="_foo">http://openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/01/18/metadata.htm</a>l<br>\n  (a really good introduction at <a href="http://p2p.com" title="Opens in a new window" target="_foo">http://p2p.com</a>) \n</p>\n<h3>What is RDF?</h3>\n<p>\n  <a href="http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2001/01/24/rdf.html " title="Opens in a new window" target="_foo">http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2001/01/24/rdf.html</a> <br>\n  (really good as well at <a href="http://xml.com" title="Opens in a new window" target="_foo">http://xml.com</a>) \n</p>\n<p><strong>Some metadata about this article</strong> (you may have noticed, more is provided by evolt): \n</p>\n<p>\n    <q>Author</q>: Peter Van Dijck, aka pedrito <br>\n  (for example, for meta data on the author, click on the author link at the top of the article) \n  <br>\n  <q>Title</q>: Introduction to metadata and the semantic web. <br>\n  <q>Inspiration</q>: the above articles <br>\n  <q>Date of writing</q>: Friday, January 2001 <br>\n  <q>keywords</q>: metadata, semantic web, p2p, Resource Description Framework, rdf, xml, content management.\n</p>
