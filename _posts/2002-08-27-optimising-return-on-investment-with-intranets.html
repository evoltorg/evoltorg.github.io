<h2>Introduction\n      </h2>\n      An intranet is a private network that is contained within an enterprise.\n      It may consist of many interlinked local area networks and also use\n      leased lines in the Wide Area Network. An extranet is also a private\n      network, however it shares part of a business's information or operations\n      with suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, or other businesses.<br>\n      <br>\n       \n      <p>\n          Intranets can serve large international organisations and\n         small-to-medium enterprises (MKB). The functionalities within an\n         intranet can include information delivery, training, employee\n         self-service and human resources. A recent Forrester study that 67% of\n         Fortune 1000 companies have an intranet of some form.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          There is no industry standard for the definition of 'Return on\n         Investment' (ROI) in eBusiness. A summary of most approaches is ROI a\n         measure of money collected to money spent adjusted over time. If you\n         spend $12,000 and collected $24,000 over one year the ROI is 100% for\n         a single year. More complicated factors such as interest and\n         depreciation must also be considered in the equation. The quality of\n         the metrics and accounting formulas are critical in developing\n         realistic and valuable numbers. Without quality metrics, the exercise\n         of determining ROI is pointless.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          ROI is different to cost amortisation. Why? ROI is concerned with\n         improving a company's bottom line; not spreading costs over time and\n         throughout company divisions.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          Intranet and Extranet ROI can be structured into two hard metrics and\n         soft metrics categories. Hard metrics are defined by clear financial\n         numbers and arrived at by formulas i.e. &euro;200,000. A soft metric\n         is defined as a measurement of 'perceived' benefit i.e. 22%\n         improvement in staff attitudes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          The ownership of ROI figures within an orginisation should be equally\n         shared amongst sales, IT and Finance divisions. The result of shared\n         ownership has many advantages - realistic numbers, improved delivery\n         and better company-wide awareness.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          ROI with intranets and extranets can be hard to determine. Many of\n         the benefits fall into the 'soft' category and therefore lack the\n         weight of clear revenue improvements. However, there is much evidence\n         to suggest the real impact intranets and extranets can have.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          Intranet and Extranet environments can create value for organisations\n         in a number of ways. A company can increase sales, decrease costs,\n         improve productivity, improve customer service and build intellectual\n         capital. Understanding the ROI can inform organisations on the best\n         way to invest in their Intranets and Extranets.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          The aim of this paper is to outline how companies improve ROI with\n         Intranets and Extranets. The case studies can be a starting point for\n         your company to understand its potential ROI with intranets and\n         extranets.\n      </p>\n      <h2>\n         Decreasing Costs\n      </h2>\n      <p>\n         Intranets and extranets can simply reduce the expense of information\n         delivery within an orginisation. Printing and distribution costs can\n         reduce significantly via online delivery of information.\n      </p>\n      <h3>\n         Polymerland Case Study\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n         Polymerland was formed to offer engineering resins, commodities,\n         custom compounds and colorants from the industry's leading\n         manufacturers through a network of distribution centers and supporting\n         warehouses, strategically located to serve customers around the\n         country.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n         The first web site to operate for Polymerland was its public web site\n         in 1997. This was a simple and static web site. However by 1999 a\n         transactional extranet was added. This enabled the connection between\n         the company and its customers. Despite initial sales of $10,000 per\n         week, sales within two years have reached $50 million to $60 million\n         each week - accounting for 60% of company orders.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          Developing a new sales channel really had impact on the bottom-line.\n         The customer service division of Polymerland has reduced costs by 35%\n         and the company receives 200,000 fewer telephone calls from its\n         customers.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          For information regarding Polymerland visit \n		  <a href="http://www.gepolymerlandeurope.com" target="_blank" \n		  title="Opens in a new window">http://www.gepolymerlandeurope.com</a>\n      </p>\n      <h3>\n         Cisco Systems Case Study\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n          Cisco Systems, Inc. is the worldwide leader in networking for the\n         Internet. Cisco's Internet Protocol-based (IP) networking solutions\n         are the foundation of the Internet and most corporate, education, and\n         government networks around the world.

This employee tool enabled cost reduction but also improved\n         efficiency. All employees can submit their personal business expenses\n         via the intranet Cisco's METRO expense reporting application has\n         reduced the cost of processing expense reports (compared to the\n         traditional paper system) from US$50.69 in 1996 to $1.90 in 1999.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          Beautiful in its simplicity and powerful in its benefits. METRO\n         translates into a 96% reduction in costs or US$77 million annually.\n         Also gained was the average processing time of expenses was reduced\n         from 21 days to only 4 days.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n          For information regarding Cisco visit <a href="http://www.cisco.com"\n         target="_blank" name="Opens in a new window">http://www.cisco.com</a>\n      </p>\n      <h3>\n         Productivity Increases\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n          Information is an important tool in everyday business. The\n         company-wide access to information can determine the success of sales,\n         time-to-market, customer service and many other mission critical\n         operations. Intranets and Extranets can, when built with the users\n         needs in mind, improve this information delivery process. Productivity\n         can also be improved with faster and more efficient processing of\n         transactions and orders.\n      </p>\n      <h3>\n         Eli Lilly Case Study\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n         Eli Lilly and Company is a leader in the pharmaceutical industry.
