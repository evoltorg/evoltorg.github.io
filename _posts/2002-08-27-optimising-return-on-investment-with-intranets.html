<h2>Introduction</p>      </h2></p>      An intranet is a private network that is contained within an enterprise.</p>      It may consist of many interlinked local area networks and also use</p>      leased lines in the Wide Area Network. An extranet is also a private</p>      network, however it shares part of a business's information or operations</p>      with suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, or other businesses.<br></p>      <br></p>       </p>      <p></p>          Intranets can serve large international organisations and</p>         small-to-medium enterprises (MKB). The functionalities within an</p>         intranet can include information delivery, training, employee</p>         self-service and human resources. A recent Forrester study that 67% of</p>         Fortune 1000 companies have an intranet of some form.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          There is no industry standard for the definition of 'Return on</p>         Investment' (ROI) in eBusiness. A summary of most approaches is ROI a</p>         measure of money collected to money spent adjusted over time. If you</p>         spend $12,000 and collected $24,000 over one year the ROI is 100% for</p>         a single year. More complicated factors such as interest and</p>         depreciation must also be considered in the equation. The quality of</p>         the metrics and accounting formulas are critical in developing</p>         realistic and valuable numbers. Without quality metrics, the exercise</p>         of determining ROI is pointless.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          ROI is different to cost amortisation. Why? ROI is concerned with</p>         improving a company's bottom line; not spreading costs over time and</p>         throughout company divisions.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          Intranet and Extranet ROI can be structured into two hard metrics and</p>         soft metrics categories. Hard metrics are defined by clear financial</p>         numbers and arrived at by formulas i.e. &euro;200,000. A soft metric</p>         is defined as a measurement of 'perceived' benefit i.e. 22%</p>         improvement in staff attitudes.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          The ownership of ROI figures within an orginisation should be equally</p>         shared amongst sales, IT and Finance divisions. The result of shared</p>         ownership has many advantages - realistic numbers, improved delivery</p>         and better company-wide awareness.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          ROI with intranets and extranets can be hard to determine. Many of</p>         the benefits fall into the 'soft' category and therefore lack the</p>         weight of clear revenue improvements. However, there is much evidence</p>         to suggest the real impact intranets and extranets can have.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          Intranet and Extranet environments can create value for organisations</p>         in a number of ways. A company can increase sales, decrease costs,</p>         improve productivity, improve customer service and build intellectual</p>         capital. Understanding the ROI can inform organisations on the best</p>         way to invest in their Intranets and Extranets.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          The aim of this paper is to outline how companies improve ROI with</p>         Intranets and Extranets. The case studies can be a starting point for</p>         your company to understand its potential ROI with intranets and</p>         extranets.</p>      </p></p>      <h2></p>         Decreasing Costs</p>      </h2></p>      <p></p>         Intranets and extranets can simply reduce the expense of information</p>         delivery within an orginisation. Printing and distribution costs can</p>         reduce significantly via online delivery of information.</p>      </p></p>      <h3></p>         Polymerland Case Study</p>      </h3></p>      <p></p>         Polymerland was formed to offer engineering resins, commodities,</p>         custom compounds and colorants from the industry's leading</p>         manufacturers through a network of distribution centers and supporting</p>         warehouses, strategically located to serve customers around the</p>         country.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>         The first web site to operate for Polymerland was its public web site</p>         in 1997. This was a simple and static web site. However by 1999 a</p>         transactional extranet was added. This enabled the connection between</p>         the company and its customers. Despite initial sales of $10,000 per</p>         week, sales within two years have reached $50 million to $60 million</p>         each week - accounting for 60% of company orders.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          Developing a new sales channel really had impact on the bottom-line.</p>         The customer service division of Polymerland has reduced costs by 35%</p>         and the company receives 200,000 fewer telephone calls from its</p>         customers.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          For information regarding Polymerland visit </p>		  <a href="http://www.gepolymerlandeurope.com" target="_blank" </p>		  title="Opens in a new window">http://www.gepolymerlandeurope.com</a></p>      </p></p>      <h3></p>         Cisco Systems Case Study</p>      </h3></p>      <p></p>          Cisco Systems, Inc. is the worldwide leader in networking for the</p>         Internet.

This employee tool enabled cost reduction but also improved</p>         efficiency. All employees can submit their personal business expenses</p>         via the intranet Cisco's METRO expense reporting application has</p>         reduced the cost of processing expense reports (compared to the</p>         traditional paper system) from US$50.69 in 1996 to $1.90 in 1999.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          Beautiful in its simplicity and powerful in its benefits. METRO</p>         translates into a 96% reduction in costs or US$77 million annually.</p>         Also gained was the average processing time of expenses was reduced</p>         from 21 days to only 4 days.</p>      </p></p>      <p></p>          For information regarding Cisco visit <a href="http://www.cisco.com"</p>         target="_blank" name="Opens in a new window">http://www.cisco.com</a></p>      </p></p>      <h3></p>         Productivity Increases</p>      </h3></p>      <p></p>          Information is an important tool in everyday business. The</p>         company-wide access to information can determine the success of sales,</p>         time-to-market, customer service and many other mission critical</p>         operations. Intranets and Extranets can, when built with the users</p>         needs in mind, improve this information delivery process. Productivity</p>         can also be improved with faster and more efficient processing of</p>         transactions and orders.</p>      </p></p>      <h3></p>         Eli Lilly Case Study</p>      </h3></p>      <p></p>         Eli Lilly and Company is a leader in the pharmaceutical industry.
