<p> Philip Greenspun is teaching a course in Web Application design on Oct 2nd and 3rd at NYU in Greenwich. The course is <b>free</b>!  I went to his class at MIT and found it to be very good. He's also looking for developers for ArsDigita, his Web design firm.  </p> <p> Details are included in the following e-mail. </p> <p> (Posted with Phil's Permission)</p><p> Thanks.<br> <P> bob </p> <P>  From: philg@mit.edu<br> To: bob@segnet.com<br> Subject: please talk to your Web-nerd friends in New York City!<br> Date: Sat, 11 Sep 1999 01:16:31 GMT<br> <P>  <P> Remember my one-day course on Web application design? (<a href="http://photo.net/teaching/one-day-web.html" target="_new">http://photo.net/teaching/one-day-web.html</a>) I'm doing it again.  Please send email to your friends in New York City suggesting that they come on October 2 or 3.  The course is free and will be held at NYU in Greenwich Village.  They can register at <A HREF="http://register.photo.net/" target="_new">http://register.photo.net</A> </P> <P> For your friends in the Boston area, I'm also doing the course again on October 23 at MIT.  Again, reserve a spot at <A HREF="http://register.photo.net/" target="_new">http://register.photo.net</A>  </P> <P> For yourself, consider coming to our ArsDigita Community System tutorial and users group meeting, October 24 at MIT: <A HREF="http://photo.net/teaching/one-day-acs.html" target="_new">http://photo.net/teaching/one-day-acs.html</A> </P> <P> You'll meet lots of other folks who are building Web services starting with our free open-source toolkit.   Some of them are doing great things for the world, others are banking their $millions in venture capital. You will have a chance to influence the direction of the toolkit (hinted at in <A HREF="http://photo.net/acsplans/" target="_new">http://photo.net/acsplans/</A> ) and find out about interesting new features, e.g., we added file attachment/photo upload capability to all of the comment systems. </P> <P> If you're an experienced software engineer, you might want to attend our three-week boot camp: <A HREF="http://photo.net/teaching/boot-camp.html" target="_new">http://photo.net/teaching/boot-camp.html</A> Currently scheduled dates: October 4-24 and November 29-December 17. </P> <P> Not convenient?  Get your local university to adopt our one-semester course from MIT.  Five schools (including Caltech and MIT) are teaching it.  All of the materials are available for free from <A HREF="http://photo.net/teaching/one-term-web.html" target="_new">http://photo.net/teaching/one-term-web.html</A> </P> <P> Speaking of good software engineers, if you know any who'd like to make a significant contribution to software for Web-based collaboration and education, have them look at <A HREF="http://arsdigita.com/jobs.html" target="_new">http://arsdigita.com/jobs.html</A> (sorry to sound desperate but we're at $10 million in revenue, doubling every six months, and our current staff of 40 developers won't stretch to accomodate all of the work). </P> <P> Philip </P>
