<P>Microsoft was force yesterday to take down its <A href="http://www.hotmail.com/" target="_blank" title="Hotmail.com">Hotmail</A> service for four hours due to a security hole</p>                     enabling a malicious spammer to intercept Hotmail authentication cookies and take over users' accounts. </P></p><P>The hole uses HTML containing Javascript, which when a victim views an attached file the script intercepts the cookies and forwards them to a hostile site. </P></p><P>Hotmail has fixed the hole by redirecting victims who activate the attachment before the JavaScript has a chance to intercept the cookies. </P></p><P>Details on the hole can be found at <A href="http://www.peacefire.org/security/hmattach" target=_blank title="Visit Peacefire">Peacefire</A>.</P>
