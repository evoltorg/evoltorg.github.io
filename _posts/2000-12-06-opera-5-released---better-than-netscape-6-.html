<a href="http://www.opera.com/" target="_blank">Opera Software</a> has released a new version of its popular browser, with new features, and it looks very promising, maybe even more than Netscape could deliver.</p><p>To do away with their old disadvantage of charging for their software, while Internet Explorer and Netscape offer their browsers for free, the Norwegian company now offers an ad-sponsored version for free in addition to the regular, US$39.00 (standard price) version. The ad version downloads ads once a week only.</p><p>The previous versions were known for their speed, small size, accessibility, and support for standards.</p><p>The new version pushes for some more:</p><ul></p><li>Instant messaging included (ICQ compatible, you can use your old account with Opera).</li></p><li>Included search options, with option to save searches as bookmarks</li></p><li>OperaShow feature turns the browser into a presentation tool</li></p><li>WAP-surfing possible with experimental support for WML</li></p><li>Integrated Java, so that you only need to install one package</li></p><li>Multilanguage interface: By installing a new language file, Opera 5 will interact with you in a new language.</li></p><li>Built-in e-mail client with vital features:</li></p>  <ul></p>  <li>Import: From Eudora and Outlook Express.</li></p>  <li>Multiple accounts: For yourself and other users.</li></p>  <li>Folders: Organize your e-mail.</li></p>  <li>Filters: E.g. put private incoming e-mail in the "Private" folder.</li></p>  <li>Queueing: Prepare e-mails offline, then go online and send them.</li></p>  <li>Search engine: Find particular e-mails.</li></p>  <li>Protocols: POP and SMTP.</li></p>  </ul></p></ul></p><p>Opera also offers many options for sys admins, webdesigners, and programmers at their site.</p><p>See more at <a href="http://www.opera.com/opera5/specs.html" target="_blank">Specifications of Opera 5</a></p><p>I am off to browse around with it some more!</p><p>Till later, maybe I will add some more comments if others don't beat me to it.</p><p>Best Regards to all Evolters,<br>.wolf
