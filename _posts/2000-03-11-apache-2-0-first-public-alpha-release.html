<p>The <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_new">Apache Project</a> has released the first public alpha of Apache 2.                                                                                                \n<p>Apache 2.0a1 "includes several new enhancements, including the new Apache Portable Run-time and the new Multi-processing modules," according to Apache.</p></p><p><p>You can read a list of <a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_2_0.html" target="_new">New Features</a>, or <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/" target="_new">download the alpha</a> to try it out.</p></p><p><p>The alpha is available as source code only, not as binaries - so you will need a compiler to play with it.  This is hardly surprising, considering the alpha is described as a "developer-only alpha release with numerous bugs and new features. Guaranteed to give you the best roller coaster ride of the year."</p>
