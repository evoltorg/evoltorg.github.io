Among all the ways to make money on the internet, selling Ebooks is the latest and best growing e-business industry around. One way to make a lot of money from your home-based business is to buy and rearrange master Ebook resale right products so that it is customized to your preference and looks resourcefully at the same token.</p><p>Step 1: Purchase a few high-quality and current Ebooks (3-4) with master resale rights. If you don’t have any already, browse the web for them. You may run across even some good-quality, free ones like Ebooksdeal.com.</p><p>\nStep 2: Get involved with your product and develop your PK (product knowledge). Make sure to use them and fully understand the concepts for each.</p><p>Step 3: Create a detailed guide for each Ebook product/software. This is a very essential step because you are essentially rebranding your online sales items. You hold the master Ebook resale right so you can modify and add things such as a detailed user guide. Make the guide easy, using lots of headers and bullets and ensure that your instructions are useful. Explain what you learned and what they should avoid.</p><p>Step 4: Convert your guide into PDF format. This looks more professional and is supported by various platforms. I use Primo PDF because it’s free and easy to use.</p><p>Step 5: Create fresh and exciting sales letter to entice buyers. I recommend that you either create nice graphics if you have Photoshop software, or outsource and pay a few bucks to have a more professional look ($50 - $300). Don’t worry -- it’s well worth the money after you rebrand this to your style.</p><p>Step 6: Finalize the package. Compile your guides and products into a neat and simple package. You can have 1 site where they all flock to or you can be more creative and send them to download pages that direct them to other download pages. You can add links to your other products so that you get more contact and even add affiliate links to get that little bit extra income. Every bit counts.\n<a href="http://www.ebook-marketing-exposed.com">www.ebook-marketing-exposed.com</a>\n<a href="http://www.ebookmarketing.infozabout.com">www.ebookmarketing.infozabout.com</a></p><p>Step 7: Create backend offer and start selling. A great way to promote is to create a backend offer at the “Thank You Page” such as a collection of Ebooks with the Ebooks resale right for each one or a special report written by you. Start promoting your new master Ebook resale product (write articles, forums, email list, affiliate, etc).</p><p>\n
