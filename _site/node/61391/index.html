          <h2>The List Tip Tradition</h2>
<p class="meta">02 Nov 2008</p>

<div class="post">
<h2>What is a tip?</h2>\n<p>\n<q>Tipping</q> is an evolt.org <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/mailman/listinfo/thelist">discussion list</a> tradition.  As item 2 in our <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/index.php?content=listinfo">list guidelines</a> describes, tipping is the way a list member voluntarily "pays" for an off-topic, chatty, or high noise-to-signal post.  \n</p><p>\nThe practice of tipping goes back to Webmonkey's "Monkeyjunkies" discussion list (1997-2000), and the "objunky," or obligatory junky&mdash;which was simply an obtuse name for a web development tip.  Monkeyjunkies list moderator Taylor described the objunky this way:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\nIf you post a chatty, off-topic, or noisy post in which you aren't directly asking or responding to a Web question, you need to "pay" the list for the lowered signal-to-noise ratio. So you must include an ob(ligatory)junky (spelling intentional) tip. Give us a bit of knowledge on Web publishing in any area you want that is pertinent, insightful, or just plain helpful. If you can't think of a tip, then you probably shouldn't be chatting.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nIn October of 1998 Webmonkey published a collection of objunkies, many from future evolters, in article called <q>Advice from Primates.</q> In December of 1998, a <a href="http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/msg009763.html" title="userland archives: t monkeyjunkies and evolt.org">fracas</a> ensued between some on the Monkeyjunkies list and Wired digital, eventually leading to a group of about 30 list members leaving Monkeyjunkies to form evolt.org.  With the <code><tip></code>, evolt.org kept the <code><objunky></code> tradition alive. \n</p>\n<h2>When do we tip?</h2>\n<p>\nThe tip is not a punishment, rather it is a way to add signal to noise, and share something cool with the community.  Sometimes you might just feel like offering a tip&mdash;though offtopic or chatty posts need to have a tip, it is not necessary to include an offtopic or chatty post with your tip, especially since we now have an alternate list especially for off-topic posts: <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/mailman/listinfo/thechat">thechat</a>. \n</p><p>\nYou may feel like you don't have enough specialized knowledge to leave a good tip.  This is where the generalized nature of thelist works for us.  Tips, of course, should be web- or internet-related.  But what may seem like relatively basic knowledge in your specialty area may not be self-evident to everyone on the list.  And it can be a fun challenge to think of a good tip.  Try it!  Eventually you may find yourself collecting ideas for tips as you run across neat tricks and techniques in daily life.\n</p>\n<h2>What is the tip harvester?</h2>\n<p>\nEarly in our history, evolt.org programmers came up with the idea of collecting list tips and storing them in a database where they can be browsed and searched by evolt.org members.  Thus the <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/harvest/">tip harvester</a> was born.\n<p>\nOnce a week, our tip harvester parses messages sent to thelist, looking for tips contained within <tip></tip> tags.  Adding "type" and "author" attributes to your tip tag helps the tip harvester organize and sort tips.   Tip harvester attributes are case-sensitive, so <code><tip author="Erika"></code> is read as different than <code><tip author="erika"></code>\n</p>\n<h2>Try it!</h2>\n<p>\nTipping is a useful challenge and a tradition that strengthens the evolt.org community.  Try it!\n</p></p><p>\n
