<p>The Community News category will alleviate communication gaps between site visitors, members and participants on the various evolt.org mailing lists. It will provide one place for you to keep up on the latest additions and features to the evolt.org web site and serve as an information source announcing new lists, sub-sites, and projects. It will serve as an on-site duplicate for important announcements sent to our lists, such as server down time.</p></p><p><p>A regular community newsletter detailing the adventures and accomplishments of evolt.org members will also be featured here; more details on this new project to come in the near future.</p></p><p><p>So, if you're hosting a Beervolt in your area, hoping to coordinate the next CodeFest, or read up on the next planned Evoltageddon, this is the place to look.</p>
