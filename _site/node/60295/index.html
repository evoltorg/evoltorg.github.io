<p>Hi there, you want me, I know you do. You got something to sell or you want to \nbe heard, or you want to share. In any case - you need me. To make matters worse,\nyou don't know anything about me.</p>\n<p>I could be old, young, boy, girl, man, woman, \nhandicapped or fully abled. I can choose from a great variety of means to use\nthe internet and technology to control it, and you don't stand much chance to \nknow what I use.</p></p><p><h2>The things you do to get me</h2></p><p><p>You try hard to get me, no doubt about that. After all, your income or - in sadder\ncases - your happiness, depends on it. And to ensure I hear you, you go far. Sometimes\nyou get pushy, and that puts me off. Let me count the ways you can annoy me:</p></p><p><h3>Don't throw things at me!</h3></p><p><p>One thing you seem to think makes a lot of sense is throwing things at me.</p> \n<p>Open new windows, cover my viewport in banners, make everything on the page\njump at me when I touch it with my mouse or tab to it with my keyboard. </p>\n<p>You know what? This is annoying. I didn't ask for it, why do you think I want \nit when you push harder? I counteract. To avoid wasting my time closing windows, \nI use popup blockers. To get rid of things that are unrelated to what I was \nlooking for I use web filtering or browser extensions that turn off animation \nand images of a certain size. Isn't the mere existence of these products hint \nenough that I may not want to have things shoved in my face? If you need to use\na new window for something, make me aware of it. Tell me which links open in a \nnew window, and I know what will happen. </p></p><p><h3>Don't think I am mainly interested in the technology of your site</h3></p><p><p>We are all different. Things that make you go "ouhhhh" might make me go "ewwww" \nor "zzzzzz".</p>\n<p>It is not as common any longer, but there was a time where a web site without a\nlong and amazing flash tunnel was no web site. Thank god that this is over.</p> \n<p>Still, there are things you use that are amusing or interesting for the first time, \nbut really bug me when I come back (if you are lucky and I do come back). Don't make me \nwait for you, don't fade the page or the navigation in and out endlessly. I might\nnot have your fancy and fast computer, which means I wait a lot longer than you,\nand I don't like waiting, not at all. Time is money. Yes, there are flat rates and\nI don't pay by the minute any longer, but I still consider my time precious. \nI am not likely to be impressed by the same thing over and over again. You can \nimpress me for the first time, but please, give me a chance to get rid of that \nsame thing when I come back. Put it somewhere, in a sitemap for \nexample, so, if I'd be inclined to see it again, I can have another look at it.\nAlso, I might not see your fancy thing at all! I might be security aware or \nparanoid, or my company is, and have all plug-ins and scripting and whatnot turned\noff. If you still want me, give me another way to reach you.</p></p><p><h3>Don't patronize me</h3></p><p><p>I appreciate that you want the best for me. That is nice. But please don't \nthink that what is best for you, is also best for me. I know what is best for me,\nI installed my computer or bought my mobile or my TV set top box, and, if possible,\nchose my browser and the plug-ins I want to have. The plug-ins I might have gotten, \nbecause I wanted to reach some content, that was nicely offered to me. Don't\nthink that making your web site look and behave like your operating system gives\nme the same homely feeling it gives you. I willingly came to see your site, I \ndon't want to change my browser or operating system. Don't block me out, because\nI am not like you. You like your design; you think it is the best. I might disagree\nand use my own user style sheet to overwrite all that is out there. Can you still \noffer me your product or your content? If so, good for us, if not, bad for you.</p></p><p><h3>Don't redecorate my house</h3></p><p><p>I like my browser / surfing device. I chose it, or I got it chosen for me, or \nI don't have a chance to change it. Don't take it away from me, or I'll be \nmiffed. I like to use the back button, when I think the page I surfed to is \nnot what I wanted. I don't need your page in full screen, if I want that, I can\ndo that myself. Don't take away my toolbars or my ability to right-click or \nshift click an element. You can't win. </p>\n<ul>\n</li>You open your site in an x by y window - I copy and paste the url from the \nproperties into my own window</li>\n<li>You turn off my back button - I use a keyboard shortcut to go back to the previous document.</li>\n<li>You change my browser history to always go back to your page - I disable Javascript</li>\n<li>You use a "no right click" script - I disable Javascript</li> \n</ul>\n<p>There is no need for us to fight an uneven battle like this. If you give an \nimportant document to someone, you don't re-arrange their desk \nfirst, do you? Why do you think I want you to change my browser? I like it \nthe way it is, with all my shortcuts, toolbars, sidebars and tabs.</p></p><p><h3>Don't replicate what I already have - and badly at that</h3></p><p><p>I use a browser, and that fabulous thing comes with everything I need: The \nability to move around a document via tabbing, scrolling with my mouse wheel or \nmy trackball or via the scrollbars, the ability to enter text and send it off to\nyour server.</p> \n<p>I like these controls - a lot! I got used to them, which might have\nbeen a long and painful process, so please don't confuse me by changing them to\nfit your design.</p> \n<p>I don't need a DHTML scroller that I cannot use with a keyboard, \nor that shows no indicator how big the document is. I don't want to search for\nform fields and buttons and scrollbars - chances are that you are not able to \nstyle them properly for my browser anyway.</p> \n<p>These are vital elements of my surfing\nexperience, I don't want to think about them, they trigger automated processes in my brain. If you make \nme look for them, you take my attention away from your content, and that is what\nyou don't want, right?</p> \n<p>If I want to print out your page, I do so by pressing the cute printer icon of \nmy browser, or I use my keyboard shortcut, I don't need a link, image or button\nsending me to that one, a gadget that only works with javascript anyway. If you \nadd a "print this" feature, then please give me a proper print version of the \ndocument, with stripped backgrounds, no unnecessary navigation and the inline links \nas a list of URLs underneath so I can look them up next time I go online.</p> \n<p>If I want to bookmark your site, I can do that, no need for you to give me an \nextra javascript link for that, thanks.</p>\n<p>Popups I close almost immediately -  no need to add a javascript close button.</p> \n<p>And if there is a need for a back button, then your concept of navigation failed,\nand I am not likely to use it anyways, as my browser comes with a cool back button \nand keyboard shortcut to go back to the previous document.</p></p><p><h2>So, how can you get me?</h2></p><p><p>There are some things, that have been and are done successfully throughout the \nyears of the internet. The biggest one is the big C - content.</p></p><p><h3>Provide me with the content I want</h3></p><p><p>A web site with the right content can look horrid and be a tad harder\nto use -  I don't care, as I found what I was looking for. The easier to get to\nthe content, the better.</p> \n<p>Write plain text and cut it  into easily digestible \nchunks rather than 2 pages of corporate mumbo jumbo before I find the one \nthing I want.</p> \n<p>If it is a download I want, make the download links with version \nnumbers and sizes available from the very beginning, I promise to read on while\nI download!</p></p><p><h3>Provide me with a clean and fast navigation - give me a sitemap to access everything</h3>\n  \n<p>Your navigation is what takes me by the hand and leads me through your web site.</p>\n<p>Don't make me search for it, don't smother me in links I really don't need at \nthe moment, just make it easy for me to see where I am in your site, and what \nelse is in this section. Keep the navigation on the same spot and looking \nroughly the same and I feel secure and guided without being pushed. \nUse the right wording in your navigation, keep it short and simple, I don't need\npoetry and metaphors in navigation items.</p>\n<p>There is normally no need to allow me to go to every page in the site within \nthe main navigation - this'll only mean I need to navigate through a lot of links \nto find what I want - keep this to the sitemap.</p> </p><p><h3>Let me search</h3>\n<p>I love searching, and a good search feature is perfect if I don't have the time\nto navigate through your site - this time. Give me a search function that is \neasy to use and prominently available on each page and I promise to use it and\nstay a bit.</p></p><p><h3>Make me feel comfortable </h3></p><p><p>Use nice, clean language to help me overcome my original shyness and reluctance to stay long. Use good harmonious \ncolour schemes and imagery to give me a good feeling about your site -  don't forget\nto add alternative content for those, should I not be able to see.</p>\n<p>Make sure to \nkeep a nice and consistent look throughout the site.</p>\n<p>When there are processes that \nneed more than one step, provide me with an indicator how far I am in the process\nand allow me to go back any time. </p></p><p><h3>Invite me to participate</h3>\n<p>Give me options to tweak your content to my desires, allow me to get rid of \nparts and add others that I am interested in. Tell me what I have looked at before\nand alert me when there was an update in that section. Offer me related articles\nor products and greet me when I come back to your page next time. Nothing is better\nfor you and me than me coming back and be reminded of a good experience. </p></p><p><h3>Stay fresh</h3>\n<p>The home page should not be a static "hello to yaddayaddayadda" page, it has to\nbe a living and changing element of the site that tells me about changes and \nhighlights special features and new content. Only that way I can find the \ngoodies immediately.</p> </p><p><h2>Don't cry, I didn't take your toys away</h2>\n<p>I am aware that your web presence is your baby, and you are proud of it, and \nyou want to make it interesting for you and for me. That is how you ended up \nusing cool technological tricks and web design ideas that are the talk of town at \nthe moment in the first place.</p> \n<p>I don't want you to create boring text sites, you \ncan add cool stuff, just make sure to do so in moderation.</p>\n<p>Make sure that \nonly those who can access the cool enhancements get them, and that they  fall back to \na usable HTML construct for everybody. I like nice designs as much as you do, \nbut I still want headlines in my document. I love navigations that have smooth\nrollovers and effects, but I might need those as lists of links at the same time. \nDegrade gracefully, as they call it, it is harder to do, but fun to find out how \nto do it.</p> </p><p><p>Trust me, for I am user, and you want me.</p>
