<P>After Microsoft ignored a cease \nand desist letter sent on April 25, 2000, the Digital Divas \n(<a href="http://www.digitaldivas.com">www.digitaldivas.com</a>) have launched a massive internet \ncampaign known as "Diva and Goliath" to stop Microsoft's \ncontinued infringement on their trademark.  The Digital Divas \ndiscovered in April that Microsoft launched a promotion known \nas the Microsoft Digital Diva (<a href="http://www.digitaldiva.com">www.digitaldiva.com</a>), employing \na woman who appears to offer help to consumers with computer \nand the internet use.  According to Digital Divas founder Dana \nWhitmire (<a href="http://www.danas.net">www.danas.net</a>), "these are exactly the types of \nservices our group has offered to the internet community for \nalmost three years.  We feel Microsoft has tried to capitalize \non the good will we have worked hard to build." \n</P>\n<P>\nThe Digital Divas were founded by Whitmire in 1997.  They \nprovide computer and internet assistance from their website and \npromote the services of their members, all of whom are \nexperienced and successful computer professionals.  The group \nis composed of 71 members from 17 U.S. states and 7 foreign \ncountries.  The purpose of the Diva and Goliath campaign is \nthreefold.  According to spokesperson Faith A. Kaminsky, "our \nsmall group has limited resources.  We are hoping that the \ncampaign will get the internet community behind us, help us \nraise some money to commence a lawsuit, and hopefully attract a \nlawyer to assist us."  The Digital Divas are the founders of \nGrey Day (www.greyday.org), an annual copyright awareness event \nthat began on October 1, 1998.  Many of the members, including \nTimmi Sommer feel that Microsoft's actions "are particularly a \nslap in the face" for that reason.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe cease and desist letter sent to Microsoft was written by \nthe New York law firm Moses & Singer (www.mosessinger.com) on a \npro bono basis.  According to Kaminsky, "we are extremely \ngrateful for the assistance of David Rabinowitz and Mark \nMarderosian, but we understand that it is a big task for any \nlawfirm to accept on a pro bono basis."\n</P>\n<P>\nComplete information about the Diva and Goliath campaign can be \nfound at <a href="http://www.digitaldivas.com/gol">www.digitaldivas.com/gol/</a>\n</P>
