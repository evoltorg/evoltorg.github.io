One of the most powerful weapons in the internet marketersâ€™ arsenal is the Ebook. Indeed the free Ebook is perhaps the most powerful weapon of all and particularly so if used to promote virally through internet word of mouth. Writing your own viral Ebooks is quick and easy to do and can profit you in multiple ways. Here are some big reasons why you should get in on the action. \nEbooks are cheap to produce. All you need is your imagination and a subject in which you have an interest. Fire up your word processor of choice and start typing. Save the finished work as a pdf file and you have an Ebook. It really is that simple to create an Ebook. Include links back to your web site and give the Ebook away making sure people in turn have the right to give it to their friends and so on. \nEbook is of good quality it will get passed on to a potentially unlimited amount of people. Each one of which is a potential visitor to your web site, subscriber to your mailing list or purchaser of your product or one you are promoting. Just keep repeating the process and see where it takes you. \nOr if writing is not your strong point you can use rebrand able Ebooks that have been produced by others. Basically use your favourite search engine to find them. Make sure you comply with the rights of the Ebooks you find. Some may grant you the right to resell the Ebook; some may allow you the right to give it away. Always comply with the terms of the license. \nEbooks are ideal for viral promotion as they are capable of reaching an extremely large readership. So it is completely vital that your Ebooks contain something that people will want to share. Think about the Ebook you want to write. Who is it for and what would they find useful to know. Do a little research and write accordingly. Zero in on a niche market for a tighter, more targeted response. For example if you write an Ebook on dog training you will be trying to cover a huge topic. Write your Ebook on how to train a particular breed of dog and you can focus more. \nEbooks are a way to sell related products. For example if write your Ebook about training Alsatian dogs you can include information on related things such as dog food, dog treats and so on. Your readers can check out the products you recommend and quite possibly earn you an affiliate commission if they make a purchase through your Ebook.\nYour Ebooks will build your reputation as a quality author who gives great information. Your readers will then want to pass on the Ebook to others if you allow that in the terms of your Ebook. Make it easier for your readers to redistribute by giving them an incentive to do so. A great way to enable that is to allow your readers the ability to replace some of your affiliate links with some of theirs to make a truly viral Ebook. Both your reader and you now have the opportunity to earn affiliate commissions from that one viral Ebook. Repeat multiple times for greater earnings potential.\nWithin a short space of time you can have many Ebooks spreading virally all over the internet. Each one a little seed planted countless times and each seed can grow in to your own little money tree. That is the power of viral Ebook marketing.\n
