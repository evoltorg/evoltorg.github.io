In this article, I will introduce some useful and free PDF software , which can both edit, convert , Merge PDF files. So that you can get the best benefit from the PDF work !<br></p><p>This post is originally posted in www.aeBeta.com<br></p><p>As you can see , I have writen quite a lot on PDF, because it is so common for both daily study and work. You can simply find them from this link. However, most of them are commercial softwares, and what I just mentioned is just some time limited promotion so that you can get them for free. But in this list I will collect some useful and powerful freewares to make you PDF work much easier.<br></p><p>In this list , all of them wiill have the following functions on PDF:<br></p><p>* Merge, split or reorder pages of a PDF document;<br>\n* Rotate or crop pages<br>\n* Add a header and footer<br>\n* Add page numbers<br>\n* Add a watermark<br>\n* Encrypt or decrypt<br>\n* Highlight text or annotate<br>\n* Tweak viewer preference or change metadata<br>\n* Convert PDF to images, or vice versa<br>\n* Convert PDF to text, or vice versa<br>\n* Convert PostScript to PDF<br>\n* Do other functions<br>\nPDFill PDF Tools<br></p><p>PDFill PDF Tools is by far my favorite because of its clean and nice user interface with most of the functions covered, such as merge pdf files, split or reorder pages, rotate or crop pdf pages, add headers and footers complete with page numbers, etc.<br></p><p>Watermark can be added by typing in any text such as ‘DRAFT’ for documents to be reviewed, or can be added by a background image in PDF format.<br></p><p>Some additional features are supported such as encrypt and decrypt with security options; reformat multiple pages into one page; delete, flatten or list of PDF form fields; convert PDF to images or vice versa; and convert a PostScript file to PDF.<br></p><p>The installer bundles with PDFill PDF Editor which is not free, but PDFill PDF Tools can run on its own after installation. The free software does not support other functions such as converting PDF to text, making annotations, etc. Instead, they are available to Specific Tools listed in the next section.<br></p><p>Official Site:http://www.pdfill.com/pdf_tools_free.html<br>\nPDFTK Builder<br></p><p>PDFTK Builder may be used as an alternative. It can merge or reorder selected pages of PDF files at one go. This is a better idea to have merging and reordering of pages done at the same time.<br></p><p>It also supports split, rotate, background/stamp and encrypt features. Besides these, it has no other additional features.<br></p><p>It also lacks a basic function, as available to PDFill PDF Tools, for adding a background text as a watermark to PDF documents. This function is much needed when we need to mark a PDF document as ‘Confidential’, ‘Draft’ or in any other text in the background of the pages.</p><p>Official url:http://www.angusj.com/pdftkb/<br>\njPDF Tweak<br></p><p>This is an Open Source Solution ! If you just need more features, jPDF Tweak will be a good choice but its user interface will not be better than any of the above two applications. Its merge, split and reorder functions are available under ‘input’ tab with a new filename to be entered under ‘output’ tab.<br></p><p>jPDF Tweak offers rotate, watermark and format multiple pages, change page numbers and chapter bookmarks, and encrypt functions.<br></p><p>It allows adding attachments to PDF documents, setting viewer preference and document properties including title, author, subject and keywords.<br></p><p>Official url:http://jpdftweak.sourceforge.net/<br>\nPDF Shuffler: Recommended under Linux !<br></p><p>Re-arranging pages in a pdf document, or merging and splitting pdf files, would be much easier with PDF Shuffler.<br></p><p>After importing one or more pdf files to PDF Shuffer, you are presented with the pages of files in thumbnails so that you can easily merge, re-order or delete the pages, or right-click a thumbnail to rotate or crop a page before exporting to a new pdf file.\n<br>\nThis program is a small application running on Linux. Some distros, such as Ubuntu 9.10, include this program in the repository for ease of download and setup.\n<br>\nOfficial url:http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfshuffler/\n<br>\nLast but not least, we should shoul the highest respect to these open source and freeware solutions provider!\n<br>\nTo see the orginal post , go here:<br>\n<a href="http://www.aebeta.com/free-software/some-free-pdf-toolkit-list.html">http://www.aebeta.com/free-software/some-free-pdf-toolkit-list.html</a><br>,and more additional information on this topic will be published in <a href="http://www.aebeta.com">aebeta</a> as well .
