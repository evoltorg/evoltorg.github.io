What is Encryption?\nEveryone knows about Encryption: It’s a process by which data is converted into private code to ensure secure transmission. By encryption Data is Covert into secret code so it is unreadable except by authorized users. To convert data from its original form to a form that can only be read by someone that can reverse the encryption. \nThe purpose of encryption is to prevent unauthorized reading of the data. </p><p>About Encryption Software: TrueCrypt\nThere are many types of data encryption, and they are the basis of network security. You can encrypt the data by any Encryption Software. \nMain task of Encryption software is Encryption and Decryption of data, usually in the form of files on (or sectors of) hard drives and removable media, email messages, or in the form of packets sent over computer networks. \nTrueCrypt is a very Latest Software for Data Encryption. It’s free open-source disk encryption software for Windows Vista/XP, Mac OS X, and Linux.  TrueCrypt is a software system for establishing and maintaining an on-the-fly-encrypted volume.</p><p>Features & Functionality:</p><p>	This Software creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and builds up it as a real disk. \n	Encrypts an entire partition or storage device for example USB flash drive or hard drive.\n	TrueCrypt can on-the-fly encrypt a system partition or entire system drive\n	System encryption involves pre-boot authentication, which means to access the system, need to enter the correct password each time before Windows boots.\n	Data is automatically encrypted or decrypted right before it is loaded or saved, without any user intercession.\n	If in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password, It provides two levels of plausible deniability.\n1)	Hidden Volume - There are many situations where you cannot refuse to reveal the password (for example, due to extortion). Hidden volume allows you to solve such situations without revealing the password to your volume. You may Read data stored on the (outer) volume without any risk.\n2)	No TrueCrypt volume can be identified (volumes cannot be distinguished from random data).</p><p>TrueCrypt never saves any decrypted data to a disk – it only stores them temporarily in RAM.  When you restart Windows or turn off your computer, the volume will be dismounted and files stored in it will be unreachable and encrypted. Same thing Happens even when Power supply is suddenly interrupted. To make them accessible again, you have to mount the volume - provide the correct password and/or keyfile. </p><p>Regards, \nJohn Thomas\nwww.perceptionsystem.com
