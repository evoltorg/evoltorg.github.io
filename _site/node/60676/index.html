Today's options for information distribution, storage and retrieval-on both the networked and personal level-are more varied than ever before. </p><p>Technological advances allow today's hard drives to offer tremendous capacity, while flash memory offers incredible convenience and portability. Indeed, the emerging acceptance of a standard platform for network and personal computing, along with the introduction of the CD, has had a permanent effect on print's dominance of data storage and transmission. </p><p>Optical disks (CDs and DVDs) can store the equivalent of thousands of volumes in document pages, text, graphics, images and video. Although data stored on such media can be printed out, in order to make large quantities of information readily available, the most cost-effective means is to provide access via electronic data networks (LANs) for communication within an organization, or over the Internet.
