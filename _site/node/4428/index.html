          <h2>Breadcrumbs For All</h2>
<p class="meta">27 Dec 2000</p>

<div class="post">
<p>\n    Several sites now have a breadcrumb trail as a navigation aid. The\n    appeal is obvious: help the user work out where they are in\n    a hierarchical site. It's pretty good usability, which is probably\n    why <a href="http://www.useit.com/" target="_foo">Jakob Nielsen has one on his site</a>. \n    Here's how to add one to your own (Unix/Apache/Perl-hosted) site.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This code works for simple hierarchical sites - ones where there\n    is a simple tree structure. Below the home page, there are a set\n    of folders, each of which can have layers of subfolders. Each folder\n    can contain pages. In other words, your basic site.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The reason for this is that this is not a re-creation of the user's\n    browser history; it's a visualisation of a top-to-bottom path through\n    your information architecture.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The way it works is extremely simple:\n</p></p><p><ol>\n    <li>\n        Take a simple URL like<br>\n        <code>http://foo.co.uk/articles/content/systems.html</code>;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Swap <code>http://foo.co.uk</code> for <cite>Home</cite>\n        as it's the home page of the site;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Swap <code>systems.html</code> for a sensible title (a truely gifted\n        piece of code would pick this up from the page title with no performance\n        loss. This is no such piece of code, sorry, it picks it up from a query string);\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Split the rest of the URL at the slashes;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Add a link to all but the current page title;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Stick the bits together in order, using a sensible separator such \n        as <strong>-&gt;</strong>;\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Output it all as a single string to the page.\n    </li>\n</ol>    \n<p>\n    This script does exactly that, with one other bit of cleverness -\n    it capitalises the first letter of each bit, so that it appears\n    more sensible to the non-technical than the lower case version which\n    you'll probably be using in your URL schema.\n</p>\n<p>\n    There's also an additional extra which will only work if you're running\n    on Perl5.004 or later. It will correctly capitalise non-English chars\n    such as &#225;, &#222;, &#246; and &#241; (the one unsupported exception appears to\n    be &#223;). If this matters to you, and you are running Perl5.004 or later,\n    then comment out the line:<br>\n    <code>use locale;</code>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Also note:\n</p>\n<p>\nYou call the script by means of an SSI call:<br><br>\n<code><pre>&lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;/cgi-bin/cookie_trail.cgi?title=You%20put%20your%20title%20here&quot; --&gt;</pre></code><br><br>\nand the (URL-encoded) query string sets the title;\n</p>\n<p>\nThe title can also have links in it as long as you escape <em>all</em> the HTML entities - useful if you want to have a sub-article without creating a subdirectory:<br><br>\n<code><pre>?title=&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;library.html&amp;quot;%20class=&amp;quot;crumb&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Building%20a%20library&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;%20-&amp;gt;%20Current%20Reading%20List</pre></code>\n</p>\n<p>\nMy site has a special CSS class for the breadcrumb trail, so all the links output by the script will have <code>class=&quot;crumb&quot;</code>\nin them. If you want them out, then this is the line to edit:<br><br>\n<code><pre>$html .= qq -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;$crumbs_path[$i]/&quot; class=&quot;crumb&quot;&gt;$crumbs[$i]&lt;/a&gt;  ;</pre></code><br><br>\n(you delete the class attribute and value).\n</p>\n<h2>Get the Code</h2>\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.easyweb.co.uk/tutorials/cookie_trail.txt" target="_new" title="Opens in a new window">Here it is</a>
