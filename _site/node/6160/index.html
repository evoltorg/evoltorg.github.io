Come meet some of the evolt.org administrators and ply them with alcohol to get the inside scoop on what we've got planned for evolt.org.

Hang out, tell stories, attach faces to names, and make new friends.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you have any questions or comments, there's some healthy discussion on <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/mailman/listinfo/thechat" title="Find out what TheChat is and sign up!

How will you recognize the evolt crew? Good question! We'll be the ones with the distinct dark t-shirts that only a web developer could love.  Hope to see you there!\n</p>
