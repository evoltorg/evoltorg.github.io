<p>Someone in my company recently asked me for help\nwith a Javascript error she was getting.  "Sure," I said, \nbeing an old programmer who loves a challenge.  The problem\nwas on a very well-known Canadian corporation's Web site, \nwhich  several people inside our company use on a regular basis, and \nwho knows how many thousands in the real world.  It was happening in \nNetscape but not Internet Explorer.</p>\n<p>Here's the code that was generating the error --</p>\n<p style="font-family:monospace;font-size:12px">\n    &nbsp; &lt;input type="text" name="origin" size="10" value=""&gt;\n<br>&nbsp; &lt;img src="/images/nav/home/down_arrow.gif"\n<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;    width="16" height="22" align="absmiddle"\n<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;    alt="Choose a City" border="0"\n<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;    onMouseDown="setMouseDown(event, self);"\n<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;    onMouseUp="openWindow(event, self,\n<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;       'schedules/scheduling/cityOptions.html',\n<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;       'newWindow__schedule_origin__schedule_org',\n<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;       390, 140);"&gt;\n</p>\n<p>"Wow," I opined. "That is so cool!" &nbsp;\n"Shaddap, Rudy.  You're talking out loud again," \ncame a voice from over the cubicle partition.\n<p>This was the first time I had ever seen anything like this.  \nIt's a combination INPUT TEXT field and a\nspecial "down arrow" gif, and  together they look <em>just</em> like a dropdown select list.\nWhen you click on the image that looks like the down arrow of\na dropdown list, a small window pops up which contains --\nare you ready for this? -- a dropdown list!  You pick an entry from the list, \nand it gets populated back into the text box.  \n(How do I know this? Because it works fine in Internet Explorer. However,\nNetscape is our company standard.) You have to close the popup window \nusing the Close button, but that's a minor quibble.  Alternatively, if you know\nwhat you want, you can type it right into the text box.  Not a bad idea, \na combination input/dropdown control.  Too bad it throws an error\nin Netscape, eh?  \n<p>"Okay, I'll get to the bottom of this," I said -- to myself, this time.\nThere's a Contact page, I'll write to the webmaster.</p>\n<p>Here's what transpired.\nNote that I've changed the domain to foobar.ca  because\nthey did not give me permission to post their emails and make fun of them on \na public site, although I daresay they probably would never know it.\n</p></p><p><style>\n .rudy { font-family:monospace; color:#000066; font-size:12px }\n</style></p><p><div align=center>\n<table width="90%" bgcolor=#FFFFEE border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">\n<tr><td><p class="rudy">2000-10-03 15:47\n<br>&nbsp; hi webmaster\n<br>&nbsp; several people in our company are reporting javascript errors using your home page\n<br>&nbsp;    "JavaScript Error: http://www.foobar.ca/home.html, line 705: init is not defined."\n<br>&nbsp; plus a couple others (possibly related)\n<br>&nbsp; seems to be only certain versions of netscape (not sure)\n<br>&nbsp; internet explorer 4.01 works okay\n<br>&nbsp; rudy limeback</p></td></tr>\n</table></div> </p><p><p>It was <b>ten (10) days</b> before the answer came back:</p></p><p><div align=center>\n<table width="90%" bgcolor=#FFFFEE border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">\n<tr><td><p class="rudy">2000-10-13 10:13\n<br>&nbsp;Hello,\n<br>&nbsp; that will occur with older browsers.\n<br>&nbsp; Our website is compatible with versions of 4 +\n<br>&nbsp; regards,\n<br>&nbsp; webmaster@foobar.ca</p></td></tr>\n</table></div></p><p><p>Duh.
