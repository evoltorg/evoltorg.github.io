          <h2>When Searching For A Job In It</h2>

<p>It had been such a long time since I had updated \nmy resume on Monster, Hotjobs, and a few other \njob boards and as I was updating my 'hard copy' \nof my resume, I thought I'd update those as \nwell.  I finished updating them all around 2:30pm \non Wednesday afternoon.</p></p><p><p>Within a half hour several emails popped into \nmy mailbox.  I had two phone calls already for me \nwhen I got home and another one while I was \nhaving dinner.  The next morning 10 new emails \nwere in my email box.  Most were from headhunters \nthat 'heard that I was really good at what I \ndo'.  I got home on Thursday and found 11 voice \nmessages waiting for me.</p></p><p><p>So then, the craziness starts.  Not one of the \npeople who called me was actually hiring for their \nown company.  They were all recruiters looking to \nhelp someone like me land the next hot job.  When \nI told them that I wasn't seriously looking at \nthis time, many were trying to urge me towards \nleaving my job now.  One was even so rude as to \nask why and when I said 'personal reasons' they \npressed me for a more informative answer.</p></p><p><p>Then I had the task of replying to all of the \nemails I received.  I assumed that I could be \nreally bold with them and see what type of \nresponse I'd get.  Assuming that most were not \ninterested in talking to me so soon, I wrote them \nall the same polite email that explained:\n<ul>\n<li>That I wouldn't accept a job unless it was in \none of several geographic locations.\n<li>That I wasn't look for any positions with \nconsulting firms\n<li>My salary requirements\n<li>The time period during which I expected to be \nchanging jobs.\n</ul></p><p><p>Needless to say, that did the trick.  I didn't \nhear back from most of them.  But several did, \nand so I learned an important lesson.  Here's \npart of an email that I received:\n<blockquote><em>\nI suggest you take you resume off Monster so that \nno one starts sending it out already and \npotentially messing things up for you.  So people \njust send it out, but then won't be able to \ndeliver you for an interview, but you now are \nknown at that company, so that if in 3-4 months \nyou are presented again (this time when you are \nready) you do not get \nconsidered.</em></blockquote></p><p><p>I quickly blocked the visibility of my resumes \nas he told me.  Now the calls and emails have \nslowed down considerably.</p></p><p><p>I had such a poor response last year when I \nwas searching for a job out of school that I made \nthe wrong assumption that the same would occur \nagain.  How wrong I was?  While it's encouraging \nto know that there are that many jobs out there, \nthis has been quite overwhelming.  I've \ndefinitely learned from this and now I know the \nroutine for when I decide to look for a new job \nagain.</p></p><p><p>Happy to be your guinea pig,<br>\nJP Hackworth<br>\n<a href="mailto:hackworth@newstrolls.com">hackworth@newstrolls.com<br>\n<a href="http://www.newstrolls.com" target="_new">NewsTrolls, Inc.</a></p>
