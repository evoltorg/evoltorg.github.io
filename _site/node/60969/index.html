If you want to run a successful website or blog, you must work on both on-page and off-page. Some of the webmasters may disagree to this statement. Some would say, if you can develop a good product or if you can cater a good service, you do not need SEO or SEM. People will come to you and people would talk about you – and your users would become your marketing nodes. </p><p>Do you think whatever they are saying is true?</p><p>On the surface level, their statement may seem valid and to the point but lets take a look at it from another perspective. </p><p>Say for example, you are running a shop in your locality. Now if the business runs successfully, you would definitely see your competitors are popping up in good numbers. If there is a market need, the number of competitors would naturally grow.  </p><p>Now do you think, when the number of competitors are growing, you can have the same volume of business using the same business tactics? Do you really think only product quality would keep your business volume intact throughout the years! </p><p>If your answer is yes, there might be something wrong in your understanding – there had been something missing and you simply failed to understand the dynamic nature of consumers. </p><p>And if you think that, you must change the business tactics to stay ahead of your competitors and focus on the market need, you are moving in the right direction and you have high chances to win over your competitors (as a pioneer in that business and market segment, you would definitely have an edge over your competitors). </p><p>Now, the web is much bigger in size than your locality. Do you really think a good product is good enough to get you more business? If you track the history of web startups, you would see that a lot of business (both product and service based) have failed due to poor marketing strategy. </p><p>It is never enough to develop a good product or service; you must inform your target group about. It may sound harsh but the reality is that if you do not have a target market you do not have a product to sell. </p><p>Why do you think people think so much about creating a brand? They spend millions of Dollars to create, promote and sustain a brand in the market. And now think about the web where you might need to fight with the world to establish your business and just quality of the product is not the only criterion here. </p><p><a href="http://www.vertical-leap.co.uk/">Search engine optimisation</a> and marketing strategies have changed a lot over the years. It is not just about optimizing a website or getting good quality links to improve search engine ranking for niche keywords. If you take a look at the recent trends, you would see that, it is more about link positioning and creating a user friendly atmosphere. SEO and SEM is now a way to inform people about your product, marketing it online, promoting it in search engine result pages for niche key phrases and many more. </p><p>It is also about creating an online brand identity where the tools are different from offline market. And you need to constantly monitor latest web developments to provide your users a better experience and make netizens talk about you. \nIf you still have any doubt about the need of <a href="http://www.vertical-leap.co.uk/services/search-engine-optimisation.asp">SEO</a> and SEM, you may contact a local SEO company or some SEO expert to know in detail.
