<p>Quite busy these days.<br />\n    <br />\n  But I spend some time playing with first-in-Vietnam SEO Contestfor Vietnamese webmaster/emarketers/SEOers to compete with other for ranking no.1 in Google.com with the keyword <a href="http://vietseoguy.com/cuocthiseo/hello-cuocthiseohello-cuocthiseo/" mce_href="http://vietseoguy.com/cuocthiseo/hello-cuocthiseohello-cuocthiseo/">CuocThiSEO</a>.<br />\n  <br />\n  The time is going up. And the game will be over next 36 hours. Right now we can see the top 3 candidates.<br />\n  <br />\n  CuocThiSEO  dot com, the winner of February - hmm, this emarketer (I guess) is too  clever to grab this domain when the rules are not strict.<br />\n  <br />\n  CuocThiSEO  dot Hostindexvn dot com - this guy (a truly SEOer I beg) has some other  good sites to support. This site is linked from CuocThiSEO dot com  however. If everything goes on like what I guess, this site will come  first! He just changed his site to wordpress within 1 week.<br />\n  <br />\n  CuocThiSEO  hyphen SEO dot CO dot CC, the first month winner - this guy endlessly  earns links from social networking sites. He&rsquo;s wise enough to choose  dofollow sites. This Joomla-based site, just like the candidates above,  provides good tips a/b SEO (though by just rewriting or modifying some  words for better keyword density and cheating Google).<br />\n  <br />\n  Sphereteam&rsquo;s Ced and his French SEO mate have their sites on top 15 too. Ced is better with top 10.<br />\n  <br />\n  Besides,  I realize other truly Vietnamese SEO guys such as the owner of  Winnerofcuocthiseo dot Blogspot dot com, who possessing other good  sites like Vinabet or Vn-SEO (just my guest) and the guy of CuocThiSEO  dot US dot TC. These 2 guys specially like web directories. <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>Well, so what I LEARN from this SEO Contest?</strong><br />\n  <br />\n  First, Google updates their algorithms all the time.<br />\n  <br />\n  Second,  Sandbox still works and if you don&rsquo;t have more control on the web  server then your site goes lost somewhere elst. Thats the case of the  leading site in January hosted by Dreamhosters.<br />\n  <br />\n  Third, we can  cheat Google in a certain period of time, with spamming, copyscaping  but in long term, your sites will drop down in Google SERPs.<br />\n  <br />\n  Next, the key to win any SEO Contest is&hellip;patience and cleverness!<br />\n  <br />\n  Last,  SEO Contests like this are in Google consideration (I guess) and the  giant would have some policies or penalties later. Simply sites  targeting the nonsense keywords bring less value to users.<br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>And huh, what I EARN from this SEO Contest?</strong><br />\n  <br />\n  Well,  to be honest, besides the 5 lessions above, I really earn more than  2.52 US dollars from Adsense (up to now, this may increase next days)  with 10 clicks and 1416 impressions.<br />\n  <br />\n  Actually there&rsquo;re some other interesting things a/b this SEO Contest. But I like to keep it secret now&hellip;<br />\n  <br />\n  BTW, thanks guys for supporting me with some links for this <a href="http://vietseoguy.com/cuocthiseo" mce_href="http://vietseoguy.com/cuocthiseo">CuocThiSEO</a> SEO Contest&hellip; <br />\n  <br />\n  <strong>VietSEOGuy!</strong></p>
