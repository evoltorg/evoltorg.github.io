          <h2>Getting Fresh With Your Content</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Dan said we need a new article on our front page. So, I'm here to talk about the \nimportance of having fresh content.</p>\n<p>It's a well known fact that visitors to a website enjoy \nseeing new content on a somewhat regular basis. \nMany of the most popular sites on the Web are the \nones that have the most frequently updated content.  Sites like \n<a href="http://slashdot.org" target="_new">/.</a>, \n<a href="http://www.metafilter.com" target="_new">Metafilter</a>, and at times, \n<a href="http://evolt.org">yours truly</a>.  \nThese dog days of summer (in the northern hemisphere at least) are well known \nfor generating little news, happenings, events, or things to talk about in general.\n</p>\n<p>So what's a site to do? You want to keep users coming back, \ninterested, and happy - but it's a difficult task when there's not a \nwhole lot going on!  Fear not, gentle reader.  Me and my friends have some \nhints that might help you pull through these slow times:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>You can write parodies \n(<a href="http://www.microsith.com/index.php3" target="_new">1</a>, \n<a href="http://www.vestige.org/idiotbox.html" target="_new">2</a>). It's a nice way \nto escape the doldrums of everyday life, and reminds your faithful \naudience that you still have a sense of humor.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2000/07/25" target="_new">Claim to have invented</a> \nsomething really cool, useful, revolutionary, and <i>excellent!!</i> \nThen hype it up to the ends of the earth. Ignore the fact that there are \n<a href="http://download.cnet.com/downloads/1,10150,0-10000-103-0-1-7,00.html?tag=st%2Edl%2E10004%2Esbsr&qt=radio+station&cn=&ca=10000" target="_new">hundreds</a> of \nother applications out there that have more features, are more powerful, \nand are currently being used by tens of thousands of people. \nIf anyone <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/msgReader$19072" target="_new">questions your claim</a> to \ngreatness, shrug off the question and spin an answer. Of course, there is \n<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/default.asp" target="_new">more than one way</a> \nto put this into practice.</p></li>\n<li><p>"<a href="http://www.webstandards.org/" target="_new">Blast</a>" a large, tightly bonded community. This is a sure fire way to get attention from the group you're blasting in the form of links, flames, and more links to your site. \nIt's also a great way to generate <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-334946.html" target="_new">media hype</a> about your site!</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, if all else fails, simply  \n<a href="http://www.webmonkey.com" target="_new">let your site rot</a>. \nOddly enough, this will also generate interest in your site when your \n<a href="http://evolt.org/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=1612">once faithful members start wondering</a> \nwhat is going on and asking questions.\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, this is only a short list of the numerous options \nthat you have to generate content for your site and keep your viewers happy. \nHopefully you find some relief from these sultry summer months while you \nand your content keep - and stay - fresh!</p>
