In more simple terms and cutting through the fancy name Joint Venture Brokering is essentially where you find a product on a site and match that product with knowledgeable marketers who will, and in most cases actually want, to sell the product, making you money from the brokering of the sale. </p><p>To be a successful Broker you will need to follow some basic tricks which I have outlined for you as follows:- </p><p>Trick One: First off, just kick back, relax and make a list of all your favorite hobbies, pastimes, interests and passions. Ask yourself: </p><p>A What are you interested in? \nA are you passionate about? \nA subject or topic do you have a lot of knowledge about? \nA do people ask your advice on? </p><p>You may be worried that you do not have any specialist awareness but you need to stop and think of your life experiences. List the jobs you have done and the hobbies you have pursued or the volunteer work you may have done, all the subjects you have some interest in. </p><p>This way you will not only make money online with your brokering business but you'll enjoy working on it too! </p><p>Trick Two: From your lists in Trick One, you now need to find the websites that cover your interests etc. You then drill down these sites to find a niche market that you can broker for. For example, you may be passionate about Sports, for which there are plenty of websites. But you need to dig a little deeper and find out what exact sport niche you want to get into. You may have a particular interest, in golf for example, so this is the market you would search for suitable products to broker for. </p><p>Trick Three: Next, by using search engines and Directories find a web site that has a two-tier affiliate program for the product you are looking to broker. A two-tier affiliate programme has the first tier of commission the same as in a regular affiliate program. The difference is the additional tier(s), whereby marketers also earn a commission on sales generated by people they referred to the program. A best two-tier program will be one that: </p><p>Offers better than $10 commission per second tier sale. </p><p>Provides the marketer with ready to go marketing materials like email promotions, articles, adverts, banners etc. </p><p>Has cookie tracking system for their affiliate program, which means that even if the marketers you try to broker deals with don't sign up on the day you contact them, but sign up months later, you will still get the credit for the sales they make months down the line. </p><p>Trick Four: Is to build up a list of website domain names related to the products in your niche market saving the list where you can easily locate it. </p><p>These are likely site owners that you will be able to approach and broker a deal with. These are your marketers. </p><p>Trick Five: Using the Google search engine type in (your niche market) ezine to find thousands of sites, in your niche market that have ready-made email lists to promote to. These will be sites that publish, or are linking to another site that publishes, an ezine in your niche market. \nThese are your marketers. </p><p>Trick Six: Start going through your lists from tricks four and five and emailing the website owner or ezine publisher/owner trying to broker deals getting them to promote the site you are brokering for. This trick in itself would take you months to broker all the deals available, yet each and every deal could be worth hundreds if not thousands of dollars to you. </p><p>Trick Seven: You have now learned THE trick of making money on the internet without having your own product to sell, or without having your own website, or even without having any contacts or doing any marketing whatsoever. </p><p>Enjoy your newfound wealth and income streams and all the freedom that comes with them!<a href="http://www.jointwebventures.com">www.jointwebventures.com</a>\n<a href="http://www.jointventure.infozabout.com">www.jointventure.infozabout.com</a>
