<p>\nThere is a very interesting article called <a href="http://www.business2.com/articles/2000/03/content/0199.html" target="_blank">&quot;Minds over Matter&quot;</a>  by Don Tapscott in Business 2.0 that delves into the structures of the Net Generation and how business is changing.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe author explains that, in the new business model of tech industry, the real capital is brain power and the &quot;Knowledge Workers&quot; who posses it.  He goes on to explain how companies have to re-consider their practices in order to keep the brain power on board - since there's nothing to keep employees from going off and creating wealth for themselves (barriers to entry being the information, dedication and smarts which they posses already).\n</p>\n<p>\nIt's a thought provoking article.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href="mailto:bobd@members.evolt.org">bob</a>\n</p>\n
