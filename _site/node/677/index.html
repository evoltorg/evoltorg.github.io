          <h2>Can Long Copy On The Net Work</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Jan 2000</p>

<div class="post">
Basically: if it's interesting copy, well written copy, heck,\ninternet copy, yes. It can work.</p><p><p></p><p>Popular knowledge says long text doesn't work on the net. I\ndisagree. If used properly, it can be very effective.\nHave you ever kept reading on a webpage, and been\ndisappointed there wasn't any more?</p><p><p></p><p><h3>How not to do it</h3>\nLong text as used in newspapers or\nbooks indeed doesn't work on the net. I think most of you will\nagree with me on that. On the other hand, on some sites\ntext is just too short, and to read more you need to keep\ngoing to new pages (to show more ads?), which can be\npretty frustrating.</p><p><p></p><p>I think if you follow the \n<a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.htm">rules \nfor internet writing</a>\n(make it\nscannable, conclusions first, good subtitles, one idea per\nparagraph and so on), long texts can work pretty well. Have\na look at <a href="http://selfpromotion.com">selfpromotion.com</a> -- \nit's all text, and although it's\nnot perfect, it keeps you reading (me at least).</p><p><p></p><p><h3>So how to do it</h3>\nA few more rules that work for me: </p><p><ol>\n<li><b>keep rewriting</b>\n<p>Most writers know this, but if you're an\naverage Joe like me, this is rule number one. After writing\nsomething, let it be for a day and rewrite thoroughly. And\nthen rewrite again. And spellcheck. If you can, have\nsomebody read it (editor).</p><p><p></p><p>I think the main problem for content on the web these days\nis that people don't work hard enough on their copy (yes,\nthat includes me).\n<p>\n<li><b>conclusion first!</b> \n<p>\nPut your conclusion first. There can be\nno laps of interest (where a reader looses interest) in your\narticle, or they'll loose appetite and start clicking. So put\nthe\njuicy stuff first, and keep feeding them. (I'm gonna end this\neating metaphor right here before it gets out of hand.)</p><p><p></p><p>Will they still wanna read on if you give them the good stuff\nright away? I think they will. If you give them something\nreally good, people will want to know more about it.</p><p><p></p><p>And put content on that page! I'm always amazed by how\nmany sites want you to click 2 or 3 times before getting to\nthe good stuff. Content on the homepage!</p><p></ol></p><p><h3>Further reading</h3>\nHave a look at \n<a href="http://www.ini.cz/pearls/pearls1.htm">string of pearls</a>. It kind of\ndisagrees with all I said here, but I find it very\ninteresting.\nAnd useit.com has a classic on \n<a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html">How \npeople read on the web</a>.</p><p><p></p><p>What do you think? Can long copy really work? Does\neverything HAVE to be divided into lots of sub-pages? Why\nnot just throw it all on one page? Or should it be serial, like\nthe string of pearls pages?
