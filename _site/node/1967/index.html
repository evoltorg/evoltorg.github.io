          <h2>An Open Letter To The E Commerce Times</h2>
<p class="meta">19 May 2000</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I have read the E-Commerce Times as part of my morning ritual for over a\nyear to see what is happening on the web. I enjoy the reporting, and the\nlayout and navigation. I have recommended it to visitors to my site. I feel\nit is a valuable contribution to the web. I have used it for background\nmaterial for my own writings.</p></p><p><p>I had even installed the E-Commerce Times News ticker on the news section\nof my site.\n<a href="http://www.lemurzone.com/news/index.htm"\ntarget="_blank">http://www.lemurzone.com/news/index.htm</a></p></p><p><p>I had put it up as something that I felt would be of value to the\nvisitors to my site.</p></p><p><p><strong>This has changed.</strong><br>\nThis morning I discovered that it was attempting to set cookies.<br>\nI have removed it.<br>\nI do not believe in the use of gratuitous use of cookies.<br>\nOn e-commerce sites they are necessary and valid to enable shopping carts.\nFor login on community and discussion sites they are valid.</p>\n<p> I Believe If you build a friendly site with compelling content, visitors\nwill come to you.\nI have written a number of opinions on this issue.</p>\n<div align="right"><strong>these links will open in a new\nwindow</strong></div><br>\n<div align="right"><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/clickthru/"\ntarget="_blank">&quot;Click-Thru is Evil II&quot;<br>\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/stories/clickthru/</a></div><br></p><p><div align="right"><a\nhref="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/closingtime/index.html"\ntarget="_blank">&quot;Time to Close the Web?&quot;<br>\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/stories/closingtime/index.html</a></div><br></p><p><div align="right"><a href="http://www.lemurzone.com/edit/converse21.htm"\ntarget="_blank">&quot;Cookies in the Back Door&quot;<br>\nhttp://www.lemurzone.com/edit/converse21.htm</a></div><br></p><p><div align="right"><a href="http://www.lemurzone.com/edit/converse20.htm"\ntarget="_blank">DoubleClick Opts Out<br>\nhttp://www.lemurzone.com/edit/converse20.htm</a></div><br></p><p><p>I build websites for a living. It is my day job. It is not a hobby, nor a\nplaceholder on a resume until something better comes along.</p></p><p><p><strong>If you build a friendly site with compelling content, visitors\nwill come to you.</strong><br>\nI treat visitors as adults with the power to make their own decisions.<br>\nI do not electronically Rape them, by pushing cookies on them.</p></p><p><p>You already have an arrangement with DoubleClick to serve ads on your\nsite.\nThat is a business decision on your part.\nYou may say without this advertising revenue you could not publish what you\ndo. I have heard this argument time and time again from sites that serve\nbanner ads.</p></p><p><p><strong>This is an old argument.</strong><br> This is what is directly\nresponsible for the poor quality of network television, major magazines and\nnewspapers.</p></p><p><p><strong>It is not a valid argument for the Internet.</strong><br>\nThe majority of websites are their own advertisements. They offer\ninformation, viewpoints, commentary,  products and services without any help\nfrom banner advertisers. </p></p><p><p><strong>I would offer a counter proposal.</strong> <br>The Internet is\nalready the largest source of granular, focused, and target rich\ndestinations for finding information, discovering new resources, and\ntargeting select audiences for just about anything the human race can learn,\nis thinking  about or wants to buy.</p></p><p><p>Advertisers should be bidding for the opportunity to place ads on you\nsite, not calling the shots by tying your hands, your hearts and your\neditorial freedom  with their thirty pieces of silver.</p></p><p><p>When the advertising revenues and placements take precedence over the\ncontent of whatever medium you publish,  you have a problem. </p></p><p><p>The Internet was conceived as a collaboration tool for the exchange of\ninformation.\nIt is developing into a plaid suited hucksters bazaar of such commercialism\nthat the Federal Trade Commission is issuing regulations as fast as they can\nwrite them.</p></p><p><h3>Let's Recap</h3>\n<p>If you build a friendly site with compelling content, visitors\nwill come to you.</p>\n<p>If you build a friendly site with compelling content, visitors\nwill recommend you to their friends.</p>\n<p>If you build a friendly site with compelling content, advertisers\nwill come to you.</p></p><p><h3>The final question is:</h3>\n<p>Whose site is it anyway?<br>\nYours DoubleClicks, or some other advertising agency?<br>\nIt's your call, but it's not your Internet.</p>\n<p>alan herrell - the head lemur</p>
