<h2>Our Favourite Search Engine Just Got Better</h2></p><p><p>Just when you thought <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" title="Google.com (link opens in a new window)">Google</a> was great, it just got better.  Google has become infamous by now, after all even an evolt.org lurker would know about Google after searching <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/archive" title="thelist archives">thelist archives</a>.  A  search on Google is normally the first suggestion from people i have spoken to, and its popularity is equally evident on thelist and  from Cable TV programs such as <a href="http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/" target="_blank" title="Click to go to The Screen Savers">The Screen Savers</a> on <a href="http://www.techtv.com/" target="_blank" title="Click here for TechTv">TechTv</a>.</p><p><p>In an attempt to broaden their search, Google has made an attempt to catalog &quot;<a href="http://catalogs.google.com" target="_blank" title="Google's catalogs (link opens in a new window)">catalogs</a>&quot;.  Although there is no facility for purchase from Google, full print catalogs from cover pages to inside pages can be viewed and enlarged to show fairly detailed images of the selected catalogs' pages.  Also included are the company's contact info such as name, phone number, URL, etc.</p></p><p><p>Seems like a good move on their part, although some of the drawbacks can include lengthy download times for people who do not use broadband connections (actually mentioned in their <a href="http://catalogs.google.com/googlecatalogs/help.html#about" target="_blank" title="Google's catalog help (link opens in a new window)">help</a>) &#8212; such as the largest detailed image after drilling down a few pages <a href="http://catalogs.google.com/catalogs?q=scn_jpg:4084.com/2" target="_blank" title="Example of large image (link opens in a new window)">178kb</a>, and also the fact that the catalogs are actually only images and not text.</p>   </p><p><p>What is also neat is the fact that there are over <a href="http://catalogs.google.com/catalog_list" target="_blank" title="Google's catalog list (link opens in a new window)">600 catalogs</a> listed on the site to peruse and search.  It's free for catalog publishers to sign up at the moment, but we can expect that this service will acquire some kind of charge at some point in time, as most search engines have done.</p></p><p><Br>\n<p>profjj<br>\n<a href="http://cbizz.net/" target="_blank">http://cbizz.net</a></p>
