          <h2>Monkeyjunkies List To Shut Down</h2>

<div class="post">
<p><a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/" target="_blank">Webmonkey</a> has announced its intention to discontinue the popular Monkeyjunkies email discussion list from Monday 20th March.                  </p></p><p><p>The discussion list, a forum for designers and developers of all skill levels to exchange ideas in web design, has been a long running feature of Webmonkey. Over its lifetime, the Monkeyjunkies list has served as an invaluable tool for learning web development skills.</p></p><p><p>In a posting to the list, Webmonkey employee Jay Greenspan said that <q>this list has meant a great deal to the Monkeys,</q> and suggested alternative email forums including <a href="http://www.evolt.org/">evolt.org</a>'s <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/mailman/listinfo/thelist">thelist</a>.</p></p><p><p>The announcement has resulted in a flurry of messages&mdash;some disbelieving, others trying to determine just what had gone wrong, while others expressing their bewilderment. One member wrote: <q>I'm feeling a little bit lost. What now? I've been here off and on for about 2 years.</q></p></p><p><p>Greenspan, who has been responsible for the Monkeyjunkies list, explained that <q>after almost two great years, [I] have decided to leave Lycos. At the present time there's no choice but to cut down on items that need to be looked after.</q> Wired Digital (who operate Webmonkey) was acquired last year by <a href="http://www.lycos.com" target="_blank">Lycos</a>. Wired Digital also operates other sites including <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/" target="_blank">Wired News</a> and <a href="http://www.hotwired.com/animation/" target="_blank">Animation Express</a>.</p>
