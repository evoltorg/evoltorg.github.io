If you are still having trouble getting published, try submitting to ezines that do not pay. This may not prestigious, but it is a good place to start. This way, you can get that all-important first publication. Non-paying ezines are more likely to accept new writers. Keep plugging away, no matter the results--keep writing and keep submitting.\n<br /><br />\nThe next step can be taken as soon as you have even 1 publication. Now comes the exciting point, where we begin establishing ourselves as a writer. We're going to create a writer's Web site and step onto the world stage as a writer. We have begun building our career as an author by getting short stories published. There were two reasons for starting in this way.\n<br /><br />\nThe first reason is that even one single publication qualifies you as a published author. As soon as you are a published author, you have to start building your presence on the Internet. This is exciting, because it is the beginning of your fame. The first seminal step to what we are hoping to grow into international fame.\n<br /><br />\nThe second reason is that writing short stories helps us hone our writing skills and practice for novels. By now, you have written enough stories and gotten enough feedback from editors and your readers that you are probably a better writer than when you first began.\n
