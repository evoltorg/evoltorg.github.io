          <h2>Why Id Cards Are Critical In Today S Economic Times</h2>

<div class="post">
The unemployment rate broke 8 percent recently and we have learned from history that our crime rates climb in direct correlation with unemployment.  Due to this, businesses and organizations must protect their doors along with their reputation.  By simply adding ID cards and requiring employees to wear and display their identification cards while on the job can greatly discourage crime and enhance a company’s perception to their customers.</p><p>From 1970 to 1993 crime rose with the unemployment rate according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports.  The report goes further to show that during the period of 1992 to 1996 as the unemployment rate dropped there was a dramatic correlation in the drop of crime, particularly in poverty stricken areas.  Other reports show that nearly a 9 percent drop in burglary, a 14 percent drop in rape and robbery and nearly a 30 percent drop in assaults can be a direct result of only a 2 percent drop in unemployment.  With these statistics in mind we can assume the inverse as well.  Since 2008 we have had a 3% increase in unemployment and based on these numbers that would indicate a 13.5% increase in burglary alone in 2009.</p><p>The United States Insolvency Service stated that there was a 56% increase in insolvent businesses in the first quarter of this year over the first quarter of 2008.  That’s nearly 5,000 companies that have become illiquid in just the first quarter of 2009.  Adding to this there were over 120,000 personal and corporate bankruptcies filed last month (May 2009).  Needless to say there are a lot of newly unemployed and desperate individuals in every community.</p><p>With statistics like these it should be clear that organizations need to protect their reputation and their property.  Adding ID cards to your employees or members is a simple and effective way to enhance your security with identification.  Identification cards also add to the perception of customers when employees are out of the office and add a sense of comfort to your customers and especially your prospective customers who are new to your business.</p><p>Barcodes, biometric scanners, RFID chips and many other security features can be added to enhance the security of your ID card solution.  Technologies like these are continually becoming more affordable thanks to mass production and today’s speed of technology.  Even without these more costly solutions, simply by requiring employees and visitors to wear ID cards in your place of business can greatly add to your company’s security.  Today, thanks to the Internet, there are solutions available for both small and large companies through online security services that offer ID cards as their primary business.  Companies like FullIdentity.com have also integrated services like background checks, RFID, holograms and whatever type of technology you want to implement into the security of your identification card solution.</p><p>As consumers are spending less and watching for opportunities to save every dollar they can, business has been difficult in this economy.  Organizations need to be sure to take the best care of each customer as the search for new and repeat business becomes more difficult.  Protecting a business’s reputation by not allowing individuals to infiltrate your organization or impersonate your employee’s is critical.  ID cards can be an easy to implement and a huge factor in the verification of who someone says they are and add to a company’s credibility.
