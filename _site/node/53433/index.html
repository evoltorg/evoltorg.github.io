<p>Eric Meyer is a Standards Evangelist for Netscape Communications: he \ntries to spread the word about why standards are good and devise \nstandards-based solutions for Webmasters.</p>\n<p>He is the author of three books and a large collection of articles.</p>\n<p>Eric kindly accepted to answer some provoking questions concerning the role and the future of Cascading Style Sheets.</p>\n<p>If you are Italian, you can read the translation: "<a href="http://www.fucinaweb.com/design/ericmeyer.asp" title="Opens in a new window" target="_blank">Intervista con Eric Meyer</a>".</p></p><p><p><strong>You're delighting us with another book. What is the approach of this new manual &#8212 theoretical or practical? How did you choose your case studies? Is there a site related?</strong></p></p><p><p>The new book ("Eric Meyer on CSS") is almost entirely practical in \nnature.  It's composed of 13 projects, each of which starts with a \nsimple document and styles it in increasingly complex ways.  The text \nis written so that users can follow along with the book and see the \nproject evolve for themselves.  The base project files, as well as \nthe files that were used to produce all of the screenshots in the \nbook, are available from <a href="http://www.ericmeyeronCSS.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Eric Meyer on CSS</a>.</p></p><p><p>\nI actually created all the projects from scratch, choosing each one \nwith an eye toward exploring some aspect of using CSS.  For example, \ntwo projects deal almost exclusively with positioning, one \nconcentrates on styling for print, another looks at form styling, the \nfirst one examines converting a table-and-font design to use CSS for \nits styling, and so on.  The Web site has details on all 13 projects, \nas well as some bonus material, including some appendixes that were \ncut from the book at the last minute in order to save space.</p></p><p><p><strong>Are we ready for your book? No more tables for layout and spacer gifs...what can we say to our customers when they complain that they can't experience the site with Netscape 4.x?</strong></p></p><p><p>Well, I don't think tables are dead just yet, and the book doesn't \nreally make that claim.  What I would say is that if you use simple \ntables to lay out the main areas of a page, and then use CSS to style \nthe contents of those table cells, you'll get a decent page in \nNetscape 4.x and the intended page in more recent browsers.  I admit \nthat the book doesn't give much consideration to NN4.x but let's face \nit-- it's a five-year-old browser.  That's more than half the age of \nthe "popular Web," which was launched by the release of Mosaic 1.0. \nIts contemporary was IE3, which nobody really cares about any more.\n</p><p>\nThat said, if a Webmaster is in charge of a site that has a large \nNN4.x visitor population, then they should obviously do a little more \nto cater to that browser. The question is this: must the page look \n<i>exactly</i> the same in NN4.x as it does in IE6?  I would say no.  As \nlong as the page is readable in old browsers, it can look a little \ndifferent.  An example of this is the <a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Fox Searchlight</a> Web site.  It's not precisely the same to the \npixel in NN4.x as it is in recent browsers, but it's still usable and \nit looks pretty good.  If you didn't compare it side by side in NN4.x \nand Mozilla, for example, you probably wouldn't realize there was \nanything different.\n</p></p><p><p><strong>How complex is the learning curve for a developer coming from the old school named "Tables for layout"?</strong></p></p><p><p>It's not too bad, really.  The main obstacle is just letting go of \nalmost everything you learned when you learned table-based layout. \nWhen you move to purely CSS-based layout, there are some changes, but \nthey all make sense.  If you stick to basic tables and CSS for the \ncontent, then the learning curve is really almost flat.  Practically \nevery author I've ever met who made the transition has said that they \ncan't believe they ever messed around with complicated table-in-table \ntricks and spacer GIFs, when CSS makes things so much easier.\n</p></p><p><p><strong>Among the causes that keep developers away from adopting\nCSS in their layout, there is the buggy support of browsers. Why are browsers so buggy and in particular their CSS engines? Here are some possible causes that we want to explore with you:</strong></p></p><p><p><strong>Very few developers use CSS for layout so browser vendors don't see the need to improve their CSS support</strong></p>\n<p>\nThat may have been true in 1998, but it's completely untrue today. \nAlmost any site you can name is using CSS in some fashion.  I'll \nagree that many are using it in very limited ways, but the majority \nare using it at a moderate level at least.  Of course, some sites use \nfont tags and CSS in conjunction, which is sort of silly.  Authors \nshould use one or the other, but not both in the same design.\n</p>\n<p><strong>CSS specifications are written in English, and every language is by definition ambiguous (mostly are not bugs, but different interpretations)</strong></p>\n<p>\nThat's part of it.  There have been cases where the CSS2 \nspecification was self-contradictory, as might be expected from any \nlarge document, and others where multiple interpretations of a given \nstatement are possible.  The CSS Working Group is trying to iron out \nthose wrinkles in CSS 2.1, which is currently nearing completion, but \nany human-language document is likely to be open to interpretation.\n</p>\n<p><strong>CSS is complex and so it's complex its implementation</strong></p>\n<p>\nThis is the core problem.  CSS looks pretty simple when you first \nglance at it, but it's so sophisticated that a lot of unexpected \nbehaviors fall out of its simple rules.  In the late 1990's, vendors \ndidn't pay enough attention to the subtleties of CSS, or else just \nignored them.  Recently, they've begun fixing the mistakes they made.\n</p>\n<p><strong>CSS layout is are a relative new subject</strong></p>\n<p>\nI think CSS layout feels new because it's only been recently that \nbrowsers had advanced enough for us to even think seriously about \nsuch things.\n</p></p><p><p><strong>Sometimes it's possible to see CSS files where the author uses tricky solutions to deal with buggy browsers (import to hide CSS for Netscape 4 and comments for IE5 and Opera). Others try to detect the browser using client side or server side scripts and then send it a custom version of the CSS file. Others simply do nothing. What is your opinion?</strong></p></p><p><p>I use the @import trick to hide CSS from Navigator 4.x, so obviously \nI think such tricks have their uses.  I also use some tricks in at \nleast one of the projects in the book.  However, I do think it's easy \nto overdo it. If your stylesheet is half tricks and extra workaround \nrules, it's probably time to consider another approach to whatever \nyou're trying to do.  I've had a few designs that I scrapped because \nthey were just too advanced for current browsers without massive \ntrickery.  That happens in any medium, so it shouldn't come as a \nsurprise that it happens on the Web.\n</p>\n<p>\nPersonally, though, I'm not a fan of server-side detection.  it \nintroduces extra load on the server and it's rarely if ever needed. \nThe only cases I can think of where server-side detection is \nnecessary is if you're going to be serving up different content to \none browser versus another. If your only intention is to hand over \ndifferent CSS based on the browser, there's a good chance you're \nmaking things too complicated, and that one stylesheet would suffice.</p></p><p><p><strong>Surfing the Internet, it's possible to encounter many personal sites or blogs where the layout is ruled exclusively using CSS. However, the same didn't happen with commercial sites and in general with sites with lot of content. Wired is one of the first examples and yet suffers of some problems with validators. Is it more difficult to use CSS with complex sites? Why? What are the trade-offs?</strong></p></p><p><p>Actually, once Wired had converted to CSS-driven layout, their \nvalidation problems were all badly encoded URLs, not the markup \nitself.  They will have pages that don't validate because the page \ncontent was written three years ago, but they can also fix that \ngradually over time.  The main page of the site does validate, \nthough, or at least did as I wrote this.\n</p></p><p><p>\nIn fact, if you're doing CSS-driven layout, validation actually \nbecomes easier to achieve because your markup is simpler and more \nlogical.  Instead of wading through nested tables and TD tags, you \ncan concentrate on paragraphs and DIVs.  When I dropped tables from \nmy personal site in January of 2002, I had a much easier time with \nvalidating and correcting validation errors.\n</p></p><p><p><strong>Do you think that the CSS standard is complete or does it lack something important?</strong></p></p><p><p>CSS will never really be <i>complete</i>.  It may stop developing at some \npoint, but there will always be something it doesn't do that somebody \nwants.  For example, CSS as it stands doesn't have a way to relate \nelements to each other in layout terms-- you can't say "make this \nelement as tall as this other element."  That would be useful for \npositioning, and maybe it will be added to CSS some day, but then \nwe'll just come up with something more complex that we want to do. I \ndon't think any presentational language, no matter how complex or \npowerful, can ever cover every single thing authors will want to do.\n</p><p>\nSimilarly, whether a missing feature is important or not depends on \nwho you ask.  What I think is a critical flaw may be of no concern to \nsomeone else, just as I tend not to be bothered by what some people \nconsider important missing features.  One example is "variables"-- \nthe ability to define a keyword to mean something else, and then \nrefer to it throughout the stylesheet.  I know a few people who think \nthis is a major flaw in CSS, but it's never really bothered me.\n</p>
