          <h2>Wireless Networking For Uk Homes</h2>
<p class="meta">09 Sep 1999</p>

<div class="post">
British Telecom is to roll-out a wireless networking technology aimed at home users and small businesses.  <P>\nFrom the start of next year, users will be able to link laptops, PCs and any other digital devices without resorting to re-cabling their homes and offices. <P>\nThe system was developed by a BT-funded US start-up, Home Wireless Networks. Each device is fitted with a transmitter/receiver, which then allows it to communicate with a main controller or base station. At the heart of the system is a Wireless Gateway, which will support international standards including ADSL and ISDN. <P>\nBT estimates the technology will generate sales in excess of #35m in its first year, and predicts that more than 10 million users will sign up by 2004.  <P>
