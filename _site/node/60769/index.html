<p>There is much talk today about SEO tips and how to land higher in a SE's (Search Engine) SERPS (Search Engine Results Position). But little is talked about how properly used "White Hat" SEO techniques will inadvertently assist in website accessibility. </p></p><p><p>Most times it's very true, that marketing a websites and accessifying a website will butt heads. Accessibility states that content is king, and end-user usability/accessibility must prevail before any marketing hype - and especially any "black hat" usage. SEO has stated in the past that alls fair in love and SERPS! Accessibility was not considered, sometimes not even a option.</p></p><p><p>Well, fast forward into the ever evolving world of SEO. Content has always been prime SEO consideration, but never more than now. In fact, content - and more importantly for this article - accessible content stands as the basis for all SEO work. Next to the high priority of obtaining Incoming Back links (IBL) from that high PR (PageRank) site that drive so many SEO professionals crazy, there is, "The Copy" (The Content). </p></p><p><p>Keyword rich copy is important, yes, but now it seems more than ever, that the actual layout, or page markup, of a website, needs to be rich. Rich in accessibility. If you think about it, when a user has problems accessing a site, whether it be inaccessible navigation, or content way "below the fold" - while advertisements about Viagra are at the top of the page, what do you think a SE's searchbot will think (can they think?)</p></p><p><p>SE's are becoming much more capable in their discernment of a page or site that is targeting real people, or just trying to make an AdSense buck. So the shift has been for the good of accessibility!</p></p><p><p>When a person wants a website built for their Mom-and-Pop store, what I like to ask them is a very simple question (among many other questions of course), "Do you have an older Aunt/Uncle/relative that has a sight impairment, or do you know of anyone who suffers from any disability?" Most times, statistics tell us that they do know of a loved one who fits that category. I then launch into my "Accessibility Statement". As I evangelize the accessibility movement (Web Design Standards Movement), I most likely will get the reply of, "that sounds great...but will that help my website be on Google's top ten in one month?"</p></p><p><p>I'm sorry to say, but unless you're linked from Google itself, along with 5 other PR10 sites, you're gonna be sandboxed for awhile! But, and this is a big but, accessifying your website will most definitely help your SERPS in the long run!</p></p><p><p>Martin Espericueta has been involved in <a href="http://fiercestreetnetworks.com/">Web Standards</a> and <a href="http://search-engine-optimization-tips.fiercestreetnetworks.com/">Search Engine Optimization tips</a> for four years now.
