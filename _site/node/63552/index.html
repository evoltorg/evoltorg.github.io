          <h2>Focus On User Experience</h2>

<p>Did you know there is an ISO standard for user experience?  That’s right, a set of criteria for user experience as laid down by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  In 1999 ISO wrote it for “human-centered design processes for interactive systems”.  Numbered now as ISO924-210, it states “Ergonomics of human-system interaction, provides guidance on human-system interaction throughout the life cycle of interactive systems.”  In true bureaucratic tradition, ISO 924-210 is about as transparent as a conversation with Chewbacca. </p></p><p><p>Thankfully in 2010 that same ISO standard was re-written to define user experiences as: “a person’s perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service.”  Alright, so now the phrase ‘user experience’ means exactly what we expect it to mean.  It is subjective, easily manipulated and all about the actual use of the product by the end user. </p></p><p><p>We are quick to assume user experience applies only to digital or electronic devices, especially in the world we experience in the 21st century.  Yet at its core, the definition applies to anything; from a vegetable peeler to a tablet computer.  How the peeler feels in the hand of the user will determine if they want to use it again, or toss it in the recycle bin and go in search of a different one.  Therefore every business must focus on user experience, regardless of the digital or electronic component. </p> </p><p><p>User experience is deeply affected by three main sets of influences: past and present experience, the immediate and impending context of the item’s use, and finally the specific properties of the item in question.  From a manufacturer or designer point of view, those sets of influences present thousands of variables to navigate in finding the success of the end product.  It is not an easy, inexpensive or speedy undertaking.  Prototypes are made, tried, scrapped, and so on.  It would be so simple to skip a few demands, wouldn’t it?  Will the end user really notice if the vegetable peeler doesn’t have a firm polyurethane foam handle?  How much of a difference does it make to the user experience? </p></p><p><p>To answer those questions, let’s look at two companies whom most of us are very familiar with: Apple iPhone and Microsoft Windows Mobile.  For all those die-hard Microsoft loyalists, here are the statistics to back up what we all know is the truth – Apple won the war on mobile user experience.  According to Wi-Fi network logs continuously studied by the University of Washington (from 2007 to present), as of October 2011, iPhone holds 47% of the market share in handheld Wi-Fi devices.  Windows Mobile sits at an embarrassing 0.38%.  On a related note, the Apple market share grew 28% in 2011, while the Microsoft PC market shrank 1% (according to statistics released at the 2011 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference). </p></p><p><p>Why did this supposed underdog of a company win the battle for market share with a behemoth like Microsoft?  How on earth did they manage to cause a decrease in PC market share?  They continue to exhibit unrelenting focus on user experience, that’s why.  Sure there have been misinterpretations and mistakes resulting from them, but even users can be wrong.  The secret is in viewing users experience broadly, not pigeon-holing a particular demographic.  Don’t assume you know the user experience or the perspective of the user, because you don’t.</p></p><p><p>Building a Cracker Jack user experience requires interacting with the users, asking questions, and the ability to read between the lines (i.e. intuition).  Ask what the customer needs from the product, service or system.  What ideas already in hand will help fulfill those needs?  Are the designs easy to use?  Is the impact of the design or product positive?  Or does it hurt the brand?  Now here is the tough one:  is the design intuitive for the user?  Does it fit how they think? </p></p><p><p>Word of mouth is huge, especially negative word of mouth.  Plus, anyone who has ever been the subject of or a part of the gossip chain knows just how fast and furious it goes.  Why subject your brand reputation to ugly reviews just because you didn’t pay enough attention to user experience?  Ask yourself what will cost more, recovery of the brand or another prototype.  Be Apple, focus on user experience.</p>
