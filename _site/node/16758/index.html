For Salon, it was the first step in moving to a <a href="http://www.salon.com/premium/intro/index.html" title="All about Salon Premium">subscription-heavy model</a>, with the bigger ads and interstials mixed into the free site.</p></p><p><p>Slashdot, grand-pappy to all those post-and-comment&ndash;community sites, said it will also <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/10/22/1814211" title="CmdrTaco makes the announcement">adopt the bigger ads</a>.
