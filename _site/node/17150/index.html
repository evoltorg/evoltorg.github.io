<div class="post">
<p>I recently purchased a product from Zend's website and was given the Zend IDE along with it for free. I figured "What the heck, it's free and all..." So I installed the Zend IDE and began using it....</p>\n<h3>The pros:</h3>\n<p>I think it's a nice editor with good coloring and auto-tabbing when using brackets. This simple, easy to use editor will give you an easy way to write php and html. </p>\n<h3>The cons:</h3>\n<p>The code completion and syntax are total BS.  The completion only works on some accessory items like <code>&lt;?php</code>. Leave it sitting at <code>mysql_</code> and it will pop up nothing. As for syntax, it is offered but you have to select your code and it will bring up a webpage with the syntax. Not what you'd expect with many IDEs supporting floating tool-tip type syntax. </p>\n<p>Secondly the program being written in java acts kind of flaky on my machine. I don't know if this has to do with my client version or what, but it gets annoying. For example, if you click with the mouse it momentarily whites out a block the size of the cursor. Or if you scroll the code it will sometimes get "jaggy" and you will have to wait a sec for it to display right again.</p>\n<h3>Final Opinion:</h3>\nI think that if you can get around the lack of help features and the screen weirdness this is a very usable editor; of course, so is edit.  Bottom line: don't spend $250 on this product.</p>
