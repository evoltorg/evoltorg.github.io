          <h2>Joker Com Gets Even Cheaper</h2>

Ever since I heard about Joker.com's <a href="http://www.w3nation.com/features/news/cheapdomains.htm">cheap domain registration</a>, I've registered my domains there. They've all gone smoothly, and registrations are complete in just a couple hours. In addition to their cheap rates, their system is entirely web-based. I can go in and change my contact information, my nameserver IP address, or any of the zone contacts all inside a web browser. No more quirky email forms like Network Solutions insists on using, they're doing it right.\n<p>\nTheir main selling point has been their cheap rates. They debuted with $20/yr. registrations, and due to currency exchanges, I've found their actual rates to be anywhere from $19-22 a year. But Joker.com is going to go even cheaper.\n<p>\nI received an email today from Joker.com saying that starting January 16, 2000, their two year rates will fall from 70 DM (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/m5?a=70&s=DEM&t=USD">currently about $36</a>, or $18/yr.)to 60 DM, which will be bring the cost of domain registration to <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/m5?a=60&s=DEM&t=USD">about $15 USD</a> per year. Also, they will be offering domain registrations that are effective from 1 year to 10 years! Imagine, no more annoying renewal notices every 2 years, you could own a domain until 2010.\n<p>\nJoker.com is doing everything right, things that Network Solutions could do if they took customer service and customer satisfaction seriously. I've yet to find a problem that I can't fix myself through their web-based admin system, and I'm going to continue registering domains with them.\n<p>
