          <h2>Survey Exposes Online Shopping Habits</h2>

A joint survey by BizRate.com and the NPD Group, questioning 10,000 \nonline shoppers, has discovered that 75% had abandoned a loaded \nshopping cart prior to payment. Most of us have done it - whether \nwe're simply curious about shipping charges, interested in checking \nout the technology behind an ordering process, or just unimpressed \nwith the final price of goods. What is important for owners of \necommerce sites, and their developers, is that millions of dollars \nin potential revenue are being lost - perhaps simply because shop \nowners lack awareness of what happens in the post-product-choice \nphase.</p><p>The survey observes that 24% of consumers were unhappy with \nexpensive postage and handling charges, and 17% mentioned that they \nlater bought the same goods offline and free of shipping costs.</p><p>26% shopped around, and bought goods from a competitor.</p><p>To be noted, however, is that more than half of the respondents \nlater returned to the store at which they originally abandoned the \ncart, and the majority of those made eventual purchases. This is \npossibly indicative of customers including shipping costs in their \nprice comparisons, or generally being more wary of online shopping.</p><p>Regardless, online merchants could take a hit and reduce shipping \ncosts, but in turn, gain a customer.</p><p>Links:\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.newswire.com.au/9910/shopaba.htm">A Newswire article about the survey</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.bizrate.com/">BizRate.com</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.npd.com/">the NPD Group</a></li>\n</ul>
