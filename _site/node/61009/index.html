Payment Gateway is a software interface between a web-based shopping cart and a merchant account. Itâ€™s an e-commerce application service provider service that authorizes payments for e-businesses, online retailers, bricks and clicks, or traditional brick and mortar. </p><p>Security:\nSecurity is most important Section for online gateways like Pay pal & eBay. \nFor that in 2007, PayPal introduced an optional security key that adds an additional layer of protection when logging into PayPal or eBay accounts. A security Key is a may be just like a physical device that an authorized user of computer services is given to aid in authentication. A user account tied to a security key has a modified login process; once the user enters their normal login ID and password, they are prompted to press a button on the security key, and then enter the six-digit number generated by the key to complete the login process. This two-factor authentication (T-FA) prevents an account from being compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key. If a user loses their security key, they can authenticate by providing their credit card or bank account number listed on their account. \nT-FA is an authentication factor is a segment of information and process used to substantiate or verify a person's identity for security purposes. Several products store passwords in plain text for either the token or smart card software or its associated management server. The option of adding a security key to one's account is currently available only to users registered in the United States, Germany and Australia.</p><p>Regards, \nwhites\nwww.oscommerceexperts.com\n
