<p>One of the first to introduce affiliate programs to search engines was Goto.com, but now others have come into the market. Companies are obviously seeing these search affiliate programs (paying Web site owners a small fee for adding a search box to their site) as yet another way to increase their userbase.</p></p><p><p>Direct Hit and Lycos have recently joined the fray; now you can get two cents for one search or three for other options. Direct Hit also pays 3 cents for a search. Once you have gathered $50, you get a cheque (that equals about 1700 clicks).</p></p><p><p>A new company in this field is FindWhat.com, offering services quite similiar to Goto.com.</p></p><p><p>This may not be an option to increase your bank account in all cases, but for some (who might already have search engine boxes at their site) it should be of interest.</p></p><p><p><ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.goto.com/d/ssn/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">GoTo.com Search On Your Site</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.directhit.com/affiliate/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Direct Hit Affiliate Program</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.lycos.com/affiliateprogram/" target="_blank">Lycos Affiliate Program</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.findwhat.com/static/affiliate_idx.html" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Add FindWhat Search to Your Site</a></li>\n</ul></p>
