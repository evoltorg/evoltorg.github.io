          <h2>Posturing For Higher Profits</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Mar 2006</p>

<div class="post">
<p align="left">You are in business to accomplish several goals. The main goal, and rightfully so, is to make a </p><p>profit! Seems like a simple enough end result for all of the hard work you and your teams have poured into your </p><p>business craft. </p>\n<p align="left">Well, perhaps not, especially if your firm's basics are in disarray. Without a concrete process, </p><p>without objectives that are executable, and without management accountability, profit may be a lofty goal </p><p>continually strived for but rarely obtained. </p>\n<p align="left"><strong>Software Solution </strong></p>\n<p align="left">To realize profitable projects, to ensure internal efficiencies and tasks remain on track, a </p><p>fully integrated project management system is, especially these days, mandatory for most business operations. </p><p>Software that manages project planning is usually comprised of two methodologies: a complete, turnkey system, or </p><p>one that is modularized. The former affords a company a total project management system that incorporates all of </p><p>the nuts and bolts, while the latter modularizes various project planning components. </p>\n<p align="left">No matter the type of software employed, a write-once system is preferable. Such reduces input </p><p>errors and definitely improves the integrity of the data being examined. If your software can also bring into </p><p>play your customer data, you've avoided the dreaded input error bug that can skew your final reports. </p>\n<p align="left">Most integrated project <a href="http://www.teaminteractions.com/">management or project planning </p><p>software </a> systems offer charts, graphs and reports. What is of interest to management is that the system also </p><p>facilitates the communicative and collaborative aspects of the projects. Workgroup centralization for clients and </p><p>project co-workers is important in managing the entire process from start to finish. </p>\n<p align="left">The software solution must also be able to meet the demands of the end-user and the customer. </p><p>Sometimes these demands can occur quite suddenly. Unresponsive software or a truculent program module that cannot </p><p>flex around suddenly imported difficulties becomes an anchor that weighs heavily on the company's bottom line. </p><p></p>\n<p align="left">A well-tooled project planning software system also minimizes the need for additional development </p><p>work on the system itself. Training employees and consultants on the use of the software should be, if not </p><p>effortless, worth the investment. When time and money are saved, and valuable resources can be applied to the </p><p>projects in a more immediate fashion, a “win-win” situation occurs for both client and company. </p>\n<p align="left"><strong>Reporting Results </strong></p>\n<p align="left">A complete project management software system will be able to grow with the company and report </p><p>all of the required data quickly and accurately. The system should be able to handle: </p></p><p><div align="left">\n  <ul>\n    <li>Unlimited projects and tasks as well as track all project aspects such as hours logged, project costs, </p><p>what has been billed and what remains to be billed </li>\n      <li>Billings accomplished in light of the project budget </li>\n      <li>Detailed work logs for each client and all related support issues </li>\n      <li>Specific resource assignments to the project's various tasks </li>\n      <li>Budget comparison reports in relation to spending </li>\n      <li>Tracking and setting project budgets </li>\n      <li>Document management, plans and process flows within a complete record of the project </li>\n      <li>Changeable levels of access to the data via role-based permissions for different users </li>\n      <li>Billing rates that can be varied when associated with different project consultants </li>\n      <li>Incorporation of a calendaring component </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<p align="left">With a complete system, the approval process becomes far easier for managers. They can review the </p><p>project status at any time they wish, view charges, and approve time and expenses to keep the project on track. </p><p>With the single project management software system in place, accountability becomes a reality. </p>\n<p align="left"><strong>A View To Success </strong></p>\n<p align="left">The last element any project manager wishes to experience is project management software that </p><p>adds complexity to administrative efforts. Additionally, the software should be fully capable of presenting a </p><p>visual status of the projects underway without the necessity of a manager having to cull through reams of reports </p><p>for an overview. A plus also occurs when management is able to view a project from the “hundred-thousand mile </p><p>altitude” level, as new perspectives can be realized and applied to increase flexibility and apply new company </p><p>capabilities in completing the projects. </p>\n<p align="left"><strong>Endgame </strong></p>\n<p align="left">The goal of software should be to streamline the entire project management process. When the </p><p>updating of tasks can be handled quickly and still result in the acquisition of complete detail levels, a </p><p>triumphant conclusion is the much-sought consequence. </p>\n<p align="left">The result of successful project planning is a satisfied customer. A satisfied customer, under </p><p>most circumstances, will return to the company that has already proven they can meet client needs. Both the </p><p>client and the company win! </p>\n
