<p>\n<a href="http://www.webcms.org" title="webcms.org homepage" target="_new">www.webcms.org</a> was created to provide unbiased information on Web content management tools, processes and standards. webcms.org will feature a free monthly article as well as longer reports for sale periodically. The August article is <a href="http://www.webcms.org/articles/article_aug01.html" target="new">"Understanding the Complete Web Lifecycle"</a> and emphasizes the importance of establishing and standardizing workflow processes through the entire publishing lifecycle.</p>\n<p>\nWe also maintain a list of vendors with Web content management products on the market. In order to remain unbiased, we will not be instituting reviews and rankings. However, we do plan to expand the list into a product characteristic matrix, where users can sort and compare products themselves by an extensive range of criteria.</p>\n<p>\nLet us know what you think. We're always making enhancements and changes to the\nsite as we receive feedback, so your comments are very welcome. Please take a look at <a href="http://www.webcms.org" title="webcms.org homepage" target="_new">our website</a> for more information.\n</p>
