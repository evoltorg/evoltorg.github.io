          <h2>Disney Fulfils Toysmart Com S Privacy Promise</h2>
<p class="meta">10 Jan 2001</p>

<div class="post">
<p>When Disney-owned <a href="http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2000/05/22/technology/toysmart/index.htm">toysmart.com closed its routers last year</a>, it generated <a href="http://slashdot.org/yro/00/07/03/0344243.shtml">substantial anger by trying to sell off its customer database to pay off its creditors</a>. Why? Because its privacy policy stated very clearly that it would never transfer customer records to a third party.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow in the UK, this wouldn't have been possible because we have <a href="http://www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980029.htm" title="Data Protection Act 1998"><em>real</em> data protection legislation</a>. However, the US federal bankrupcy court doesn't see it that way, and was insisting that the database, as an asset, be sold.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, in a breathtaking moment of good sense, <a href="http://cnnfn.cnn.com/2001/01/09/technology/wires/toysmart_wg/">another Disney subsidiary will pay toysmart $50,000 to destroy the database</a>.\n<p>\nResult: Creditors happy with the money. Customers happy with the privacy. Disney happy with the positive PR. World+Dog looks on and cheers.\n</p>
