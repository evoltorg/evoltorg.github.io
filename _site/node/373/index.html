For you "evolutionaries" in the Los Angeles area, please join the L.A. Chapter of the Internet Society for our next meeting:<br>Main Program Topic: Intranets<P>\nSept 14, 1999  7:00 pm (but come 6-6:30 for pre-meeting activities) <P>\nGlendale Career College 1015 Grandview Avenue,  Glendale, CA 91201 <P>\nCommunity Education Series Intranets: At Home and as The basis for eBusiness <P>\n<P>\nNetworks are coming home. Why? Many of the same reasons you do at work: Share a fast Internet connection - Share file space - Share databases - Work on projects together - and things we have not thought of yet. Now the question is how to build your own network and get all of these benefits. <P>\nSince we're on the subject of Intranets and, since there is a major push to get into the business of eCommerce, we will have a short discussion of the importance of our company's preparedness to take full advantage of e-Technologies, including its Intranet.   What allows or facilitates a company to be able to be a successful eBusiness?   Location  Glendale Career College,  1015 Grandview Avenue, Glendale, CA 91201 1-800-498-1818 or 1-818-243-1131 <P>\nCost  Admission and parking FREE <P>\nPlease visit <a href='http://www.success.edu' target="_new">http://www.success.edu</a> for more information and driving directions. <P>\nSee our website for more info on our organization: <a href='http://www.isoc-losangeles.org/' title='LA ISOC home page' target="_new">http://www.isoc-losangeles.org/</a>  <P>\n    <P>
