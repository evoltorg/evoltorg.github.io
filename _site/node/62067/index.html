<b>What are MKV files</b>?<br/>\n.MKV is a container format developed by Matroska. <br/>\n<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3443864938_888ea07f85_t.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="mkv format" /><br/>\nIt can hold different types of video and audio. For example, there might be an .AVI file contained within the .MKV file.<br/>\nThe Matroska Multimedia Container is an open standard free Container format, a file format that can hold an unlimited number of video, audio, picture or subtitle tracks inside a single file. It is intended to serve as a universal format for storing common multimedia content, like movies or TV shows. Matroska is similar in conception to other containers like AVI, MP4 or ASF, but is entirely open in specification, with implementations consisting mostly of open source software. Matroska file types are .MKV for video (with subtitles and audio), .MKA for audio-only files and .MKS for subtitles only. High Definition movies in 720 or 1080 pixel width format are often encoded and packaged as a Matroska format video with a .mkv file extension.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>How to play MKV files on Mac</b>?<br/>\n<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">MPlayer OS X</a> and <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC Media Player</a> both are free cross-platform multimedia player.<br/>\n<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3312/3444124340_307537867d.jpg" width="250" height="100" alt="players" /><br/>\nThese excellent and free multimedia players can tackle many of the video formats unknown to QuickTime.
