If you are like me and you try to avoid having to maintain one CSS file for IE and another for non-IE, here is a new little trick I figured out that may be helpful in regards to sprites.  For this article to make sense you must have a preliminary understanding of CSS sprites, furthermore I've only tested it in IE7 and FF3.\n<br /><br />\nThe challenge is to have an image in a sprite to get positioned equally on IE and and FireFox let's say.  Normally the dirty solution would be to code an exception.  The one problem is that the <i>!important</i> is not recognized in some IE7 versions.  So while it is easy to trick the browser in IE6 with <i>!important</i>, no such luck in IE7.  The other constraint is that we want to minimize maintenance cost, so we want to try to keep only one CSS file.\n<br /><br />\nLet's examine the problem by example.\n<br /><br />\n<code>\n  .class {\n          background: white url('/images/sprite.gif') no-repeat;\n          background-position: 0px -82px !important;\n          background-position: 0px -79px;\n         }\n</code>\n<br />\nThe above is what we would normally be inclined of doing.  We might even want to replace the dimensions to <i>em</i> with same undesired results.  Using two CSS files would make the situation even more messy. \n<br /><br />\nThe solution is quite simple actually:  We change the dimensions to a <b>percentage</b>!\n<br /><br />\nThat's right, we will simply have to change the unit to <i>%</i> and surprisingly it yields same results in both browsers.  The only caveat is that positive percentage moves the image up, and negative percentage moves the image down - in other words the opposite to the usual behavior when <i>px</i> or <i>em</i> is used.\n<br /><br />\nA look at the new code would look something like:\n<br /><br />\n<code>\n  .class {\n          background: white url('/images/sprite.gif') no-repeat;\n          background-position: 0px 105%;\n         }\n</code>\n<br />\nI hope this will prove helpful as it has helped me.\n
