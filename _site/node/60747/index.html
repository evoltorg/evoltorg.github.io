First of all excuse me for my a little bit rusty english (i`m from germany) but i hope u will understand the facts. lets make it short and easy ... if u make a website with PHP u know this:</p><p>www.domain.com/index.php?thing=thingy</p><p>its not really enjoyable for searchengines they like much more statical URLs. k then lets give them what they want! in most cases we will work with mod-rewrite but on one hand its hard to handle and sometimes your provider don´t allow it, so what is to do?</p><p>the magic-words are "DirectoryIndex" and "FilesMatch".</p><p>in your .htaccess file u write for example:</p><p><code>\nDirectoryIndex eng.php\n</code></p><p>that says the server to use that file as index, so the server is not looking for an index.html anymore. now u need to add:</p><p><code>\nOptions +Multiviews\n<FilesMatch "^eng$">\nForceType application/x-httpd-php\n</FilesMatch>\n</code></p><p>this tell the server to search in the URL for "eng" and handle it as a PHP-File. "eng" is just an example u can use\nany word what u want. so that means if we have the following URL:</p><p>www.domain.com/eng/thingy.html  (btw looks nice or? :-)</p><p>the server don`t search for "thingy.html" in the directory "eng", the server now\nhandle that URL as:</p><p>www.domain.com/eng.php...</p><p>k thats not bad but how can WE handle that with PHP? Nothing easier like that.\nAdd at least to your .htaccess ...</p><p><code>\nAcceptPathInfo On\n</code></p><p>... and now we are in the game! In our PHP-File (in this example with the name eng.php)\nwe get all informations we need with that:</p><p><code>\n$InfoArray = explode('/', ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']));\n</code></p><p>and now we have an array with informations like this:</p><p><code>\n$InfoArray[0] = "eng";\n$InfoArray[1] = "thingy.html";\n</code></p><p>the first we don´t need but the second is interesting, just make a little "replace" like\nthis (the .html doesn`t matter u can name it what ever u want):</p><p><code>\n$InfoArray[1] = str_replace('.html', '', $InfoArray[1]);\n</code></p><p>now we have the information we want ... the name of the page:</p><p><code>\n$InfoArray[1] = "thingy";\n</code></p><p>and we can start working with that. we can make all kind of pages what we want and the\nsearchengines will love it and think its statical. so what it looking better?</p><p>this?\nwwww.domain.com/index.php?thing=thingy</p><p>or this?\nwww.domain.com/eng/thingy.html</p><p>i think the searchengines give u the answer ;-)</p><p>thank u for your attantion. have a good time and enjoy your life.</p><p>\n
