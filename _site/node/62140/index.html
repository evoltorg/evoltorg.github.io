Being a technical component, tables are highly vulnerable to corruption due to file system corruption, simultaneous execution of more than two employees, MS Office malfunctioning, virus infection and more. Once the table gets corrupted due to any of the above reasons, then the data stored in it either shows wrong records or you encounter an error message. To overcome these hazards, an ideal solution is to restore the data from an updated backup.
