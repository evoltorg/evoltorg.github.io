Some of you might know Thunderlizard as one of the most known shows of the business. The tickets are not cheap, so it is not as easy to attend for anybody. A good teaser they have is the offer of the handouts of the people referrering. <P>\nAt <A HREF="http://www.thunderlizard.com/dwnld_handout.html">their website</A> you can download their handouts. I downloaded some, because the titles were interesting and just had a short look, but this is enough for all you Coders, PR and Marketing gurus, Photoshop addicts to go over and check it out yourself. I thought some might be interested..this is the only way I can anyway.. (if someone from Thunderlizard wants to welcome some Evolts..give us a mail) <P>
