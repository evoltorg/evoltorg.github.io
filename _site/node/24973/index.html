          <h2>Community News For April</h2>
<p class="meta">30 Apr 2002</p>

<div class="post">
<p>\nAnother month gone, another stack of accomplishments by the evolt.org community.  As a reminder, this is open to anyone in the community, so if you missed a chance to <a href="http://evolt.org/contact/index.html">toot</a> your horn, add a comment, and watch for the announcement for next month's news.\n</p></p><p><h2>evolt.org</h2></p><p><p>\nThree interesting tidbits this month about the community you love to parse.\n</p></p><p><p>\nSpeaking of <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org" title="Wanna surf like cro magnon man?">browsers.evolt.org</a> (keep up already), a big thanks out to Harley Jacoubsen for providing archives of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 through 6.0 for win32, including some service packs.  Some of you may recall that we've been trying to get fully-functioning, self-contained versions of those browsers forever.  Now we've got 'em.  They went up this past weekend, adding some 518MB to the overall browser archive, which now weighs in at just over three solar masses.\n</p></p><p><p>\nThe final touches have been put on the evolt.org case study to be featured in a book by glasshaus slated for May release titled <em>Usability: The Site Speaks for Itself</em>.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1904151035/evoltorg" target="_new" title="Amazon, for one, is selling it; opens in new window.">Pre-order your copy today</a> and see funny pictures of the authors who wrote about sites like evolt.org, MetaFilter, Google, and others.\n</p></p><p><p>\n<a href="http://louisrosenfeld.com/home/" target="_blank">Lou Rosenfeld</a> and \n<a href="http://www.semanticstudios.com/" target="_blank">Peter Morville</a> are \nalso in the final touches of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596000359/evoltorg" target="_blank">second \nedition</a> for their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565922824/evoltorg" target="_blank">O'Reilly \nbook on Information Architecture</a>. In this second edition they are including \na case study of evolt.org where Lou presents a very novel and eye opening approach \nto the Information Architecture of our beloved community. <a href="http://evolt.org/user/marlene/21/index.html"><strong>Marlene</strong></a> \nand <a href="http://evolt.org/user/mantruc/138/index.html"><strong>mantruc</strong></a> had the \nchance to read the chapter and give some feedback, and they can tell us that it \ntalks very well of us, so be prepared for a huge troop of new members once it \nhits the bookstores.\n</p></p><p><h2>Evoltspottings</h2>\n<p>All over the web, people are looking to see what evolters have to say, and sometimes they point their users back to the source. Here are some of the pointers, all noticed this month</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0402c.html#larva">Zeldman.com</a> pointed readers over to <a href="/user/aardvark/88/index.html"><strong>Aardvark</strong></a>'s <a href="/article/roundup/1/22708/index.html">End of the free content ride?</a> article</li>\n<li><a href="/user/martinb/32/index.html"><strong>MartinB</strong></a>'s <a href="/article/roundup/20/23583/index.html">article on Zope blogging</a> got spotted and referenced by <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/09#lca6a1f44bcfbc44da362602ea77d146a" target="_new" title="Opens in a new window">compulsive blog evangelist Dave Winer</a></li>\n<li><strong>Brian King</strong>'s <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/archive/Week-of-Mon-20010709/036823.html">architect's client metaphor</a> got reposted on <a href="http://board.flashkit.com/board/showthread.php?threadid=172581&highlight=evolt" target="_new"  title="Opens in a new window">Flashkit</a>\n</li>\n<li><a href="http://talkgraphics.infopop.net/1/OpenTopic?a=tpc&s=98519178&f=650193141&m=5051974331" target="_new"  title="Opens in a new window">TalkGraphics</a> described thelist as having <q><i>many cold fusion people on and are all extremely helpful.</i></q></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to the many people who have taken the time to cite evolt.org in their own work</p></p><p><h2>Evolt's direction</h2>\n<p>\nAs a reminder to all members, feel free to take part in the future (and even current) direction of evolt.org over at <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/mailman/listinfo/theforum">theforum</a>.  As I write this, there's lots of good discussion going on, and your voices need to be heard.\n</p></p><p><h2>Duette evolticon in Santiago</h2></p><p><p>Last week, <a href="http://evolt.org/user/djc/5/index.html">djc</a> visited \n  <a href="http://evolt.org/user/mantruc/138/index.html">javier</a> in <a href="http://sunsite.dcc.uchile.cl/chile/turismo/santiago.html" target="_blank">Santiago \n  de Chile</a>. It was very shocking (and relieving) for mantruc to get to meet \n  an evolt.org member in the flesh, and finally have evidence that they (you) \n  all DO exist in real life, outside of his head and monitor. Dan and Jenny were \n  there for a week -which is a very short time to visit such a varied country- \n  but the hosts Pilar and javier managed to have them visit as many places as \n  possible is such a short timeframe, and have them enjoy (in true evolt gluttony \n  stlye) of the local food and wine goods (mainly centered towards seafood, given \n  the visitors' veggie habits) of their country. At arrival they were so exhausted \n  from the 17-hour flight that they slept over a mild-to-considerable earthquake.</p>\n<p>After Dan and Jenny toured around the neurotic <a href="http://www.chiptravel.cl/region/santiago/santiago_index.htm" target="_blank">capital</a> \n  of the country, where Dan wasn't able to perform his famous traffic-stopping \n  act (they hardly stop at pedestrian crosses), the four adventurers joined for \n  a crazy weekend passing to the winery of <a href="http://www.conchaytoro.com/" target="_blank">Concha \n  y Toro</a> and it's famous Cellar of the Devil (Casillero del Diablo), a flash \n  tour along the central coast, sleeping at the &quot;historical&quot; location \n  of Algarrobo (where mantruc was when the evolt.org name and logo came to life), \n  and the famous port of <a href="http://www.chiptravel.cl/region/santiago/valpo.htm" target="_blank">Valparaiso</a>, \n  where they visited the <a href="http://www.rionegro.com.ar/arch200201/c11j01.html" target="_blank">museum</a> \n  at the house of the <a href="http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/1971/neruda-bio.html" target="_blank">Nobel \n  winning</a> poet <a href="http://www.uchile.cl/neruda/fundacion.html" target="_blank">Neruda</a>, \n  with all his lovely sense of play.</p>\n<p>Then the &quot;crazy gringos&quot; headed towards the ever-lovely southern \n  town of <a href="http://www.pucon.com/index_ing.htm" target="_blank">Pucon</a> \n  and enjoyed some hot springs, and yet more food. On their way back they were \n  surveyed for the <a href="http://www.censo2002.cl/index.htm" target="_blank">national \n  census</a>, which takes place every 10 years, and then headed back home to Wisconsin, \n  wow what a ride! </p></p><p><h2>Our members</h2></p><p><h3>Paul Cowan</h3></p><p><p>Australian evolter <a href="http://evolt.org/user/mino/9977/index.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in a new window">Paul Cowan</a> is the very proud Dad of a shiny new baby\ngirl, the extremely gorgeous Alice Kallista Gemmell Cowan, born on the 7th of March.

His new job is as \n  Information Architect - Web Designer for a <a href="http://www.latercera.cl/" target="_blank">big \n  news company</a>. They are working on a very interesting project but he can't \n  disclose more because it's secret.</p></p><p><h3>Joshua Olson</h3>\n<p>On April 30, Joshua became a father (for the first time) of a baby girl.  7lb 4oz (3.289 kg).
