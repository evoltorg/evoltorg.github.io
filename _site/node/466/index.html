<div class="post">
Embattled Canadian software startup, <a href="http://www.privacyx.com/">PrivacyX</a>, is \nasking for support from open source volunteers to secure its applications which hope to \noffer secure and private email, web surfing and chatting.</p><p>In late August, cryptographer Ian Goldberg posted a page - <a \nhref="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu/noprivacyx.html">About to lose your PrivacyX</a>  \n- which showed the allegedly secure browser as being, well, not all that secure. \nPrivacyX's attempted cheap fix (as outlined in the September 2 update to Goldberg's \npage), was discovered by Goldberg, and it seems PrivacyX have decided that an open \nsource path might work for the software.</p><p>Douglas Whorrall, President of PrivacyX.Com Solutions, Inc, notes that "It invariably \nhappens when software is released for public consumption that some problem with the code \narises or an insecurity is found."</p><p>He believes that the "best way to build a product that has the best interest of users at \nheart and the highest quality of security and performance" is to get potential users \ninvolved with development. Any developers interested in the product, or privacy issues \nmay wish to visit PrivacyX's <a href="http://www.browser.privacyx.com">Open Source \nAnonymous Browsing Project</a>.</p><p>\nFor more information, read PrivacyX's <a \nhref="https://www.privacyx.com/company/09271999a.html">press release</a> or <a \nhref="http://www.wired.com/news/news/slashdot/technology/story/21982.html">Wired's view \nof it all</a>.
