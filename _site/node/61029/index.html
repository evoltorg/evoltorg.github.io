          <h2>Why Should You Write An Ebook For Free</h2>
<p class="meta">09 Sep 2008</p>

<div class="post">
I am yet to write my first eBook. I had been postponing it for quite sometime now for some reasons or other. It is not I schedule even for next one month.</p><p>All that I am doing is shuttling between hospital and my home office. I actually enjoy both places. Had it been any other job I would have quit it long time back but being a doctor does give different kind of satisfaction.</p><p>\nBut I am aware that I have not produced an eBook and would include this in my next monthly scheduling.</p><p>When I entered into internet business in 2003 (Well! It was more of learning by trial for next two years rather than business) I saw eBooks being published everywhere on the net and being sold on premium prices.</p><p>Everyday there would be an email announcing arrival of new secret laden book.</p><p>But scenes have changed now. You would hardly make any money with an eBook these days, until you are a big name with big clout when you can emotionally charge your customers with sweet talk and copywriting, only to be disillusioned later.</p><p>You cannot put a premium price on your eBook too. Its pass√©.\nHow can you utilize an eBook you write?</p><p>Exposure</p><p>if it is free, it is going to be seen, read and passed on by a lot of people. This helps in building your brand and reputation. If you have your backend strategies in place you would be rewarded manifolds.</p><p>Traffic</p><p>EBooks drive traffic. And a lot of that traffic. If you have a lot of eBooks circulating in the market with back links pointing to your website, you would have an ample traffic. How you convert that is up to you and your website.</p><p>When you write an eBook, you become a cut above those who have not. That puts you ahead of many people. A good thing to happen</p><p>Conversation</p><p>EBook can increase conversation on your blog. Make a post on the blog regarding a=the eBook and then in the eBook itself, post a request for feedback. There go you rocking post.</p><p>Conversion</p><p>you can get highly motivated buyers in your eBooks who would buy the stuff you recommend. A good way to increase the sales.</p><p>Practice.</p><p>You need to write regularly to produce that perfection. EBooks give you a great platform to practice. More you write, better you become. Writing articles for blogs or article directories is different. Writing eBook is different. You need to remove many reputations, divide in chapters and create a book out of your segmented content.</p><p>List</p><p>EBook can be a great list building tool. All you need is to put a link to your squeeze page.</p><p>Become an Expert</p><p>I think that is an obvious one.</p><p>That makes me thinking again. Why am I delaying it?\n
