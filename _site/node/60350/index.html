<p>\n	A common dilemma facing businesses large and small alike is how best to equip \n	their staff to deliver the largest amount of productivity, weighed against \n	the increasing costs of the technology necessary to deliver that productivity. \n	Lately there seems to be no shortage of new technology, including a multitude \n	of pagers, cell phones, and Blackberry-esque devices to choose from based \n	on a company's fancy... or budget.\n</p></p><p><p>\n	There is a difference, however, between the myriad of choices available to \n	consumers and whether or not the correct device exists for one's needs. \n	A pager, almost an antiquated device these days, only lets its user know \n	of a short message or phone number to regard; a cell phone is usable only \n	when a strong enough signal is available, and Blackberry-type devices are \n	great for two-way communication via email and telephony, but present very \n	real cost hurdles.\n</p></p><p><p>\n	Let's put cost hurdles aside for the sake of argument. Granted, that's \n	a loaded request, as if we could so easily disregard the cost of items, \n	we would have little dilemma about which technology to implement to meet \n	our needs. Try it though, you'll like it.\n</p></p><p><p>\n	Clearly a fully-functioning computer is going to offer the most amount \n	of flexibility and communication potential, save for the use of a telephone.\n	Email and messaging capabilities are often the most efficient way of sending \n	information to large groups at once; whereas the telephone offers speed of \n	connectivity, provided you have a clear signal and your recipient is able to \n	answer the call. The natural extension of these two technologies ends up as \n	a melding of each, into one device. If presented with a colleague who \n	won't/can't/doesn't answer the telephone, send an email message; if you \n	can't be bothered to type anything more than a few characters, create a \n	&quot;call me @ 555-1212&quot; message and tap Send; if you need to send \n	a file while sitting in traffic, pen a real email with an attachment.\n</p></p><p><p>\n	Additionally, it's important to not load down your workers with a \n	multitude of devices. They have to want to use what's issued to them \n	because it makes their job easier, faster, better, six-million-dollar-man-like, \n	not reach for five different pieces of electronics strapped to various places \n	on their body. They'll have to work on relying on a new piece of equipment in \n	addition to their everyday computer, but won't have to carry several different \n	things to get their jobs done. As a business, you'll have to work on justifying \n	the costs, both intellectual and actual, of rolling out a new technology. \n	Fortunately for you, a few of those justifications are below.\n</p></p><p><h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<p>	\n	Access not only to information, but to people as well. The file does you no good \n	without context. The person does you no good without the detail contained in \n	the file. Miss one, and you miss meeting the deadline, signing the contract, \n	closing the deal. There was a meeting scheduled for this afternoon... your managers \n	didn't know to attend because they were attending other meetings and weren't \n	next to the laptop. The client calls and says everything is perfect except for \n	that one file they've misplaced. &quot;Can you resend it please?&quot;  \n	&quot;Sure, as soon as I get back to the office.&quot;  Too late, another \n	vendor stepped in. It's just that fast.\n</p></p><p><h2>Communication</h2>\n<p>	\n	Communication is quite distinct from accessibility. Being able to touch someone \n	electronically does no good without the context need to interpret those touches. \n	Once a fire starts to burn, it's the manager's responsibility to wield the extinguisher. \n	If you get a page or email of simply &quot;help, the client is unhappy,&quot; \n	you're powerless to do anything without situational context. Talking someone \n	through an issue cannot be replaced by a volley of emails or text messages, no \n	matter how neat the device is you're sending them with.\n</p></p><p><h2>Usability</h2>\n<p>	\n	Access and communication are useless if the technology deployed is counterintuitive \n	or counterproductive. Having managers carry twelve-pound-anythings means they won't \n	use them. Issuing devices with less than the necessary functionality are as useless \n	as those left in their cases. A small, functional, clear and always-on device will \n	be able to meet the accessible and communicative needs of today's fast-paced businesses.\n</p></p><p><h2>Return On Investment</h2>\n<p>	\n	Yes, I asked you to disregard money for a moment, but that's over. Welcome back.\n</p>\n<p>\n	The cost of implementing the technology necessary to fully equip your workforce, \n	even if only at the management level, must be recouped in a very real fashion. \n	There is no getting around the initial, and often very large, cost of this kind of \n	implementation. What a business is able to show as a result of the investment \n	is where the real value will be apparent. These results are often indirectly \n	proven: increased customer satisfaction, improved employee efficiency, faster \n	reaction times to issues, and a more efficient, more informed workforce. \n	These so-called 'soft dollars' may sound trivial, but you'll be hard-pressed \n	to argue against increasing customer satisfaction, employee efficiency, reaction \n	times, et cetera.\n</p></p><p><p>\n	Not every employee needs a $600 neat-o device in addition to their laptop/desktop \n	or whatever other technology issued to them. Those employees charged with managing \n	other employees, managing clients, or otherwise responsible for ensuring the business\n	 runs as efficiently as possible should have all of the tools necessary to make \n	 these goals a reality. Budget is also a clear factor, as not every business will \n	 be able to equip their force with the latest and greatest. In both cases, the onus \n	 falls on the business to research the available technology and determine which \n	 implementation best suits their needs and the needs of their clients, employees, \n	 and stakeholders.\n</p></p><p><p>\n	Even though the initial outlay for such a rollout usually requires a significant \n	amount of capital, remember the return on investment is measured in long term \n	productivity and efficiency. Businesses better able and more equipped to respond \n	to their customer's needs are going to beat their competitors to the punch every \n	single time. By taking advantage of the fusing of communication with available technology, \n	and properly leveraging that fusion, you'll stay right where you want to be: at \n	your customer's fingertips and first on their minds.\n</p>
