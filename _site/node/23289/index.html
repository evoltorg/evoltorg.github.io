<p>It seems that after 2 years of web dominance since <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="The little search engine that got big - opens in a new window">Google's</a> first appearance\nas a beta project at Stanford University, the lovable little blighter faces a \nchallenger.</p>\n<h3>Enter Teoma</h3>\n<p><A href="http://www.teoma.com" target="_blank" title="Teoma Search Engine - Opens in a New Window">Teoma</A>, currently in beta testing, \nhas already been supplying results to <A href="http://www.ask.co.uk/">AskJeeves</A> for a while now with a positive response. A spokesman for Teoma indicated that he was interested in taking\nTeoma down the independent route like Google and not just to use it as a backend search \nsupplying the 'big boys'.</p></p><p><h3>How it works</h3>\n<p>Teoma does not work quite like Google. Rather than using a "Page Rank" structure to\ndecide what is relevant, it collects together (in realtime) a set of all of the pages\non the web containing the relevant key words. Teoma then performs a 'community' analysis\non them, finding out how the pages link architectures relate to each other and decides their importance. After all, \nthe web does not operate on how many inward links you get, it operates on millions of interlinking related communities.</p></p><p><p><em>For example:</em> Lets say we search for "web development". Teoma finds all pages containing those keywords. Now, imagine that all of the pages have a link to <A href="http://www.evolt.org/" target="_blank" title="You're already here.">evolt.org</A>.\nThis suggests to Teoma that it is something of an authority in the world of "web development" and thus we get a high ranking.</p></p><p><p>Teoma also provides a nice folder system for categorising sub-groups of sites which are relevant to your search... so our search for "web development" may turf out sub-folders such as "backend" "web design" "tools" etc...</p></p><p><p>The lack of dependence on volume of links is also good news for honest coders since it means that the popular practice of google link spamming may become obsolete.</p>
