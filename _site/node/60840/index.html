          <h2>Keep The Puny Humans Happy Comrades</h2>
<p class="meta">15 Sep 2007</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Comrades, it has been several years since we've landed on this forsaken little blue and green planet, and I've come to realise that we've been going about dealing with these humans in the wrong way. We've had to deal with many uprisings, and I suspect, would not have to, if we can succeed in keeping them blissfully happy and ignorant, till that 'day'. It seems, my esteemed comrades, that we have strayed from the path of our primary initiative, that of gaining the trust of the humans, in order to later make it easier for ourselves to devour them. This is a simple goal, and yet, so difficult to grasp for many (And here I thought we were the superior beings).</p></p><p><p>In the light of my musings, I felt it my duty to write a decree of conduct for all involved in our little endeavour, especially those involved in the systematic takeover of their quaint little experiment of amusement, known as the world wide web, or internet, if you will. I might add that a couple of heads are already assigned for the chop block, so do run, as they say, but hiding will do you no good.</p></p><p><p>Let us 'kick off', as the english humans are particularly fond of saying, and start at the beginning.</p></p><p><h2>Remember, your designs are for puny humans</h2>\n<p>We all know that humans are of the less intelligent species in the universe, and it is through conventional repetition alone that most of them finally grasp an idea. Let us not forget that so it is on their little world wide web as well. Keep websites simple and fast, with a home page. All humans like to go home some or other time. Another alarming fact is that the humans cannot handle it when a website has a different look for each page. It is best, dear fellows, to keep navigation structure in the same place throughout a site, and to do the same with content and images.</p></p><p><h2>Use language correctly</h2>\n<p>If you're writing in their english, make sure it is english used on planet earth, and not the kind of english mixed with our superior utterances, that I've come across on their web, which by some misfortune (for the writer in question, that is) led many humans to be irritated by the content, making them leave to find comfort in content written by their own. Do not confuse these little animals. Remember, they still think that they have control over the planet, and so it is on their web as well. Last but not least, why mix english with our language, that most pure of uttered sounds? Sigh...</p></p><p><h2>Their vision is limited</h2>\n<p>Comrades, we've run the tests, we've seen the results. Humans do not have the abilities that we are born with naturally, especially in terms of sight. They see things very simply, very, flat, if you will. Do not, for the love of our ruler, create websites with dark text on dark backgrounds, or light text on light backgrounds. This, to you, may be perfectly fine, and make as much sense as breathing does to them, but they find it impossible to read, and thus causes frustration. Remember friends, we want them to be calm and happy.</p></p><p><h2>Use headings to inform</h2>\n<p>These humans are forever on the run, like the little rats they like to keep in cages. They like to think that their technology is far advanced, and that, if they stop running, their planet will stop turning. Friends, we should play this card very wisely. Make them run like little rats. Make it easy for them to devour information. Make it difficult for them to resist. I have found that headings serve this purpose most excellently.</p></p><p><h2>Their methods of communication are archaic</h2>\n<p>Altough the humans have stumbled upon information about 'telepathy', as they refer to it, leaked by our now beheaded minister of intergalactic communications, they certainly are clueless as to how it works, or what brain power is needed to use it. They cannot read each others' minds, friends. This rather sad little drawback has led them to invent certain rather peculiar forms of conveying information, like the strange little 'business card' that they carry around with them everywhere they go. Why do you think they need something like the 'world wide web', with all its little 'social networking' sites, in the first place? People, make sure you supply them with information. For our ruler's sake, at least make use of their ridiculous 'PHP', to create some sort of form, which they can use to contact each other with.</p></p><p><h2>Inform, inform, inform</h2>\n<p>For those humans who do not merely waste their precious little time on headings, make sure that there is enough meat to satisfy their appetites to the point of wanting more. Create what they call 'a vicious circle' of information. The more they get, the more they want. Remember friends, that this is good for 'search engines' as well. Unlike our search engines, these ones are manufactured, and ultimately maintained, by humans. therefore, it needs to be approached as a mere human too.</p></p><p><h2>Do not get carried away with their newest trends</h2>\n<p>Some of these humans are quite, 'sharp', shall we say? Every week producing a new little gadget. And from our studies, comrades, it is clear that the human suffers from the 'see it, must have it' syndrome, the type of sickness that led our sister planet to utter destruction. Do not catch on to this vile practise, friends. Leave it to the human 'web designers' to get carried away with such trickery. Use that which is necessary to keep the humans informed, and make sure their visits to websites are pleasant. Am I saying that all human inventions are useless? Not at all, friends. I must admit, with some degree of disgust, that these useless little creatures can come up with good ideas, albeit with great help from us. But these little animals do tend to go overboard sometimes, and we need to be cautious of this.</p></p><p><p>Comrades, I do hope that this paper will serve the greater purposes of our mission, and that all will fall in line with the decree. If not, suffer the wrath of our ruler, who does seem to suffer greatly from a permanent migraine these days, produced from interacting with these strange beings we so graciously endure.</p>
