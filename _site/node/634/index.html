<p>According to a recent <a href="http://www.metacreations.com/">MetaCreations</a> \n  press release, the company plans to divest itself of its 2D and 3D graphics \n  software, in order to pursue its e-commerce technology, &quot;MetaStream.&quot; \n  This is woeful news to many of us who have used some of the software MetaCreations \n  has both created and acquired, such as KPT, Bryce, Painter, Ray Dream Studio, \n  Poser, Infini-D, etc. There is no mention of what will become of the product \n  line.</p>\n<p>Apparently, MetaCreations &quot;no longer sees the professional graphics business \n  as offering growth as compared to its e-commerce visualization opportunities.&quot;</p>\n<p>Read the <a href="http://www.metacreations.com/press/restructure.shtml">press \n  release</a>.</p>\n
