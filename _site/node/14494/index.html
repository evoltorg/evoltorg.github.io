<h2>What it is</h2>\n<p>From the first time I heard of the Internet, my mind has focused in the way this medium is going to change people, and society.</p>\n<p>One day I was attending communication classes and the professor talked about Marshall McLuhan. He said that tools and media are extensions of our bodies, that the microscope and telescope were extensions of our eyes, the telephone extension of our ears... It made a lot of sense to me, but then he stated <q>electronic media are direct extensions of our nervous system</q>, I immediately thought about the Internet I had first heard abut it the year before, my first time online was the year after. What would it mean to a person to have his (her) nervous system connected to the whole world in such a way?... </p>\n<p>I took this same question for my thesis research about it in 1996, and I got to know some very interesting experiences, but since then, I started living the most amazing experience myself.</p>\n<p>Years later, I have become a worker of the web and have a full time job trying to design websites that offer their visitors a pleasant User Experience. I still want to know more about the way the web is affecting the people who have made it part of their lives. I now have come to call my old study subject <q>The User's META Experience.</q></p>\n<p>I'm just re-starting this project, I haven't collected new testimonies yet, if you have something to share, please <a href="http://members.evolt.org/mantruc/ume_questions.txt" title="Download Plain Text Questionnaire" target="_blank">do so</a>.</p>\n<h2>Are You Experienced?</h2>\n<p>Has this web changed your life, has it not?<br>\nWhat do you think about it?<br>\nTake  a copy of my cuestionnaire <a href="http://members.evolt.org/mantruc/ume_questions.txt" title="Download Plain Text Questionnaire" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>\n</body>
