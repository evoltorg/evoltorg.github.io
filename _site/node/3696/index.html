<p>The founder of MozillaZine, Chris Nelson, has posted a rant in which he lashes out at 'third party micro-managing' for harming the Mozilla effort.\n                                                 </p></p><p><p>In the column, entitled "<a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=1708" target="_new">Netscape Cannot Win</a>", Nelson criticises the likes of the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/" target="_new">Web Standards Project</a> (WaSP), O'Reilly's David Flanagan, and Tim O'Reilly himself.</p></p><p><p>The WaSP ran a campaign to force Netscape to delay release to accommodate the new rendering engine NGLayout, with much support from the web developer community.</p></p><p><p>Flanagan recently wrote <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/news/flanagan_1100.html" target="_new">an article</a> and started <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/cgi-bin/comments?action=redirect&category=news&id=flanagan_1100.html&htitle=Netscape%20Navigator%206.0%20to%20Fail%20Standards%20Compliance" target="_new">a petition</a> demanding the further delay of Netscape 6 until further bugs are fixed.</p></p><p><p>Nelson's post raises an interesting issue for web developers: whether it is better to unconditionally support full web standards compliance, or settle for the release of a browser that may be becoming increasingly irrelevant as time passes.</p></p><p><p>Nelson has vowed to stop posting Netscape news on his site. "This crap will no longer will find a home in MozillaZine," he writes. "However, I allow myself an exception to clobber the hell out of the WSP if they continue to act like pussies."</p>
