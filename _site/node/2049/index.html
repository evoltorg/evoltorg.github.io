          <h2>New Evolt Features</h2>
<p class="meta">31 May 2000</p>

<div class="post">
<P>\nAs some have already noticed, there are a couple new features on the evolt.org website that have popped up in the last couple weeks.\n</P>\n<P>\nThe first is the listing of the last five messages that have been posted to evolt's mailing list, <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/mailman/listinfo/thelist" target="_new">thelist</a>. Hopefully this will let some people that don't normally spend time reading thelist see whats going on in our popular discussion list about all things web..(Thanks to <a href="http://www.fuseware.com" target="_new">Chris Evans</a> for the NNTP service btw!)\n</P>\n<P>\nThe second is the ability to subscribe to thelist when you <a href="http://evolt.org/user/index.html?action=signup">create an evolt.org account</a>. We're trying to tie some functionality between our mailing list and website to provide some *really* cool features and interactivity, and this is step one.\n</P>\n<P>\nOf course, there is a major redesign underway for our web site. <b>Many, many</b> new and exciting features and improvements are underway by a group of evolt members that are volunteering their time to make this happen. (big thanks to all them as well :) Hopefully, we are ready to go live with it 'Real Soon Now' ;)\n</P>\n<P>\nIf <i>you</i> have any suggestions on cool features we could implement or ideas for anything evolt, feel free to tell us! Simply log in, and submit what you're thinking in the 'suggestions' center on the right. Remember, evolt is only as good as the people that contribute to it, so thanks for your ideas/support/comments/help! :)\n</P>
