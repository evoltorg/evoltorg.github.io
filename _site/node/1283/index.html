<b>&lt;advertising-puff&gt;</b>In a cynical attempt to snag some search engines and thereby drag a handful of people to see his insipid vacation snaps, etc., Peter Evans (that's me!) created yet another "All the browsers I could think of" page way back in February 1999. Thereafter, to his mild surprise, he found he was actually getting interested in it (particularly as an excuse for collecting pretty buttons and icons), and put a bit of effort into keeping it moderately up to date.</p><p>It's still no great shakes, but <a href="http://www.hoary.org/browse/" target="_new">Optimized for no one</a> is about as comprehensive and reliable as any of its alternatives, and is prettier than most.<b>&lt;/advertising-puff&gt;</b>
