          <h2>Happy 2nd Birthday Evolt</h2>
<p class="meta">14 Dec 2000</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Another year older, another year... wiser?</p>\n<p>\nWe've had an exciting year at evolt, and an exciting year in our industry.\nAs the dot com explosion starts to crumble in on itself and companies get\nripped apart faster than mice in a pirana tank, evolt remains steadfast on\nits course. Despite all the turmoil around us, we've kept true to that which\nevolt was based on: a "community for web developers, promoting the mutual\nfree exchange of ideas, skills and experiences."\n</p>\n<p>\nNow, that may not sound like much, if we hadn't done anything between last\nyear and this one we would've stayed the course also, right? But we haven't\nbeen standing still. We have more members on thelist and on the site than\nwe've ever had before. We've outgrown our old architecture, redesigned the\nsite, added a variety of new features and are continually getting closer to\na seamless integration between the mailing list (thelist) and the web site.\n</p>\n<p>\nNot a small task by any means. Sometimes I wonder if .djc and others really\nhave day jobs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd what is most important? Not only are people still adding articles and\nanswering questions, but the level of knowledge and depth of experience in\nthese responses continues to grow and expand every day. Perhaps I am biased\nbut I have yet to find a site that is anywhere near as helpful or as giving.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo, again, I say thank you to the evolt community and to all the people who\ntake the time to answer questions, build new features, or show support for\ntheir peers. You make the internet a better place to work.</p>
