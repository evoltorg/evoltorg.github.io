It's probably no surprise to those of us at the chalkface, but the demand for IT-aware people, and the money paid for them, is going through the roof, and will continue to do so. And now officially the <a href="http://www.ecommerce.gov/ede/chapter4.html" target="_new">US Government</a> agrees.<p> In a major study, <a href="http://www.ecommerce.gov/ede/" target="_new">The Emerging Digital Economy II</a>, employment growth in IT is growing half as fast again as the general US economy, and at $50k, average pay for Internet designers are around 66% over the national average. If you <b>really</b> want to know where the money is, it's in eCommerce, paying on average over $100k (nice work if you can get it).<p> Of course, to get the work, you need the education and skills. Wages are predicted to be directly linked to educational attainment and skill level, so that training course is worth the money! <P>
