          <h2>Css3   The New Frontier</h2>
<p class="meta">13 May 2004</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Imagine this: overnight, the <a href="http://www.w3.org"><abbr title="World Wide Consortium">W3C</abbr></a> makes <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets &#8212; Level 3">CSS3</abbr> a standard, and the browsers end their differences (<acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> included) and support everything in CSS3. How will this affect you? What magical things that CSS3 offers will bring your webpages to life? </p></p><p><p>For instance, CSS3 gives us cross&#8211;browser <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-color-20030214/#transparency">opacity</a>, standardized Image Replacement (via <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-ui-20030703/#additional"><code>display: icon</code></a>), and automatic <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-css3-border-20021107/#the-box-shadow">box</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/#text-shadows">text</a> shadows, not to mention being able to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-ui-20030703/#resize">control the resizing of a window through CSS</a>. And there&#8217;s a lot more where that came from.</p></p><p><p>But then you wake up and realize that complete cross&#8211;browser support for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets &#8212; Level 3">CSS3</abbr> was still at the very least 4 years away. But all hope is not lost &#8212; there are some bits of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets &#8212; Level 3">CSS3</abbr> already supported (and some supported by more than one browser).</p></p><p><h2>Current Support</h2>\n<p>\nI have done some research and set up a <a href="http://geocities.com/seanmhall2003/css3">CSS3 Tests Site</a> (which includes a <a href="http://geocities.com/seanmhall2003/css3/compat.html">compatibility table</a>). I have been very strict in making <strong>only</strong> CSS3 Tests, since I feel if I cross over to CSS2 I&#8217;ll get distracted. The only CSS2 property I have tested is <code>caption-side</code> (<a href="http://geocities.com/seanmhall2003/css3/table.html">Test page</a>). I really would love to test more CSS2 things, but I simply don&#8217;t have the time. If you want CSS2 (with some CSS1 and CSS3) tests visit Peter&#8211;Paul Koch&#8217;s wonderful <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/index.html?/css/contents.html">CSS2 Tests</a>.  I test in <strong>IE 6</strong>, <strong>Opera 7.50</strong>, <strong>Mozilla Firefox 0.8</strong>, <strong>Mozilla 1.7 RC 1</strong> and <strong>Safari 1.2</strong>. The latter has amazing CSS3 support. So what are the most widely supported bits of CSS3?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Attribute Selectors</strong> (^, $, *) &#8212; Supported by Mozilla and Safari</li>\n<li><strong>Opacity</strong> &#8212; Supported by Mozilla 1.7 RC 1 and Safari 1.2</li>\n<li><strong>box-sizing</strong> &#8212; Supported by Opera 7 and IE 5 Mac</li>\n<li><strong>:not</strong> &#8212; Supported by Mozilla and Safari</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Proprietary Support</h3>\n<p>Safari 1.2 is the only browser to support the <code>:selection</code> pseudo&#8211;class and <code>text-shadow</code>. Adequate <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets &#8212; Level 3">CSS3</abbr> support seems to be a major priority for the Safari Development team. Mozilla 1.7 RC 1 is the only browser to support the new <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/#selectors">~ selector</a> (first supported by 1.7 beta)<strong><a href="#ast">*</a></strong>.</p>\n<h2>When can I use this?</h2>\n<p>This is the bad part. IE 6 (which is roughly 90% of the browser market) supports <strong>none</strong> of CSS3, and Opera 7 is suprisingly behind. Sure, Opera 7 supports <code>list-style-type: box</code> and <code>box-sizing</code>, but where&#8217;s the support for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/#selectors">the new attribute selectors</a> or pseudo-classes? I think the Opera developers are more interested in improving Opera 7&#8217;s <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium Document Object Model">W3C DOM</abbr> support. Fair enough. IE7 on the other hand (no, not Dean Edward&#8217;s behaviour) is rumored to be released with the new OS around 2005 or 2006. </p>\n<h2>Just the beginning</h2>\n<p>Of course, research has only just begun. I still have loads more tests to make, more compatibility notes to take, more tables to create. The major problem is I only have access to Safari 1.2 once a week (also a long story). For Safari 1.2 users, feel free to comment if you know of some other CSS3 property that is supported by your wonderful browser.</p>\n<p>Try experimenting with <code>opacity</code> and some other new CSS3 properties. Don&#8217;t use them in practice (as only 2% of your users will see the effects), but give them a spin &#8212; think of it as a &#8220;sneak peek&#8221; of great things to come.</p>\n<a name="ast"></a>\n<p><strong>*</strong>: This selector is not supported by the first few builds of 1.7b. Later builds support it.</p>
