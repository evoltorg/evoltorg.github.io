<br /><strong>Why do you need to record the computer?</strong><br />\n"What’s wrong with my computer/this tool?” When you have problems of trying new applications or system, and have no idea of how to describe what happened on your computer, you may need a tool to mirror your operations, and then send it to a computer guru or technical support for help. It need to show exactly what you have done and how can this happen, so the technical staff can understand you clearly and give you the quick solution within minutes. It’s efficient for you to get the quick response.\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Do you really need a camera to record your computer screen?</strong> A camera face to your computer is not the best way for these purposes. First, the camera can not record the screen exactly. Second, you can not edit the video by adding some instructions or narrations. Third, the video file is too big for web sharing and transmission.\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Maybe you need an application to record your screen, not a camera!</strong> <a href="http://www.sameshow.com/demo-creator.html">Screen recorder tool</a> helps you to record the screen to mirror all of your operations without camera. You can add tips to highlight the important functions. Furthermore, you can add narration from microphone easily to enhance the demo. At last you can publish the flash movie and transmit to the technical guys. As you know, the flash format with smaller size and better for network transmission.\n<br /><br />\nIt’s very popular that these demo creator tools work with three steps, <strong>record screen, enhance with annotations and publish to movie</strong>. A good one in this area I want to highlight is <a href="http://www.sameshow.com/demo-creator.html">Wondershare DemoCreator</a>, with the excellent functions of Auto-annotation and click zone. It’s suitable for individual uses, no need of programming or media skills.\n<br /><br />\nEspecially, DemoCreator’s <strong>build-in ready-for-use after capture, adds the annotation and click zone to recorded screens automatically when recording is being done</strong>. After recording is completed, you can just publish the movie immediately. The actions of mouse movements and application operations are recorded automatically already. Audiences can know how to use your products step by step when playing the demo. Furthermore, you can add some animations or interactivities to enhance the software demo, thus making the demo more animated and interactive.\n<br /><br />\nLearn more from: <a href="http://www.sameshow.com/demo-creator.html">http://www.sameshow.com/demo-creator.html</a><br /><br />\nView samples from: <a href="http://www.sameshow.com/democreator/create-software-demo-samples.html">http://www.sameshow.com/democreator/create-software-demo-samples.html</a>
