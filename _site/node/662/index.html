<P>\nAs you may know, Verisign security certificates included in some older Netscape browser\nversions <a href="http://home.netscape.com/cms/certinfo.html?cp=hom12p3">will soon expire</a>. The ability of consumers with older browsers to have continued\nsmooth and safe online transaction experiences may be affected by the expiration of these\nVerisign certificates. Although consumers will be able to continue to make secure\ntransactions, they will see an expiration dialog box whenever they try to access secure\nsites.  Please note that this Verisign certificate expiration is a normal occurrence -\nsimilar to that of a driver's license, which periodically expires. \n</P>\n<P>\nThe purpose of this message is to: \n<UL>\n<LI>1.  Let you know which older versions of Netscape browsers include the expiring Verisign\ncertificates. \n<LI>2.  Provide information on easy options for your customers to upgrade their browser. \n<LI>3.
