          <h2>Aol Goes Free In The Uk</h2>
<p class="meta">24 Aug 1999</p>

<div class="post">
Following the success of free ISPs such as <a href='http://www.freeserve.net' title='FreeServe Home Page'>FreeServe</a>, AOL launches a free service in the UK today. <P>\nThe new service is to be branded Netscape Online, presumably to maintain revenues from existing AOL customers. However, Netscape Online - a joint venture with German publisher Bertelsmann - will charge no monthly fees. This is only possible in the UK market, where ISPs receive a share of the phone charges incurred during a user's connect time. <P>\nAOL expect the service to do well by strength of their existing brand - market leaders such as FreeServe and <a href='http://www.currantbun.com' title='currantbun HomePage'>currantbun.com</a> have traded on the strong UK brands of electrical retailer <a href='http://www.dixons.com/' title='Dixons home page'>Dixons</a>, and <a href='http://www.thesun.co.uk/' title='News International home page'>The Sun</a> newspaper respectively. Netscape Online is also expected to be differentiated from AOL's family and Compuserve's small business markets by targetting the <a href='http://www.loaded.co.uk/' title='Whoooarr!'>new lad</a> segment. Given the diversification of the Net from its original young male audience, the success of this stereotypical strategy remains to be seen.  <P>\nMore info at the <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/the_company_file/newsid_428000/428621.stm' title='Good Old BBC'>BBC</a>.
