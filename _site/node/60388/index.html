          <h2>Seeking Intelligence Online Competitive Research</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Finding online information\nabout your competitors is easy - the difficult part is finding meaning.\nWhen researching the competition, you can avoid pitfalls by seeking\n'intelligence' instead of 'information'.</p>\n<p>The difference between\n'information' and 'intelligence' is twofold: purpose and process.\nHaving a purpose and a process for gathering information ensures that\nthe results will be useful - instead of merely informative.</p>\n<p>A well-defined purpose allows\nyou to search the Internet broadly and deeply without drowning\nin a flood of marginal information.</p>\n<p>The process for gathering good\ncompetitive intelligence is straightforward: identify industry/market\ntrends and competitors; define your questions; find the answers;\nanalyze the results; and act on them.</p>\n<p>The process begins with a wide\nsearch of the Internet to define trends in your industry/market and\ncompetitors. </p>\n<p>Useful\nresources include search engines, newspapers, business journals, and\ntrade press and online newsletters. Consider resources such as <a\n title="opens in a new window" href="http://www.newsisfree.com"\n target="popup">NewsIsFree</a>\nand other topical news 'clipping' sites. <a\n href="http://www.prnewswire.com" title="opens in a new window"\n target="popup">PR\nNewswire</a> and <a href="http://www.businesswire.com"\n title="opens in a new window" target="popup">Business\nWire</a> can be useful sources for\nnews releases and competitive <abbr title="public relations">PR</abbr>.</p>\n<p>Beginning with a broad\nindustry/market search decreases the likelihood that you'll overlook\npotential competitors and non-competing businesses in the industry that\nmay pose as sources of benchmarking, market insight and inspiration. </p>\n<p>Once you've identified trends\nand competitors, you can identify the questions you want to answer\nabout your competitors. Finding competitors' identities, pricing,\nplans, strengths, weaknesses, suppliers and customers play a very\nimportant part in formulating an effective business strategy. </p>\n<p>Finding answers often begin at\na competitor's own web site. When visiting competitors' web sites look\nbeyond product/service information. You can also learn by viewing a\ncompetitor's employment opportunities, organization chart, supplier and\nvendor lists, and press releases. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Explore\ntheir news/press area.\nOften, you can download their press kit or add your personal email\naddress to their email subscription list. </li>\n  <li>Search engines make it easy\nto\nfind PowerPoint presentations, speeches and white papers. Use search\nterms such as <abbr title="Microsoft PowerPoint Document">.ppt</abbr>,\n    <abbr title="Microsoft Word Document">.doc</abbr>\nand <abbr title="Adobe Portable Document Format">.pdf</abbr></li>\n  <li>Topics such as Investor\nRelations often include annual reports (even for private companies).</li>\n  <li>Forms that ask "How did you\nhear about us?" provide a list of locations where the company is\nspending marketing dollars.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After you've explored a\ncompetitor's web site, use other web sites to learn about their\norganization. Conduct keyword searches on search engines, public\nrecords sites, discussion groups and blogs.</p>\n<p>Notable\nsites:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href="http://www.archive.org" target="popup"\n title="opens in a new window">WayBack\nMachine</a> <br>\nAn Internet archive. Use this site to see historical versions of the\ncompany's web site. It will help determine changes in branding and\nofferings.</li>\n  <li><a href="http://www.fuckedcompany.com" target="popup"\n title="opens in a new window">F***edCompany.com</a><br>\nA site featuring company rumors and internal memos.</li>\n  <li><a href="http://www.alexa.com" target="popup"\n title="opens in a new window">Alexa</a><br>\nObtain traffic information about the traffic ranking, page views, and\nreach of a competitor's web site.</li>\n  <li><a href="http://www.uspto.gov" target="popup"\n title="opens in a new window">US\nPatent &amp; Trademark Office</a> <br>\nConduct a basic patent search on competitors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These\nrepresent only a handful\nof sites that are useful for gathering competitive intelligence. Based\non your industry, competitors, questions and creativity, it is possible\nto find a wide selection of useful online/offline resources. </p>\n<p>According to the <a href="http://www.scip.org" target="popup"\n title="opens in a new window">Society\nof Competitive Intelligence Professionals</a>,\nmore than 95% of information that is required for gathering competitive\nintelligence is publicly available from open sources.\n</p>
