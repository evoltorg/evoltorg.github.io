<div class="post">
<p>Greetings and let me be the first to welcome you to evolt.org 2.0! </p>\n<p>In conjunction with the second anniversary of evolt.org, we're proud to announce our completely redesigned website. Along with an updated look and feel, we've added - and are in the process of adding - a lot of new features for evolt.org visitors to improve accessibility, usability, HTML/CSS correctness, and overall sexiness. </p>\n<p>We started out our website on the NT platform with Coldfusion 3.0 and MS Access as our database on a single T-1 line two years ago. As you see us today, we're running on a state of the art home grown content management system that runs on Linux, Apache, Coldfusion 4.5, and Oracle 8i to provide our ever increasing audience with the fastest, most reliable, accessible, and standards compliant website devoted to the Web Development industry you'll find anywhere on the Web! </p>\n<p>We'll have some commentary during our birthday celebration from evolt.org members as they reflect and pontificate on the impact a group of Web Developers working for the common interest has had on their personal and professional lives. We'll also have tutorials and how-to's from the volunteers that built evolt.org 2.0. We'll share problems, techniques, and solutions that we encountered along the way to building evolt.org 2.0 with you, our fellow Web Developers... stay tuned!</p>\n<p>There will be plenty more to come as our 2.0 celebration rolls on, but I'd like to take this initial opportunity to thank all the people that helped make it happen: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Rudy Limeback - Resident Database Expert, Massager of Data </li>\n  <li>Jeff Howden - Oregon's(and evolt's) #1 Cold Fusion Expert </li>\n  <li>Adrian Roselli - Keeper of HTML/CSS Compliance </li>\n  <li>Isaac Forman - Original Layout and Design </li>\n  <li>Seth Bienek - Master of New & Improved Features </li>\n  <li>David McCreath - We wouldn't have gone live for another month if it weren't for his hard work and dedication</li>\n  <li>Elfur Logadottir - Huge amounts of work on our HTML/CSS compliance</li>\n  <li>Marlene Bruce - General Managment and keeping us scatter-brained coders on-task :) </li>\n  <li>Walker Fenton - Laying the foundation with evolt 1.0 </li>\n  <li>Dean Mah, Matt Warden, Joshua Olson, Scott Dexter, Matthew Haughey, Javier Velasco, and Martin Burns for all the testing, bug fixes, coding, and things we'll never fully realize or appreciate </li>\n  <li>Jennifer Miller - (awwww...) Not many girlfriends would put up with a person like myself who spends way to many hours doing projects like evolt for free. She not only puts up with my constant blabbering about evolt, but houses complete strangers when they come for a weekend to work with me on evolt 2.0 (codefest!).  Thanks Jen :) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, welcome to evolt.org 2.0. We hope you like what you see now, and what you'll come to see in the weeks ahead! Thousands of hours of collective volunteer time has gone into making evolt.org a better experience for you the Web Developer... We hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>.djc. </p>
