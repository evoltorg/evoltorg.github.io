Is there really anything more satisfying than baking from home for profit? Making delectable, delicious baked goods, chocolate tortes, cookies so sweet they bring back memories of happier days? If you ask Lilian Chavira she will tell you this is a dream come true.  A culinary artisan who makes food come to life. Recently I asked Lilian to share her story about how she started a home-based bakery in Okemos, Michigan. </p><p>Inheriting her creative gifts from her parents, both excellent cooks she started baking desserts as a young girl. She insists at the times, baking was more of a game and a way escape her shy demeanor and express her creativeness.</p><p>Lilian did not start decorating cakes with frosting until 3 years ago; she started first by decorating birthday cakes for her children, took a “Wilton Cake Decorating course” which laid the foundation and soon realized she really LOVED to decorate cakes. </p><p>Today, Gellocake is giving her the opportunity to improve her skills all while growing her business and meeting new daily challenges. The name Gellocake was created in 2004, when the company that her husband worked for transferred him from Mexico/El Paso, Texas to Okemos, MI. She resigned her job as a graphic designer in the Marketing department of an American-Swedish company; to become a stay-at-home; but she yearned to be creative and keep alive the memories and skills she learned while growing up.</p><p>Keeping in tune with most traditionalists, Lilian has foregone the use of “shortening” in her frosting due to its greasiness for good old fashioned butter and cream cheese.  She insists the cream cheese is actually a favorite request by her customers. Lilian continued to make gelatins and cakes for playgroups, church’s pot-lucks and as gifts for teachers and neighbors. She also enjoyed every opportunity to bake and design for those who were special friends.\n \nOne day the dream to have a home-based bakery became a constant prayer and she decided to put it in God’s hands and was prepared to do whatever it would take to make owning a home-based bakery a reality.\n \nAccording to Lilian it was a “HUGE CHALLENGE!” She contacted the Michigan Small Business Technology Center and the Chamber of Commerce and discovered that in Michigan, you needed to have a different space to make baked goods. You cannot use your home kitchen. One option was to rent a licensed commercial kitchen in a church or restaurant; a possibility, but not what Lilian wanted to do. This baker had young kids, and her husband traveled a lot; plus her gelatin desserts required a lot of preparation time. \nLilian saved money thinking that her basement was a possibility. She contacted the Department of Agriculture and asked an inspector to visit her home and talk about the possibilities. One of the requirements was to have a separate entrance because for business' inspections they can come any time and should not see your personal living quarters. The whole ordeal involved drumming over creative ways to address the various government agency requirements.\n \nLilian received rejection after rejection but did not give up; the oven type, window size, the height of the ceiling and a 3 compartment sink to sterilize equipment were huge challenges. Her house had a "parade" of inspectors from different agencies (Township, State and Health department) all of them giving her their own individual requirements. </p><p>The bright side of the experience was when Lilian found what she likes to call "angels," beautiful people willing to listen and work with her. She also employed a great contractor who did his best to meet all the different rules. The entire process took 7 months, and she had to spend four times the original budget but every time it looked impossible, Lilian insisted prayer saw her through. There were times when she wanted to just give up; forget about the bakery and continue her great life as a home-stay mom but the next morning she was thinking again how to make it work. It was at that point she knew she was born to this... she needed to do it… but her children would always be her number one priority.</p><p>Lilian said the secret to her success was that she always faced the process with a SMILE staying as professional as possible. She had a business plan, budget, pictures, drawings, different options, everything ready to show as needed in every meeting. Everyone began to realize she was determined to do it right and legal.  \n \n Lilian came up with the business name, ‘Gellocake’ by combining two different signature desserts – gelatins and cakes. With the name in place, she became inspired to jump over every hurdle that presented itself. Lilian insists “it took me almost eight months of planning, and getting all the permits from the different governmental entities to build my new separate industrial kitchen. It was not an easy process but I am so thankful to the State of Michigan for making it possible! My reward was seeing “Gellocake - Gourmet Gelatins & Cakes” became a reality.”</p><p>So the next time you think you just can’t go any further or you want to operate a home-based food processing business but it just appears too “hard.” Remember you have to have the “Gellocake” like persistence and you’ll make it happen.\n
