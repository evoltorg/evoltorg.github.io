          <h2>Microsoft Implementing Smart Tags In Ie Release</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>A recent article on the Wall Street Journal site might be a preview of the Microsoft features still to arrive in our browsers. Dubbed &quot;Internet Explorer Smart Tags&quot;, they could reignite the Third Voice-style debate from the past.</p></p><p><p>Smart Tags, like the infamous Third Voice plugin, result in your audience seeing your site in a manner not intended by you. Imagine your site littered with links (to Microsoft, and Microsoft-preferred sites) taking your visitors away. Not many people would be too happy with that. Let's try that again: Would <strong>anyone</strong> be happy with that?</p></p><p><p>Microsoft is making assurances that Smart Tags will be disabled by default, and that site owners will be able to &quot;block&quot; them from effecting their audience with a simple meta tag, but shouldn't this process be reversed? Shouldn't site owners place a meta tag if they <strong>want</strong> Smart Tags to impact them?</p></p><p><p>One reason behind the offering (and you can bet that it isn't the primary goal!), according to Microsoft, is that it will help &quot;under-linked&quot; sites. Some sites might be under-linked for a reason, or they might purposefully place their links in a sidebar or footer to avoid cluttering the content area. Additionally, under-linked content areas are hardly a bad thing � content full of distracting links can impede reading. Some content, like <a href="http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/" title="Try to read one of those articles without mousing over each link to work out the point..." target="_blank">JWZ's grouchy pages</a>, hardly need any more links� ;)</p></p><p><p>It's a smart play by Microsoft. Many older sites and unaware developers won't place the Smart Tag blocking meta tag, and subsequently become littered with Microsoft-happy links, substantially raising the number of visits to their web properties. Also, it is possible that many re-branded ISP-releases of Internet Explorer could come with this feature enabled by default.</p></p><p><p>Smart and helpful for Microsoft perhaps, but I can hardly imagine the web development community being too pleased with the introduction of this feature.</p></p><p><p>Read the <a href="http://public.wsj.com/sn/y/SB991862595554629527.html" title="Offsite link to the Wall Street Journal" target="_blank">full WSJ article</a> and see what you think.</p></p><p><p>Would this help any of your sites at all? Would it help you as a user of the web?
