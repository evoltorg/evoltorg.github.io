Why four from just two blogging packages? Here is the answer to that question, and how if you create a blog using each, you will maximize your earning potential from your products:<br>\n<br>\nBlogger<br>\n<br>\nBlogger is blogging software owned by Google. Most people run their blog from BlogSpot, Bloggers blogging fast domain.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, where Word presses scores over Blogger is in the fact that the software can be uploaded to your website, and can be run from there. For more resources visit us at www.building-blog-empire.com. This enables you to use any of the thousands of Word press plugging and templates that provide an almost unlimited degree of functionality in your blogging that will help to drive traffic to your website.<br>\n<br>\nWhen you create a blog with any of these two different packages, whether run from your own computer or from the blog host, you are able to provide fresh content daily to your virtual website. Because that is what a blog is: it is in effect a web page, in the same way that a Squid lens and a page on a website is a web page.<br>\n<br>\nBogging and Search Engines<br>\n<br>\nBlogging allows you a presence on search engines such as Google and Yahoo, and allows those with little idea of SEO or even of web design, to sell products online. There was a time when blogs were a rarity and something new, but blogging is now a way for anybody that knows how to create a blog can drive traffic to their website or to their blog page and help they make money through free advertising.<br>\n<br>\nHowever, even a blog has to be advertised. Blogging in itself is not an advertising technique, but one of displaying your thoughts, idea, products or advertising your products. Now, you might think I am being a bit duplicitous here, stating that blogging is not a means of advertising yet can be used to advertise! Yet both statements are true.<br>\n<br>\nIs Blogging an Advertising Technique?<br>\n<br>\nYes and no. You can create a blog in order to get traffic to your website, and in that respect you are using your blog for advertising. You can place a link to your website: your squeeze page, sales page or just a content page. The question is, how do you get people to read your blog, and then click on one of these links? The link could be placed at the bottom of every post, and on a permanent page on your blog, but how do yet get traffic to your blog: you have the same problem now as getting traffic to your website!<br>\n<br>\nWhat you have here is that blogging can be use to promote another site, whether it be a website, another blog or a social networking site such as Face book, MySpace or YouTube. You can use all of these to promote and sell products. You can also visit us at www.your-own-blog.com. However, how do you get people, to find your blog? Creating a blog is fine, but that is only the start.<br>\n<br>\nUse Article Marketing in Blogging<br>\n<br>\nThere is one way, and that is article marketing. By writing articles about your niche or product, and then including a link to your blog in the article, you can use the article to advertise your blog. If you can persuade a reader to click on your link, they will reach your blog on which you provide them with links to your website, your other blogs and your Face book and MySpace home pages.<br>\n<br>\nFor more useful tips & hints, please browse for more information at our website:                                                \n<a href="http://www.greatblogbox.com" target="_blank">www.greatblogbox.com</a>,\n<a href="http://www.blogers-guide-to-profit.com" target="_blank">www.blogers-guide-to-profit.com</a>
