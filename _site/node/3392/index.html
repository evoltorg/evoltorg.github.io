<p>\nI, for one, will never forget the day a certain <a href="http://www.mindcraft.com/whitepapers/first-nts4rhlinux.html" target="_new">benchmark report from\nMindcraft</a> surfaced about a year and a half ago. It showed my beloved Linux\ngetting smashed by Windows NT in file and web serving benchmarks. A lot of things\ncame out of those benchmarks - accusations of cheating, more benchmarks, and finger\npointing to name a few - but a year and a half later, an answer to those benchmarks has arrived.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis summer the <a href="http://www.spec.org/osg/web99/results/res2000q2/" target="_new">SPECweb99 results</a> were published and out of nowhere, a Linux \nwebserver was now *creaming* its Windows 2000 counterpart. This for the most part caught\nthe Linux community(myself included) way off-guard. A year later, we had completely\nturned the tables on the Microsoft offering, now beating them at their own benchmarking game. What was even more of a shock was that the webserver that turned in the incredible results wasn't our tried and\ntrue <a href="http://www.apache.org/httpd" target="_new">Apache</a> webserver, but\na newcomer called Tux.\n</p>\n<p>\nTux is mostly the work of Ingo Molnar from RedHat. TUX is a kernel-based, threaded, extremely high performance HTTP server. It is able to efficiently and safely serve both static and dynamic data. It is a new breed of webserver that is very closely integrated with the new Linux kernel(2.4). This close integration between OS and webserver(as IIS has shown) leads to increased performance. You can read more about the hardcore details of Tux and how it uses integration with the Linux kernel to \nachieve such high levels of performance in <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/00/07/20/1440204.shtml" target="_new">this interview with Tux's author</a> on Slashdot.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince the SPECweb99 results this summer, many people have been eagerly awaiting a quality release version of TUX to \ntest, tune, and try on their own high traffic webservers. Today, the first binary release of TUX is available for\nall to download, try, and use. You can download it from <a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/tux/tux-1.0/" target="_new">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/tux/tux-1.0/</a> and try it on your Red Hat 6.2 or 7.0 systems now. Support\nfor other distributions is sure to follow.\n</p>\n
