          <h2>One Browser Many Names</h2>
<p class="meta">09 Jun 2002</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Now that the world has been enriched by both <strong>Netscape 7 Preview Release</strong> and\n<strong>Mozilla 1.0 Final</strong>,\nmany people have lost track of all Netzilla/Moscape releases.\nThe naming and versioning system (if any) is completely\nincomprehensible and becomes stranger with each new name and release. Personally\nI feel that this confusion is a deliberate policy of both the\n<a href="http://www.mozilla.org"\n	target="_blank">Mozilla project</a> and\n<a href="http://home.netscape.com/company/?cp=hop08fc7" target="_blank"\n	title="NCC corporate info">Netscape Communications Corporation</a>,\nsince both are very consistent in their inconsistency.</p></p><p><p>So it's time for an overview. What are the names of the various tries to produce a viable Netscape\nbrowser? Do these names mean anything?</p></p><p><h2>Netscape 5</h2></p><p><p>In 1998, Netscape released the source code of its (then still popular) Netscape 4 browser. The goal\nwas to make the production of the new Netscape 5 browser an open source project, involving thousands\nof programmers from all over the world.</p></p><p><p>Pretty soon, the\nproject decided to start all over again: the old Netscape 4 code engine was too complex and couldn't form\na stable basis for a new Netscape release (in fact, it didn't form a stable basis for Netscape 4\neither).</p></p><p><p>So a new browser would be written.\nEventually this brave new browser would become <b>Netscape 5</b>. So far so good.</p></p><p><h2>Mozilla</h2></p><p><p>From the earliest days of the Netscape browser, the code engine that actually took care of interpreting\nHTML, (later) JavaScript and (still later) CSS was called <b>Mozilla</b>. This strange name started out\nas a combination of <em>Mo</em>saic and God<em>zilla</em>. The message was supposed to be that this\nnew code engine would sweep  goold old Mosaic away, as Godzilla swept away King Kong. Something like\nthat, anyway.</p></p><p><p>Netscape 1 ran Mozilla 1, 2 ran 2, 3 ran 3 and Netscape 4 ran Mozilla 4. Remember that back in those\ndays a new version number actually meant something: each new Netscape version could do far more than\nits predecessor.</p></p><p><p>Almost every browser identification string still starts with the name <em>Mozilla</em>,\neven those of non-Netscape browsers. The reasons behind this are\n<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~ppk/js/index.html?detect.html#string"\n	target="_blank" title="An explanation of the use of the name 'Mozilla' in non-Netscape browsers."\n	>another story</a>.</p></p><p><p>When the project to write a new Netscape code engine started, it was named\n<a href="http://www.mozilla.org"\n	target="_blank">The Mozilla Project</a>. One would expect the goal of this project was to\nproduce <strong>Mozilla 5</strong>, being the fifth version of the Netscape code engine.</p></p><p><h2>Gecko</h2></p><p><p>Not so. In the beginning each code engine release was named <b>Gecko</b> for reasons I've\nforgotten. (Well, a gecko is a lizard and a godzilla is, too, so there might be some obscure point in giving it\nthis name.) To this name was added an <strong>M</strong> for <em>Milestone</em> and a version number. So the Mozilla\nproject delivered Gecko M1, then Gecko M2 and so on.</p></p><p><p>From the very earliest releases, the browser identification string started with <em>Mozilla/5.0</em>,\nindicating that the browser would eventually become Netscape 5.</p></p><p><p>So eventually Mozilla 5 would form the core of Netscape 5, and until that time web developers would\nbe entertained by the various Gecko releases, numbering their Milestones from 1 onwards\nuntil the Nirvana of standards-compatible browsing would be reached.\nSo far so good (well, OK-ish).</p></p><p><h2>Netscape 6</h2></p><p><p>Not so. The project took too bloody long. Microsoft had had a working Version 5 browser\nalmost since the start of the Mozilla project, which would mean that the new Netscape 5 would be seen\nas a laggard, appearing on the scene while Microsoft already prepared its Version 6 browser.</p></p><p><p>So, unbeknownst to us web developers, marketing geniuses inside Netscape (or its corporate owner\nAOL) decided the new Netscape would be Version 6. So when, on 14 November 2000, a preview\nbased on Gecko M18 was released, it was proudly named <b>Netscape 6.0 Preview Release</b>. So Netscape\nhas <em>altogether skipped Version 5</em>.</p></p><p><p>Nonetheless the browser identification string still proclaimed it to be <em>Mozilla/5.0</em>,\nin keeping with the old Netscape tradition. So technically it was a Version  5 browser, marketing-wise\nit was a Version 6 browser.</p></p><p><p>Keeping track of the names started to get confusing, but it could be managed.</p></p><p><h2>Mozilla 1.0</h2></p><p><p>Therefore the Mozilla Project decided the situation wasn't vague enough. When Netscape 6.0, based\non Gecko M18, had been released, the Gecko name was altogether dropped. Instead, the new goal of the\nproject became the production of <strong>Mozilla 1.0</strong>.</p></p><p><p>One wonders why the new code engine wasn't named <strong>Mozilla 5.0</strong>, the only name that actually\nmakes sense: the fifth version of the Mozilla code engine.</p></p><p><p>But the Mozilla Project was not to be denied.\nIn quick succession Mozilla 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.8.1, 0.9, 0.9.1, 0.9.7, 0.9.8, and 0.9.9 were released.\nThe Project was working towards 1.0, no doubt about it.</p></p><p><p>Then, when everyone expected Mozilla 1.0, the Project came with a new subtlety: Release Candidates.\nMozilla 1.0 Release Candidate 1, Mozilla 1.0 RC 2 and Mozilla 1.0 RC 3 were released. Personally I'd\nexpected even more confusion, culminating in something like Mozilla 1.0 Release Candidate 2.1 beta 3,\nbut the Project has unexpectedly become sensible and given us <strong>Mozilla 1.0 Final</strong>.</p></p><p><h2>Mozilla 1.0.3 Preliminary Review 3.5a ?</h2></p><p><p>This latest release in fact seems to be a pretty good browser (though I've only done some preliminary\ntests). So the Mozilla Project has done what it has promised so many years ago. Cause for celebration,\ncertainly, but personally I don't feel like it at all: I'm too confused.</p></p><p><p>The Project has already announced Mozilla 1.1, which makes sense, but I'm afraid we'll have to\ndeal with Mozilla 1.0.3 Preliminary Review 3.5a and such arcana first. Then again, I might be wrong\n(in fact, I hope I'm wrong).</p></p><p><p>Of course the browser identification string still starts with <em>Mozilla/5.0</em>, and not <em>Mozilla/1.0</em>,\nwhich would cause people to confuse it with ancient Netscape 1. To make it even more complex, <em>Gecko</em>\nis also mentioned in the string. I don't know what all this means. Just nod wisely and pretend it's completely\nlogical.</p></p><p><h2>Netscape 7</h2></p><p><p>So from Mozilla 0.6 onwards it was clear where the Mozilla Project was heading. Therefore fresh\nconfusion initiatives had to come from Netscape, or rather from its corporate owner AOL.</p></p><p><p>It succeeded admirably. The latest Netscape release is not Netscape 6.3 but <strong>Netscape 7.0\nPreview Release</strong>. So the browser version number has once again been raised. Why?</p></p><p><p>Rumour has it that AOL is considering the use of the Netscape browser in its newest AOL 7. This\nrumour may be true, it may also be another ritual move in the eternal dance of Microsoft and AOL, a\nthreat that might cause Microsoft to make some concessions. No way to tell. Fact is that AOL subsidiary\nCompuserve does use a modern Netscape as its browser (I forgot which version exactly).</p></p><p><p>In any case, to make sure its users understand what's going on, AOL has decided on the combination\nAOL 7-Netscape 7. Not the worst of ideas, from a corporate point of view. The suffering of web developers\ntrying to keep track of the various versions is less important, of course.</p></p><p><h2>What's next?</h2></p><p><p>I have no idea what will come next. I'm reasonably sure a browser named <b>Netscape 7</b>, based on\nthe <strong>Mozilla 1.0</strong> code engine will be released fairly soon. This will be a Version 5 browser\n(hence <em>Mozilla/5.0</em> in its identification string).\nIt might even be that AOL will start using this browser in its own setup.</p></p><p><p>As you see version numbers have become completely void of all meaning. Where, up until Explorer 5,\nyou could be reasonably sure a new version number meant the support of exciting new technologies,\nnowadays it means no such thing.</p></p><p><p>The past cause of events has shown both Netscape and the Mozilla project are completely unreliable and\nunpredictable in the assignment of names and version numbers. So the situation will continue to be confusing\nand I suppose I'll write an addendum to this article in half a year.</p>
