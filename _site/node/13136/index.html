<p>\nOur good friends at <a href="http://www.proximaconsulting.com/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Proxima Consulting</a>\nseem to have problems deciding what to put on their site. Poor lambs.\n</p>\n<p>\nThey also seem to have had problems with coming up with an effective\nuser experience.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo, in the best tradition of dumb people everywhere, they stole it. All.\nWords, images, layout, sitemap down to a URL level. Everything.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhich would have been fine (in a 'not' sense) except that they stole\nit from one of the better UK CED and SI agencies, <a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Oyster</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n...who found it when one of their staff was doing some research last weekend. The\nonly changes Proxima had made seems to have been a crude\nsearch and replace on the Oyster name, even claiming that Proxima\nhad merged with companies who had in fact merged with Oyster.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince being called on it, Proxima have pulled the entire site beyond\nthe Flash intro. So skipping the intro means you also skip the entire\nsite. Nice.\n</p>\n<p>\nFortunately, <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Google</a> has a cached copy. Here are a couple of samples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:i5kSpVYB0hU:www.proximaconsulting.com/jobs/commitment.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Proxima's jobs page</a>\nand\n<a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/jobs/commitment.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Oyster's job page.\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/oyster/history.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Oyster's history</a> (note the KBW merger info) and\n<a href="http://www.oyster.co.uk/oyster/angle.html\n" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">approach</a> -v-\n<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:fyF_JOctSOs:www.proximaconsulting.com/proxima/angle.html+proxima+consulting+KBW" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Proxima's approach</a> (who say that <em>they</em> merged with KBW).\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oyster took a copy of the offending site and contacted Proxima, which may explain the Proxima site disappearance. I hear that Oyster aren't going to sue... at the moment</p>\n<p>Can you imagine being the person responsible, and the meeting held at Proxima to consider his or her future... Are they selling tickets?</p>
