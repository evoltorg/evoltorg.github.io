          <h2>Apache 1 3 14 Released</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Oct 2000</p>

<div class="post">
<p>The <a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_new">Apache Group</a> is pleased to announce the release of the 1.3.14 version of the Apache HTTP\nserver. The main improvements in this release are to fix security vulnerabilities in the\nmod_vhost_alias and mod_rewrite modules. Apache 1.3.14 is the best version of Apache currently\navailable; everyone running 1.2.X servers or earlier should upgrade to 1.3, as there will not be any\nfurther 1.2.X releases. At present, the Win32 port of Apache is not as stable as the UNIX version.\nThe Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are pleased to announce the\nrelease of version 1.3.14 of the Apache HTTP server. Version 1.3.13 was never released.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis version of Apache is primarily a security fix and bug fix release, but there are a few new\nfeatures and improvements. A summary of the new features is given at the end of this document.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe consider Apache 1.3.14 to be the best version of Apache available and we strongly recommend\nthat users of older versions, especially of the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible. No\nfurther releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.\n</p>\n<p>\nApache 1.3.14 is available for download from</p><p><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/dist/" target="_new">http://httpd.apache.org/dist/</a>.\n</p>\n
