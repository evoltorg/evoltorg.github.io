          <h2>Coldfusion 5 0 Released</h2>
<p class="meta">29 May 2001</p>

<div class="post">
ColdFusion 5.0 has been released by Macromedia. Some of the new features include:\n<OL>\n<LI>User defined functions\n<LI>Charting (simple, but nice)\n<LI>CFDUMP, the coder's best friend. This used to be in Spectra only, but now it's in the server proper. Not one day goes by where I don't use this tag.\n<LI>Query of Queries\n<LI>Flushed output\n<LI>Server reporting enhancements\n<LI>Server archiving. This is a <I>really</I> cool feature where you can backup both code and server settings into a simple file that can be deployed to new machines. This makes working in a cluster much easier.\n<LI>Server probes. A cool way to check the health of your system and perform actions when things go to heck.\n</OL></p><p>There is a lot more, so I suggest you check <A HREF="http://www.allaire.com" TARGET="new">Allaire.com</A> for more information.</p><p>In general, this is a cool release both on the code side, as well as the management side. In fact, I think it's a much bigger release for how it aids and supports the management of web apps.
