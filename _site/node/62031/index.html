          <h2>Understanding The Different Types Of Web Hosting Packages</h2>

<p>The reason we have a usable Internet at all is  because there are companies called hosting providers that give websites their  virtual "homes" in cyberspace. There are many kinds of hosting services and  solutions, with enough flexibility among them for webmasters to customize  approaches for their specific needs. Despite this wide range of capabilities,  however, hosting providers still offer three common package types - shared  hosting, virtual hosting and dedicated hosting - although today leading hosting  firms will also offer more personalized packages, often referred to as managed  and semi-managed plans.</p>\n<p>Understanding the differences among these approaches  is just as important as comparing security, service, expertise and cost among  the various providers you will consider. Understanding the different types of  web hosting packages, in fact, can help you narrow the field of companies from  which you will eventually pick a winner. This article will educate you  sufficiently (although more study is always better than less) to choose the  right hosting package, and perhaps even the right company to implement it for  you.</p>\n<p>Shared hosting</p>\n<p>Companies and individuals making their first foray  into the World Wide Web often sign up for the least expensive groups of plans,  which would be under the "shared hosting" category. As the name clearly  indicates, your website will be "sharing" disk space on a server with 20 or 200  other sites. Part of your agreement includes a commitment to stay within a  certain, prescribed percentage of the server's CPU (Central Processing Unit)  usage. For family sites, small companies and other limited "rollouts," this is  usually not a problem.</p>\n<p>In fact, shared hosting schemes were originally designed  around certain assumptions about site owners&rsquo; behavior, many of which turned  out to be right on the money. One of the many assumptions that has since become  fact is that customers simply do not use all the bandwidth (storage) that  they've been allotted in their paid plan. The fact is, many people and firms  run small websites whose traffic volume only requires a small fraction of that  bandwidth. Every so often, a small site will experience a sudden surge of  traffic and data transfers, pushing the website use over the set limit. You  will want to plan ahead for this kind of eventuality, as most agreement will  give your hosting provider the right to "freeze or seize" the website, at least  temporarily.</p>\n<p>Virtual private hosting</p>\n<p>As opposed to the shared hosting plans, a Virtual  Private Server (VPS) will set you up with a Virtual Dedicated Server (VDS). You  will still share server space with other sites, but will have your own  environment, or partition, on that server. Individual servers are often divided  into multiple, discrete (separate) partitions that run their own OS (Operating  System) and can be booted up individually. These can be very important features  for many firms. Of course, you will still share space on a single physical  server, be restricted to a certain proportion of the CPU usage and have a  limited amount of disk space and bandwidth because of the other VPS users.</p>\n<p>Dedicated hosting</p>\n<p>Dedicated hosting is a specialized service that  offers the customer such important benefits such as secure, high-quality  infrastructure and high-speed connectivity. These costlier hosting packages can  be tailored to the unique needs of a customer for bandwidth, storage space and  memory, and "renting" an entire server that you do not have to share enables  you to run CPU-intensive programs. Your website performance will neither affect  other sites nor be disrupted by what others do.</p>\n<p>This type of dedicated hosting plan truly is the  ideal one for companies with large, complex, media-rich and/or high-traffic  sites. The "discrete server" model provides them complete control over the  structure, contents and operations of the hosting environment. Not every  individual or company needs dedicated hosting, but the ones that do could not  make it with lesser hosting packages. Past a certain point of bandwidth, there  is no reason to have any other kind of hosting plan.</p>\n<p>Managed hosting services</p>\n<p>Larger and busier firms often need a more advanced  kind of dedicated hosting plan, one that can give them additional technical  support and state-of-the-art equipment. These plans will also customize  services in such a way as to transfer many important responsibilities to the  hosting company. However, IT expertise is still required by the customer, who  retains control of the operating system(s), applications and hosting  environment. Managed hosting also involves a rather more significant investment  of time, effort, expertise, finances and human resources than other hosting  plans.</p>\n<p>If you opt for managed hosting, you would typically  lease dedicated, pre-configured equipment and connectivity from a provider. As  the owner of the data center, the provider will maintain the server, the  network and any other devices, and is responsible for deploying, monitoring,  managing and maintaining the hardware. With contractually defined, shared  responsibilities, managed hosting far exceeds basic dedicated hosting in levels  of performance, security, scalability and up-time.</p>\n<p>Semi-managed and reseller hosting</p>\n<p>Another name for semi-managed hosting is root server  hosting, a kind of dedicated hosting that lets you control the server through  access to the root. This approach produces a variety of benefits, such as  improved security, more reliable infrastructure and more proactive hardware  maintenance. As it is a semi-managed hosting plan, a hosting provider will  maintain and manage the installation and the hardware, while you (the client)  will manage the other aspects (backups, software upgrades, etc.). With root  access and administrator status, you can do virtually anything on your assigned  server.</p>\n<p>Reseller hosting is a way for businesses to host  sites on behalf of their own customers. If you are reselling hosting services  it means that you are making a contract with a hosting provider to sell their  services under your own name or brand. There is ample incentive for web hosting  firms to do this as it enables them to sell more dedicated hosting space. There  are as many different contracts, agreements and ways of doing this as there are  hosting companies, and it is certainly not something to be undertaken without  planning. However, for some companies it is a powerful addition to the business  plan.</p>\n<p>The right plan for you</p>\n<p>Depending on your needs, you may choose any of the  foregoing hosting plans. Or, as many companies do, you may start small and grow  into the costlier but more powerful packages. When you know how the hosting  plans work, you can do a better job comparing services and costs when you are  ready to set up (or expand) your site.</p>
