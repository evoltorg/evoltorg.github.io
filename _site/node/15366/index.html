<p>My name is the head lemur and I am a recovering Source Code Thief!</p></p><p><p>I started in 1994 with my first internet connection. Netscape and\nInternet Explorer  gave me the ability to peek behind the scenes. I\nthought that View Source would take me to the First Page of the\nInternet. It didn't.</p></p><p><p>Instead it revealed your code. All those weird characters that weren't\non the page suddenly appeared on my computer screen. I thought that I\nhad made a mistake, and when I went to close the Window it asked me if I\nwould like to Save It. I am weak. I said Yes.</p></p><p><p>I couldn't help myself. I binged. I spent hours, days, even weeks,\nstealing code. I began to study this HTML stuff. I stole more. My code\nstealing habit got so bad that I had to spend 400 dollars on a 40MB\nharddrive to have a place to keep it. I plundered, pillaged and looted.\nI stole entire sites and saved them on floppies. You could then.</p></p><p><p>Your code was mine. Then I discovered that I could take your images too.\nWith the images the code began to make sense. I saw nothing wrong. It\nwas there, I was here and all I needed to do was to save it. I saw the\nsame images appearing on all sorts of different sites. I felt no guilt.</p></p><p><p>Now I could push the code around and see what happened. It began to make\nsense. The things that worked, the things that didn't. I discovered\nentire websites that people built to give away free images, code\nsecrets, and links to sites that were giving away even more stuff.</p></p><p><p>I discovered a shareware HTML code editor. I stole that too.\nI began to build webpages.  It was orgasmic. I had the power to create\nmy own worlds. I could make big letters, I could make letters flow\naround pictures. I became enraptured with the power of a few simple\ntags. I stole, I coded, I stole.</p></p><p><p>I joined the HTML Writers Guild. I lurked, I saved, I stole. I stole the\ntips you gave me and hid them in my work. I built more pages. I\ndiscovered that I could put my pages on the web. I did. I stole my first\nFTP program. My theft knew no bounds. I began to learn about where the\nHTML code came from and how it was supposed to work. I printed pages of\nthe HTML 3.2 spec. I downloaded image editors, I downloaded browsers, I\nbought Netscape.</p></p><p><p>Copyright? Hah! Copyright just let me know that I was getting the\nfreshest stuff. Intellectual Property? Hah! Thanks for doing my work for\nme. You have saved me a lot of time so I could steal more code. God I\nloved cut and paste!! I stole a program to track the images I had\nstolen.\n</p>\n<p>I began to develop my own code, images, and styles. I became a web\ndesigner in 1997. One of my very first sites was stolen. Code, Images,\nContent and directory. It was one of my largest sites, having 80 pages\nand 20 handcrafted images. I had already stopped using other folks' stuff\nand began designing my own. I was outraged. I was angry. I screamed, I\nyelled, I wrote long raving rants about these thieves to every list I\ncould find.</p></p><p><p>It was the worst day of my web life.</p></p><p><p>When I contacted these miscreants, I discovered that My Client had given\npermission to post the fruits of my labors on another site. They hadn't\ndone anything different than I had done, except post it on the web.</p></p><p><p>I had to examine what I had been doing daily for the past three years.\nThis marked  the beginning of my recovery.</p></p><p><p>My stealing had been tapering off as so many people were sharing and\ngiving away their information, code and images. They were sharing with\nme, a source code thief.</p></p><p><p>They knew what I had been doing, and they forgave me. I would email them\nto ask permission to use something I had seen and they wrote back. They\nsaid sure, it's okay. That is how we all  learn on the web.</p></p><p><p>I came to realize that I was not a code god. I was not using anything\nyou could not use. My work can be seen by everyone with a browser and an\ninternet connection. I can be stolen from, judged on my code, have my\nsites and images stolen. That is how the web works. We all have the same\nbuilding blocks. Most of you are far better at arranging them than I.\nThis is how I learned. You will too. You may  never look at source\ncode. But I doubt it. You cannot hide HTML source code. It doesn't work\nthat way. This is the nature of the Internet. You may not binge like I\ndid.</p></p><p><p>The web is an Open System. The protocols, the tags, the hardware, are\nall available for examination and use. We have agreed implicitly and in\na lot of cases overtly that it is okay to look under the hood.</p></p><p><p>If you cannot accept the fact that <q>The Emperor Truly Has No Clothes</q> on\nthe web, this is not the place for you. I will respect your decision and\nwish you well in your new career.</p></p><p><p>Yes, I still peek.</p>
