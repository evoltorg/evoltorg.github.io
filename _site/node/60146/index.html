<ul>\n<li><strong>Job Title</strong> -- Software Design Engineer </li>	\n<li><strong>Job Code</strong> -- 50144  </li>\n<li><strong> Location</strong> -- WA - Issaquah </li>\n</ul></p><p><p>Microsoft is seeking qualified candidates to fill a full-time Software Development Engineer (SDE) position within our Global Services Automation Technology group.  You will be responsible for implementing the "client-side" portion of Microsoft's on-line support infrastructure. As a regular part of your responsibilities, you will have the opportunity to shape and contribute to the on-line support features of current and future versions of Microsoft operating systems and applications. You will be the "go-to" person for front-end code.</p>\n \n<p>As a successful candidate you are an expert in W3C standard HTML, CSS, DOM, and ECMAScript, and have demonstrated experience in developing and shipping rich, broad-reach applications for multiple client platforms including all popular versions of Internet Explorer, Netscape (4.x), Netscape (6+), Mozilla, Opera, MSN and AOL clients. </p></p><p><p>You have a good working knowledge of Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Mac OS 9 and OS X, and understand how the more popular browsers behave on each platform. Microsoft's on-line support infrastructure is dynamic, and relies heavily on XML and XSLT to prepare data for rendering, so the ability to work efficiently in XSLT is a must. You know what I18N means, and are familiar with issues related to rendering content in Far East and BiDi languages.</p></p><p><p>You should be competent in developing complimentary server-side components using C# or similar languages and technologies, have background in object-oriented development, and be experienced in commercial software development processes. Ideally you have experience in front-end development for sites similar to MSN, MSNBC or MSDN in scope and reach.  Real-world development experience with IIS, ASP.NET, C# and the .NET Framework, and working knowledge of HTTP and related protocols are strong positives. While Microsoft sites are developed and operated using Microsoft technologies, experience in developing and working with Apache, Perl, Linux and other competitive technologies are considered positives for this position.</p></p><p><h2>How To Apply</strong></h2>\n<p>\nTo apply, visit <a href="http://microsoft.com/careers/resume/">http://microsoft.com/careers/resume</a> and follow the instructions for submitting your resume. The Title and Job Code are listed above.
