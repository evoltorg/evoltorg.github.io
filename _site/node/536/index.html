<p>\n<b>More Seminars from Philip Greenspun:</b><br>\nRe-posted with his permission.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you liked my previous talk(s), you might want to come to a new,\nmore technical one-day course.  It will be held at Caltech on\nNovember 14.  See <a href="http://photo.net/teaching/one-day-tools.html">http://photo.net/teaching/one-day-tools.html</a>\nfor details.  The class is free and when you're finished you'll\nbe able to easily build something like amazon.com, ebay, or \nphoto.net in a matter of days with open-source tools.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you liked my previous one-day talk and think a friend or\ncolleague would be interested, please tell them that the course\nwill be repeated on November 13 at Caltech and November 20 at\nUniversity of California Berkeley.  They can register at \n<a href="http://register.photo.net">http://register.photo.net</a> \n</p>\n<p>\nThe ArsDigita Community System that you saw demonstrated at the \nprevious courses is getting steadily better.  It is being pushed\nforward partly by our students (at five universities now) but \nalso by ArsDigita.com, which is up to $12 million in sales and \n40 developers (proving that one need not be smart or lucky to \nsucceed in the Internet business).  See\n<a href="http://photo.net/doc/version-history.html">http://photo.net/doc/version-history.html</a> to keep up with the \nimprovements.\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally, if you know any 18-year-old kids or younger, please \ntell them to get ready to apply for the ArsDigita Prize (they \ncan check <a href="http://arsdigita.org">http://arsdigita.org</a> for details but the bottom line\nis that they get $10,000 and a trip to MIT if they build a \ntasteful non-commercial Web service).\n</p>\n
