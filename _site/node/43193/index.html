          <h2>Evaluating A Database</h2>
<p class="meta">23 Nov 2002</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Having worked with most of the databases available on the market today, I am not boasting that I am an expert on all of them, but I sincerely believe that every database can suit a particular organization's needs. An organization on the verge of making a decision for database or software should first do a thorough study of information needs. This article presents some guidelines for that study.</p>\n<p>Information today is more important than ever. Smart information is precious. In this age of information overload, I have found it necessary to disregard any information which is not related to my needs, and I am sure that 99% of you do the same.</p>\n<p>I want to write about Database Modelling and ER diagramming, but a layman might find that hard to understand. So let me try the simple ways...</p>\n<p>To narrow down the requirements of &quot;smart information,&quot; avoid the following:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Information that is not to the point</li> \n<li>Duplicate information</li> \n<li>Erroneous information</li> \n<li>Abstract information</li> \n<li>Subjective information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An organization's information can be viewed by the following types of people:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Customers (past, present, and future)</li> \n<li>Evaluators of the oragnization, auditors</li> \n<li>Suppliers </li> \n<li>miscellaneous creditors</li> \n<li>miscellaneous debtors</li> \n<li>Bankers</li> \n<li>Employees (past, present, and future)</li> \n<li>Management</li> \n<li>Other general viewers (external or internal)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These people need to view information of different categories. In order for the organization to provide the requisite information, a systematic study of the information requirements is necessary. When considering information requirements, keep the following features in mind: \n<ol> \n<li>Satisfying the related information seeker</li> \n<li>Satisfying the related information seeker</li> \n<li>Satisfying the related information seeker</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you follow these three magic points -- yes, they are all the same -- you will design the best database for the organization.</p>\n<p>When designing databases, keep in mind the features of a good information system:</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Make a blueprint (flowchart) of your database flow structure.</li> \n<li>Divide the information of the organization into secured and unsecured layers.</li> \n<li>Divide the basic database structure to suit different types of information seeker.</li> \n<li>Keep a good backup system to avoid crashes</li> \n<li>Avoid duplicate data entry system</li> \n<li>Allow easy access to unsecured databases related especially to customers</li> \n<li>Keep the databases simple. That should be the mantra so that easy debugging of complicated problems is possible.</li> \n<li>Archive obsolete information to access it when required.</li> \n<li>Categorize your main information seekers</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In short, you should have an information system which is robust, flexible, and can be managed even by a layman.</p>\n<p>I have seen different types of companies and their needs are different.</p> \n<ol> \n<li>Companies which produce and sell the finished products themselves</li> \n<li>Companies which are third party merchants who buy and sell on behalf of them</li> \n<li>Companies which act as intermediaries between the buyer and sellers</li> \n<li>Companies which provide services (airlines, hospitals, etc.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Influencing factors would be</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Information size</li> \n<li>Complexity of the flow of information</li> \n<li>Security for the information database</li>\n</ul> \n<p>If you want the best for your organization, do a thorough analysis of your information requirements and cross-reference these with all the database models available. The database which you think is best matched with your organization is your &quot;investment&quot;. Do not compromise your investment because of cost. Best of luck, and happy hunting.</p>
