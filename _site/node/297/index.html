          <h2>Bt Adsl Roll Out Plans Revealed</h2>
<p class="meta">29 Jul 1999</p>

<div class="post">
After 6 years of "testing" its high-speed ADSL network, British Telecom has revealed that it plans to introduce the service into only 10 cities by March 2000.<p>\nThe announcement was made this week, coinciding with industry regulator OFTEL's consultation document on how BT should open its networks to competition, and BT's proposed domination of high-speed internet access in the UK.<p>\nBT has responded by announcing that it will offer wholesale access to its ADSL network for competitors who wish to offer their own ADSL subscriptions. However, this is likely to lead to an end cost of between #50 and #150 per month for consumers.<p>\nSir Peter Bonfield, BT's chief exective, said that "This roll-out plan is a major step towards making Britain a world leader in the information revolution. By committing to a large scale roll-out, BT will play a vital part in stimulating a competitive mass-market for consumers as well as businesses of all sizes."<p>\nThe 10 cities to be blessed by BT's announcement are: Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, London, Manchester and Newcastle. The approximate 85% of the UK not covered by BT's plans can only hope that services will arrive before the turn of the next millenium.
