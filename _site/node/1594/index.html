<div class="post">
<P><I>This article is a pre-cursor to an article I'm publishing tomorrow that also\nrelates to Mozilla and the newly released Netscape 6. Hopefully by providing\nsome background on Mozilla project</i>  <i>separately, some points in my piece\ntomorrow will make more sense.</I>\n</P>\n <P> In January of 1998, Netscape made <a\nhref="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-325840.html?tag=" target="_new">the\nannouncement</a> that it would stop selling its Communicator software and\nwould open up the source code to its entire Communicator suite of applications,\nincluding Navigator, the application which displays and renders Web\npages. At the time, this was a revolutionary annuoncement and marked one of\nthe first times that a company would release the source code for software that\nit had previously sold to consumers. This in turn led to increased interest\n<I>and</I> acceptance in the 'open source' model of successfull products like\nthe <a href="http://www.linux.com" target="_new">Linux operating system</a> and the <a\nhref="http://www.apache.org" target="_new">Apache webserver</a>. </P>\n<P>\nThe move was applauded by open source / free software advocates around the\nworld, and on March 31 1998, the 8Mb of source code was released to the world\nfrom the newly formed <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_new">Mozilla</a> group. This group\nwould be responsible for managing the open source effort and coordinating the\nwork of internal Netscape (and down the road, Sun, AOL, and RedHat) engineers\nand independant developers. In retrospect, it was a <strong>very</strong>\nexciting thing to be a part of. I remember staying up all night on IRC waiting\nfor the word that the source was released on the servers, along with many many\nother people just like me. It felt like we were making history, and that this\nmove would redefine the way people used and developed for the Web.\n</P>\n<P>\nAfter the hysteria calmed, people started to realize just what a huge project\nthis was going to be. It was rather chaotic with everyone trying to figure out\njust where to start digging in the code. It was a big deal when someone\nfinally got it to compile about 2 or 3 days later.\n</P></p><p><P>\nOver the next year, things went pretty quietly. Netscape <a\nhref="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-328469.html?tag=" target="_new">announced that\nGecko</a>, its new and improved rendering engine - the piece of software that\nturns HTML into a readable webpage - would fully support HTML 4.0,\nCSS1, limited CSS2, XML, and the Document Object Model(DOM) as specified by the <a href="http://www.w3.org" target="_new">W3C</a>. This was a big\nannouncement because it showed that the open source influence had some effect\non how standards-compliant this software would be. Web developers were\nextremely pleased to know that they would finally have a rendering engine in a\nmajor browser that was fully standards-compliant. Things got heated when\nNetcape hinted they would release a 5.0 browser without the gecko engine,\nensuring that developers would have to wait another generation before\nthey'd get standards-compliance. Thanks to pressure from groups like the <a\nhref="http://www.webstandards.org" target="_new">Web Standards Project</a>, Netcape put\noff the release of a 5.0 browser until it could include the gecko engine.\n</P>\n<P>\nAmerica Online also made it clear that it was looking into\npurchasing Netcape Communications Corp., which raised fears among many that AOL would either kill\noff or limit resources (by cutting engineers, money, etc.) that went toward\nthis free, open source project. To its credit, AOL quickly made its <a\nhref="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-335990.html?tag=" target="_new">intentions\nclear</a> that Mozilla would continute on as planned.\n</P>\n<P>\nThat spring was plagued by delays and questions asking if Netscape would\nrelease a product under the Mozilla flag by its one year anniversery.\n</P>\n<p>\nApril 1st, 1999 was the one year anniversery of the birth of the Mozilla\nproject. It also proved to be a rather sad and uncertain time with lead\nevangelist Jamie Zawinski <a\nhref="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-340670.html?tag=st.ne.1005-200-341225-1005-200-341225." target="_new">leaving the project</a>\nand no 'product' shipped after a year's time. However, life moved on and the\nsummer of '99 proved to see some major improvements in the Mozilla browser.\nDuring this time, Netscape also <a\nhref="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-387924.html?tag=st.ne.1005-200-808813-1005-200-808813." target="_new">released</a>\nminor upgrades to the 4.x series of the Communicator suite including the\nWinamp MP3 player, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), and higher profile shopping links in\nthe <a href="http://home.netscape.com" target="_new">Netcenter</a> portal. \n</P>\n<P>\nTime rolled by, new milestones were reached. Thousands of bugs were squashed.\nSome shrugged off Mozilla as a 'Never-has-been' technology, but still the work\ncontinued.\n</P>\n<p>\nYesterday, the preview release of Netscape 6.0 was released to the general public\namid fanfare and Steve Case's predictions of <a\nhref="http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2522291,00.html" target="_new">AOL\nAnywhere</a>. Indeed, AOL's top man predicts that the company's new strategy\nwill revolutionize the way we use the Internet. Much of Case's predicted\nrevolution will rely on Mozilla technology - which is a revolution in itself.\n</P>
