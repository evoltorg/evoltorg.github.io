They will be the keys that will take your ecommerce site to the top 10 of the search results.</p><p>Here are the three elements you need to consider if you want to optimize your ecommerce site:</p><p>•	Include a title tag that contains targeted keywords and keyphrases. </p><p>•	Valuable web content that also contains targeted keywords and keyphrases; and</p><p>•	Incoming links from other relevant websites.</p><p>Basically, the elements mentioned above are the same elements that you will find in search engine optimization process for other websites. This is simply due to the fact that an ecommerce site needs the same things that other websites need – and that includes search engine optimization. Aside from giving your ecommerce site a higher ranking, these three elements are also essential in your goal to make your ecommerce site more search engine friendly.</p><p><b>Making Your Ecommerce Site More Search Engine Friendly</b><br></p><p>\nThe search engines define a search engine friendly site as one that can be easily spidered or crawled. If your site is easily indexed, then you can rightly say that is search engine friendly. Aside from the three elements mentioned above, how can you make your ecommerce site more search engine friendly? Remember that your ecommerce site should not be restricted by cookies, sessions Ids and even long URLs.</p><p>Now that you know how to make your ecommerce site more search engine friendly, you can start your optimization process by checking how search engine friendly your site is now. You can do this by doing a search on the search engines like Google. To check, key in site:www.domain.com on the search box. Google will show you the pages of your website.
