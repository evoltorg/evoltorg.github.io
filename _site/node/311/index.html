          <h2>Uk Government Appoints 1st Eminister</h2>
<p class="meta">05 Aug 1999</p>

<div class="post">
The British government has appointed a minister with specific responsibility for IT, liasing between government and industry.<p> The new minister has been named as Patricia Hewitt, a former consultant with Andersen Consulting, and her key task will be to ensure passage of the <a href='http://evolt.org/index.cfm?menu=8&cid=286'>Electronic Commerce Bill</a>. The new role is understood to have been recommended in a yet-to-be published prime ministerial report on eCommerce, and gives IT a more prominent role in government.<p> Likely future tasks for the post may include developing the government's corporate IT strategy, including delivering the stated aim of providing all governmental services electronically by 2008. <P>
