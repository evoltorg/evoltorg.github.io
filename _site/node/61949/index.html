<p class="meta">20 Feb 2009</p>

<div class="post">
Here are some of the features in this Login System that weren't included in the initial tutorial:</p><p>    * Better Security - Passwords are not stored in cookies, randomly generated ids take their place.\n    * Member Levels - Now users can be differentiated by what level they are (user, admin, etc.)\n    * Admin Center - As an admin, you have full control over registered users. You can view user info, upgrade/demote user levels, delete users, delete inactive users, and ban users.\n    * Visitor Tracking - You can now tell how many guests and users are actively viewing your site, and who those users are. You also know how many total members your site has.\n    * Account Info - Users can now view their own information, and edit it as well. They can also see the information of other users.\n    * Form Helper - No more ugly error pages! Now users are redirected to the form they filled out and the errors that have occurred are displayed.\n    * Forgot Password - Users who forget their password can have a new one generated for them and sent to their email address.\n    * Email - Now emails can be sent to newly registered users.\n    * Miscellaneous - Much better code design, smooth page transitions, and MORE!
