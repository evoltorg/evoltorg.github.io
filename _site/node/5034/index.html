<div class="post">
<p>\n A little over a year ago I wrote an <a\nhref="/article/Accessibility_The_Clock_is_Ticking/4090/485/index.html/"\ntitle="Accessibility, the clock is ticking">article here</a>  on the upcoming\n<A href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html"\ntarget="_blank">U.S. Accessibility Regulations</A> for the web. Section 508\nof the WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998, which required all United\nStates Federal Agencies, with websites, to have them accessible to\nindividuals with disabilities, within 24 months of\nenacting of this law.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/news/508-final.htm"\ntarget="_blank" title="Final Standards">Regulations</a> are finally out and\nthe clock has started ticking again. \n</p>\n<p>\n"<cite>But I don't work for the government,</cite>" you cry!  Probably true.\nBut the impact of these regulations will extend far beyond the .gov domain.\nIf you work for a University or other .edu that takes federal grants and\nhave a website, surprise! It's gonna be your day in the barrel\ntoo.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of the lesser known provisions of the The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the <STRONG><I>"effective communication rule"</I></STRONG></p>\n<p>In a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/foia/cltr204.txt" target="_blank">Letter</a> dated September 9, 1996, to Sen. Tom Harkin, Deval L. Patrick, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division had this to say, </p>\n<blockquote>"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires State and\nlocal governments and places of public accommodation to furnish\nappropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to ensure\neffective communication with individuals with disabilities,\nunless doing so would result in a fundamental alteration to the\nprogram or service or in an undue burden.  28 C.F.R. . 36.303; 28\nC.F.R. . 35.160.  Auxiliary aids include taped texts, Brailled\nmaterials, large print materials, and other methods of making\nvisually delivered material available to people with visual\nimpairments."</blockquote>\n<blockquote>"Covered entities under the ADA are required to provide\neffective communication, regardless of whether they generally\ncommunicate through print media, audio media, or computerized\nmedia such as the Internet.  Covered entities that use the\nInternet for communications regarding their programs, goods, or\nservices must be prepared to offer those communications through\naccessible means as well."</blockquote>\n<p>\nThis letter  suddenly expanded the rules to include State and local\ngovernment websites. It also opens the door for interpretation of\naccessibility claims against commercial websites. If you have a .com that\ndoes business with the government, you may need to determine if these\nregulations apply to you. Lots of sites, Lots of Lawyers, connect the\ndots.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is Good  News. Some of you are currently unemployed. The implosion\nof the pure play dot.com websites, has with the arrival of these\nregulations,  presents a golden opportunity for new jobs. A lot of new jobs.\nBefore sending out those resumes, let's look at what work the government has\ndone.\n</p>\n<h2>Uncle Sam Needs YOU</h2>\n<p>\nThe regulations gave the enforcement authority to the Department Of\nJustice. On April 2, 1999, the Attorney General<a\nhref="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/memohead.html" target="_blank"> issued a\nmemorandum</a> to the heads of all Federal agencies advising them of the\nrequirements of Section 508 and providing instructions for conducting\nself-evaluations of their electronic and information technology.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe United States Government has over <a href="http://www.firstgov.gov"\ntarget="_blank" title="First Gov. The US Government Portal ">20,000</a>\nwebsites. <br>3,028 Web <strong>pages</strong> were surveyed.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThis effort on the part of the DOJ although representing a small sample\nwas a good faith effort to measure compliance and to give a heads up on\nthese regulations. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis information was collected, collated and presented in a report. On\nJuly 22, 1999 the Justice Department released <a\nhref="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/report/web.htm" target="_blank">this\nreport</a> on the state of Federal Websites.  This report pointed out that a\nnumber of tools and technologies currently in use for disseminating\ninformation on the taxpayers dime are not accessible.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/report/web.htm#N_4_" target="_blank"\ntitle="Government Accessibility Report">Note 4</a> of this report states:\n</p>\n<blockquote>"4. The Department was careful to limit the degree and\nscope of conclusions drawn from the data provided by agencies, for the\nsimple reason that many of the components appeared to misunderstand some of\nthe questions. Spot-checks conducted by the Department of the Web sites --\nthe URL's of which were reported on the survey forms -- revealed that many\nof them did not contain the features the components identified them as\ncontaining. For instance, 592 Web pages were identified as containing\n"applets." The Department, after reviewing a majority of these\npages, did not find a single applet in a spot-check of most of\nthem."</blockquote>\n<blockquote>"There are many possible explanations for this observation.\nIt is possible that as components identified accessibility problems with\ncertain types of features (e.g., applets), they deleted the offending\nfeatures from their Web pages rather than making them accessible. It is more\nlikely, however, that many of those who evaluated Web pages were not\nsufficiently careful or knowledgeable to correctly identify features of\ntheir Web pages." </blockquote>\n<p>\n Taken to task in the presentation arena were Java applets, imagemaps,\nMicrosoft PowerPoint and Adobe Acrobat .pdf files\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile robust, Java applets have a number of issues which, in order to\npresent accessible information, makes their use problematic.\nImagemaps with the correct use of alt-tags present less of a\nchallenge, but require thought. PowerPoint presentations are severely\nlimited by not only accessibility concerns, but also by requiring a\ncopy of PowerPoint to view.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/main.html"\ntarget="_blank">Adobe</a> is  one of the major players for tools that are\nused daily across the world for building websites.  Adobe's Portable\nDocument Format is one of the  most robust document formats. It gave\nWhat-You-See-Is-What-You-Get or "WYSIWYG" real meaning.\n It is a very good format for presenting information considered final, which\nis why it used extensively for legal documents. That's the good news.\n</p>\n<p>\n On July 22, 1999, the Department of Education issued an overall agency\nreport. This report summarized the accessibility challenges faced by\nagencies which choose to put documents in Adobe Acrobat's pdf format:\n</p>\n<blockquote>The Portable Document Format (PDF) has provided one of the most\ncontroversial\naccessibility problems of the decade.  PDF documents, by the nature of the\nmedium, are portable, cross-platform, generally tamper-proof, and render in\nexacting detail, representations of the original print document's fonts,\nformatting,\netc.</blockquote>\n<p>\nAccording to the Justice Department report:\n</p>\n<blockquote>"17. Recently, in a presentation to federal agency\nofficials and employees, representatives from Adobe explained that their\nnewly released version of Adobe Acrobat included many accessibility features\nthat, if used correctly, could be used to create files that were easily\naccessible to users with disabilities. Adobe's Accessibility Seminar, Feb.\n2, 2000, IRS Building. Word processed documents that are "printed"\nto pdf instead of "scanned" to pdf are much more likely to work\nwell with Adobe's access utility. <em><strong>Adobe clarified that it sees\nits job as simply to provide the tools for making accessible files, not to\nteach users how to use these tools to make files more accessible."\n</strong></em>(My Emphasis)</blockquote>\n<p align="right"><a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/report/content.htm"\ntarget="_blank">Information Technology and People with Disabilities:<br>\nThe Current State of Federal Accessibility April 2000</a></p>\n<p>\nThe government has done its homework. \n</p>\n<p>\nA private report came out in September: Assessing E-Government: The\nInternet, Democracy, and Service Delivery by State and Federal\nGovernments.<br>\nThis is the executive summary:\n</p>\n<ol>\n <li>only 5 percent of government websites show some form of security\npolicy and 7 percent have a privacy policy</li>\n <li>15 percent of government websites offer some form of disability\naccess, such as TTY (Text Telephone) or TDD (Telephone Device for the Deaf)\nor are approved by disability organizations.</li>\n <li>4 percent offer foreign language translation features on their\nwebsites</li>\n <li>22 percent of government websites offer at least one online\nservice</li>\n <li>a few of the sites are starting to offer commercial advertising,\nwhich raises problematic issues for the public sector</li>\n <li>91 percent of the sites responded to a sample email requesting the\nofficial office hours of the particular agency and three-quarters did so\nwithin one business day </li>\n <li>states vary enormously in their overall ranking based on our\nanalysis.

Stay tuned for new versions of your favorite\ntools with accessibility features.\n</p>\n<h2>The Developer's Dilemma</h2>\n<p>\nThere are over 20 million registered domain names, around 5 billion\npages, and another 1000 sites have come online since you started reading\nthis article.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Center for Applied Special Technologies, whose <a\nhref="http://www.cast.org/bobby/" target="_blank" title="BOBBY Home">BOBBY\nValidator</a> allows you to check your sites for Accessibility, has a page\ndevoted to sites that validate for Accessibility. There are only 1284\nentries as of this writing.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe code we use is changing. <a href="http://w3c.org" target="_new">HTML\n4.01</a>, XML, CSS2, all of these are getting better for us, but as we wait for the\nbrowsers to catch up, we also must remember that not everyone has our toys,\nis able-bodied, or even sees. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe range of tools for coding spans the spectrum from text editors to\nvisual design suites that create code as you move design elements across\nyour screen. Which in some cases is a   magnificent collection of the finest\nhardware and software available. But  the best tools on the market will not\nguarantee accessible code or design. This is your job.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe tools for enabling accessibility are free. That's right!! F R E E. The <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C Validator</a> is free. The <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html"\ntarget="_blank">W3C CSS Validator</a> is Free. The <a href="http://www.cast.org/bobby/" target="_blank">BOBBY Validator</a> is Free.\n</p>\n<p>\nValidation is a few keystrokes away. Your job just got a lot harder.\n"I'm not using Java, javascripting, DHTML, Flash or Quicktime"\nyou cry!  "I don't need but a handfull of tags!"\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>POP QUIZ!</strong><br>How many browsers support <code><accesskey></code>?\n</p>\n<p>\nWelcome to browser hell. There are three major visual browsers, Internet\nExplorer, Netscape Navigator, and Opera. None of these allow you to use the\nentire range of accessibility tags. Nor is the support for the usable ones\nconsistent. Platform dependancy create rendering issues.  Lynx is a text\nbrowser. Limited formatting and no  visuals allowed here. Screen Readers\nrequire a whole new mindset in respect to using tables for presenting\ncontent.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Testing, Testing, Testing.</strong><br>You can build the cleanest\npages possible and validate them, but unless you test them in every browser\nyou can get your hands on and get your friends who work in different\nenvironments to test them, you will not be sure.\n</p>\n<p>\nBuilding valid websites is easy. Building compliant websites is hard. You\nhave to make  conscious decisions to include text browsers, screen readers,\nand aural information. Cascading Style Sheet support is such a mess that\nzeldman has 1, 2, 3, 4 articles devoted to what you <em>can't</em> use. \n</p>\n<p>\nIf you build websites  for the goverment, you will probably get a big\nmanual with chapter and verse. \n</p>\n<p>\nIf you build websites for business, sooner or later the folks whose money\nyou took will probably get a email from someone who wants to buy your\nclients stuff, but can't because you made a decision not to make their site\naccessible.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese regulations point to a  new era of website development.\nAccessibility in website design is not a  crisis  of confidence, it is a\nchallenge to your creativity, knowlege, and ability to create a web for\neveryone. Governments will do it, because it is our tax dollar. Companies\nwill do it because it is a bottom line issue. You will do it because you\nlove a challenge.\n</p>\n<h2>Further Reading</h2>\n<p>\n<a href="http://www.alistapart.zeldman.com/stories/ticking/"\ntitle="Accessibility the clock is ticking" target="_blank">Accessibility the clock is\nticking</a><br><A\nhref="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html" target="_blank">WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT OF\n1998</A><BR>\n<A\nhref="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/foia/cltr204.txt" target="_blank">Effective Communication\nRule</A><br>\n<A href="http://www.access-board.gov/pubs/eitaacrpt.htm" target="_blank">EITAAC\nReport</A><BR>\n<A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/" target="_blank">Web Content\nAccessibility Guidelines 1.0</A><BR>\n<A\nhref="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-AUTOOLS/" target="_blank">W3C 'Authoring Tool Accessibility\nGuidelines'</A><BR>\n<A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/" target="_blank">W3C 'User\nAgent\nAccessibility Guidelines'</A><BR>\n<A href="http://www.evolt.org//article/Accessibility_more_than_the_right_thing_to_do/4090/381/index.html">\nAccessibility: more than the right thing to do</A><BR>\n</p>\n<p>\nA special thanks to Marlene Bruce for editing help.<br>\nThis article originally appeared at <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a>.\n</p>
