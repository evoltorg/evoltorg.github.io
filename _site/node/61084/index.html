The powerful technology also offers fast downloading of multimedia content and a range of interesting features like video-calling and photo blogging. Blogging can get as simple as that or even more complex. Oh and you bet, I’ll be blogging about that. Remember when blogging, do not write un-useful content, people love to read informing texts, just think about it, what is it your are reading right now.</p><p>The responses I received ranged from odd looks to questions about the blogging practice. Google Blog search has the unprecedented potential to bring the mainstream surfer into blogging, even more than Yahoo's RSS Headlines pioneered the start of making RSS mainstream about a year ago. Here are a few things you might want to consider adding to your arsenal of blogging tools. A company should have a list of policies regarding blogging to ensure that trade secrets are kept secret and personal lives do not become public.\n \nThe answer can better help you hone in on your online marketing, pod casting and blogging efforts. All the time I spend with blogging can actually be divided in5large chunks:   Setup and maintenance of my blog: setting up the blog, installing plugins, blog design, In the next few series of articles, I will try and deal with some of the very basic technical jargon and skills that one needs when facing this daunting world of web-site creation, blogging and getting listed and noticed by the Search Engines.\n \nSince of this, you may think blogging is part journalism and part political commentary, and therefore not of interest to you or the advancement of your business.

In the past few years’s fads like Crocs shoes, The Adkins Diet, blogging, stainless steel kitchen appliances, Tickle Me Elmo Dolls, Adjustable Rate Mortgages, innumerable TV shows and entertainers have captured outsized portions of their marketplace.\n \nSplogging or spam blogging has thus become rampant among webmasters trying to gain an improved ranking in search engine result pages.

However, instant photo sharing through MMS or email and fun features like Picture Blogging makes the integrated camera a nice addition to the feature list.\n </p><p>Blogs When I first started blogging on My Space on my personal profile, I gained quite a following because of some strategies that I implemented. Capture precious moments of life with resolution as high as 1600x1200 pixels or in high quality videos with the Nokia 7373 to be shared with friends via MMS, email or even picture blogging once you’ve transferred the images and video clips to your computer.
