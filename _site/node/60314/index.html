          <h2>Don T Submit Your Website To Any Search Engines</h2>
<p class="meta">22 Apr 2004</p>

<div class="post">
<p>That's right - this search engine optimisation article is telling you not to submit your website to any search engines. Not Google, not Inktomi, not AltaVista. Sounds a bit strange? Read on...</p></p><p><h2>Submitting to all the search engines</h2>\n<p>Submitting your website to every search engine is an incredibly <strong>time-consuming</strong> process. There are hundreds and hundreds of them out there - no doubt, you've come across the companies who'll submit your website to 1000 search engines for you.</p></p><p><p>Search engine professionals know that the vast majority of these search engines have a very low usage rate and will drive hardly any traffic your way. In fact, it's only a handful of search engines that drive the majority of traffic from search engines to websites.</p></p><p><h2>The major search engines</h2>\n<p>Some of the most important search engines, probably accounting for over 90% of the search engine market, are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> (read about <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/searchday/article.php/3314171" title="Read the Search Engine Watch article">Yahoo!'s new search engine</a>)</li>\n<li><a href="http://www.inktomi.com/">Inktomi</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.teoma.com/">Teoma</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.fast.com/">Fast</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.altavista.com/">AltaVista</a></li>\n</ul></p><p><p>Not heard of some of these search engines? Have a look at who powers who with this excellent <a href="http://www.bruceclay.com/searchenginechart.pdf" title="Download the pdf document (78kb)">search engine relationship chart</a>.</p></p><p><p>Please note that the new MSN search engine will roll out at the end of 2004 and will be very important.</p></p><p><h2>Don't submit to these search engines</h2>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;But there's only six of them - why on earth not!?&rdquo;</strong> Well, aside from saving time and a bit of money (some require a submission fee), quite simply there's no need. Allow me to explain...</p></p><p><p>Search engines crawl the web every few weeks (or months) looking for websites to index. Here's how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search engines start at one website with a large number of outbound links (usually a directory)</li>\n<li>They <strong>follow every link</strong> they come across, indexing each page they arrive at</li>\n<li>Once a page has been indexed they follow all the links from that page</li>\n<li>And so on until there are no more links to follow</li>\n</ul></p><p><p>Unless today is your very first day on the Internet, you might have heard that inbound links into a website are extremely important in establishing its search engine ranking. If a search engine can't find you by itself through crawling the web, then your website doesn't have any inbound links. If so, you'll never achieve a decent search engine ranking so <strong>what's the point in registering?</strong></p></p><p><h2>Getting incoming links quickly</h2>\n<p>So, how do you get incoming links? Well, this is a vast topic which I won't be discussing now, but if you want to get a few good links quickly then there is a solution: <strong>web directories</strong>. If your website is listed in the <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! directory</a> (not the same as Yahoo! search) and the <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/">Open Directory</a> (which Google uses) all the search engines should find you within two to three months.</p></p><p><p>There are plenty of other directories you should get listed in too. Global, local and industry-specific directories abound on the Internet. To find them run a search for &lsquo;web directory&rsquo; on your favorite search engine. The directories that come up highest in the search rankings will probably generate the most traffic. You can also check these directories of directories:</p></p><p><ul>\n<li><a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/">Open Directory's directory of web directories</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.searchenginecolossus.com">Search engine colossus</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.seo-lab.com/directory-articles/best-free-directories.php">Best Free Directories</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.isedb.com/html/Web_Directories/">Internet search engine database</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.directory-pages.com">Business Directory </a></li>\n</ul></p><p><p>Another even quicker solution is webmaster forums. <strong>Search engines love forums</strong> because they include so much fresh content. Most have an area where you're allowed to enter your <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym> to get feedback from other webmasters. <a href="http://www.webmasterforumlist.com/" title="Go to the Webmaster forum list website">Find some forums</a>, sign up, and get posting!</p></p><p><p>To find out more about building up links to your website please read the article, <a href="http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/search-engine-optimisation/build-up-links-website.shtml">Build up links to your website</a>.</p></p><p><h2>A quick fix</h2>\n<p>It can take a couple of months to get listed in some web directories. If you can't wait that long then it might be worth submitting your site into a paid program and &quot;artificially&quot; boosting your rankings. Again, this is a whole new topic so please feel free to read more about the <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/webmasters/article.php/2167941" title="Read the Search Engine Watch article">paid submission options</a>.</p></p><p><h2>Long term strategy</h2>\n<p>Search engine optimisation is a long term strategy. You'll be successful if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Structure your pages correctly by <a href="http://www.webcredible.co.uk/user-friendly-resources/search-engine-optimisation/basics.shtml#where-keywords">positioning your keywords in effective places</a></li>\n<li>Build a great site with unique content that other websites will want to link</li>\n</ul></p><p><p>Register with as many web directories as possible and then concentrate your efforts on these two things. Within a few months you'll start to see success.</p>
