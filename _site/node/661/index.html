Q. What's the one thing that a lot of web developers would like to add to their sites, but tend to hold back because of bandwith limitations for many users?</p><p>A. Graphics.</p><p>Sure, not all graphics are good. But some graphics are great, and if used properly, can create a very aesthetic site that is very appealing and attractive to the users. The result: more people flock to your site, which is good news for you. </p><p>But with todays limitations on bandwith, many web developers tend to be conservative with using graphics.</p><p>Well, all of this is about to change. </p><p>Why? The new <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG19991228S0028">JPEG2000 wavelet compression spec was approved</a>. This means good news for all of us. This specs shows a 3MB pic compressed to 19KB, with virtually no signs of compression. The article also talks more about the spec, including uses of compressed animation and jpegs.</p><p>Impressive, I say. So, what will your web sites look like when this goes public?
