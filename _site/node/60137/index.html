          <h2>Syndication Sharing Content Across Websites</h2>
<p class="meta">30 Apr 2003</p>

<div class="post">
<p>The Internet is rapidly becoming a popular way to\ndisseminate content or to collect and redistribute it via other websites and\nintranets. The term syndication was originally used in the world of print media to\nrefer to a news agency that sells news articles, comic strips or crossword puzzles\nto many newspapers under the assumption that readers buy only one of them. On the\nweb, the idea of content syndication is basically similar - one party makes the\ncontent of its website available in such a manner that many other parties can pick\nit up via the Internet, automatically and as often as needed.</p></p><p><p>Not only news agencies use syndication to distribute their news. Record companies syndicate advertisements\npromoting their latest album releases, which are picked up and used by music\nretailers to add value to their websites. Similarly, international corporations\nsyndicate business information, and stock exchanges around the world publish share\nprices in real time. Banks, investment brokers and institutional investors pick up\nthese newsfeeds to monitor developments in a particular industry sector or even in\nspecific companies and to watch trends in the stock markets.</p></p><p><p>Syndicated content is distributed via so-called <q>newsfeeds</q> that are received and displayed on other\nwebsites, intranets or personal desktops. New applications are being developed to display syndicated content on devices other than websites and intranets, such as\npersonal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones. In this issue we discuss how content syndication can benefit your organization. We explain the technology in\nclear and non-technical language and suggest some issues that you may wish to address before you decide that your organization should also start using this Internet technology.</p></p><p><h2>How can content syndication benefit your organization?</h2>\n<p>The decision as to whether your organization actually needs to adopt content\nsyndication, and how best to use this Internet technology, will depend on your\norganization's mission, and the purpose and functions of your website. For example:\n</p>\n<ol></p><p><li><strong>Content distribution:</strong> Your organization wishes to promote the information services\noffered by your website. Applying syndication, you can offer a newsfeed via which\nheadlines and links to the content on your site can be picked up by any number of\norganizations and displayed on their websites or intranets.</li>\n<li><strong>Content gathering:</strong> Your organization wishes to monitor developments in a particular field of interest.\nYou can pick up other organizations' newsfeeds (one or more) and display the\nheadlines and links on your intranet. In this way, your staff will be able to access\n- via your intranet - daily updated headline news from various selected websites.\nThis feature of content syndication could also add value to your website by\ndisplaying the latest headline news and links of selected organizations on your\nwebsite. This could be useful, for example, if your organization is preparing a\nconference, conducting an advocacy campaign, or monitoring a specific situation,\nsuch as a regional conflict.</li>\n<li><strong>Content brokering:</strong> Your organization functions as a\nknowledge centre, and wishes both to distribute and to gather content related to one\nor more topics. In this case, you could strengthen your organization's position by\ndistributing your own content as well as providing web pages where visitors can find\nthematic headline information with links to the complete articles posted on a large\nnumber of other sites.</li>\n<li><strong>Content networking</strong>: Your organization is part of a\nknowledge sharing network that wishes to exchange content among the members on a\nregular basis. For this, each participating organization could install a newsfeed on\nits website and pick up the headlines and links provided by the other network\nmembers.</li>\n</ol></p><p><p>These are still early days for content syndication, and new applications of this\nnovel means of exchanging and sharing information are actively being explored. For\nexample, content syndication can be used to compile automatically the content of\nemail newsletters, as well as to update discussion forums, conference agendas,\ntheatre programmes, or sales promotion campaigns for games, photos and software.\n</p></p><p><h2>What Exactly Is Content Syndication?</h2>\n<p>Content syndication on the web refers to a technology that facilitates the distribution of content from one computer to any\nnumber of other computers via the Internet. Content syndication does not entail the\ndistribution of the complete articles, images or files. Rather, it offers\ninformation about the website where the content can be found, and headline\ninformation with links to the web pages where the complete content can be accessed.\nThe basic element of content syndication is the syndication file, which is located\non the web server of the distributor of the content. This file contains information\nabout the site, the headlines and the links to web pages containing the content.</p></p><p><p>For example, the syndication file on the server of a newspaper could include:\n<ol type="i"> <li>the\ntitle of the newspaper;</li>\n<li>the headlines of articles published on its website; and</li>\n<li>links to the full texts of these articles. An example of such a syndication\nfile can be viewed by opening the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/syndication/feeds/news/ukfs_news/world/rss091.xml" target="_blank" title="BBC&acute;s news syndication file">BBC's news syndication file</a> in your browser.</li></ol></p><p><p>Content syndication was first popularized by Netscape in 1999, for adding and updating news\nfrom selected web sources to its personalized <cite><a href="http://my.netscape.com" target="_blank" title="My.Netscape">My.Netscape</a></cite> pages.\nFor this purpose, Netscape developed RSS ('Rich Site\nSummary' or renamed by some: 'Really Simple Syndication'), a format for syndication files based on\nXML, a computer language used for describing, storing and exchanging information.\n</p></p><p><p>With these RSS files, Netscape no longer required an army of editors to gather\ncontent to fill its ever-growing portal. Instead, webmasters or content distributors\ncould create newsfeeds by placing RSS files on their servers and submitting\ninformation about their exact location. All that Netscape then needed to do was to\ncollect these newsfeeds at regular intervals and display their contents on its\nportal, thus offering its visitors a continuously updated set of headlines and links\nto the latest information posted on many websites. \n</p>\n<p>Netscape thus created a mutually\nbeneficial relationship between the visitors to its portal and the content\ndistributors. The visitors could view the latest news headlines published on a wide\nrange of websites from which they could make their own selection, and the content\ndistributors benefited from the increased numbers of visitors who followed the links\nattached to the headlines to their websites.\n</p>\n<h2>Syndication Servers</h2>\n<p>News can be syndicated directly among websites or intranets, or it can be gathered by so-called\nsyndication servers, or content aggregators, that bring together many newsfeeds in a\ncentral location. Examples include <a href="http://moreover.com" target="_blank" title="Moreover">Moreover</a>,\n<a href="http://www.syndic8.com" target="_blank" title="Syndic8">Syndic8</a> and <a href="http://newsisfree.com" target="_blank" title="News is Free">News is Free</a>.\n</p>\n<p>These syndication\nservers offer many facilities for selecting newsfeeds (e.g. BBC World News, SciDev\nor Oneworld) and displaying their content in a variety of ways. For example,\nsyndicated content from selected newsfeeds can be included on an organization's\nwebsite simply by cutting and pasting a single line of code into the HTML code of\nthe webpage where this content is to be displayed. Once this code has been inserted,\nany changes in the content (such as new articles added to or old ones deleted from\nthe BBC World News section or Oneworld site) are reflected in the headline\ninformation and links displayed on your website.\n</p>\n<h2>What Issues Need to be Addressed?</h2>\n<p>From the point of view of the management of an organization, the main challenges\nposed by content syndication are not technical. Content syndication is a low-tech\nInternet technology that does not require new equipment or software. All your\ntechnical team has to do is to create a newsfeed by placing an RSS file on your web\nserver, and keep it up to date. If your website has been set up on the basis of a\ncontent management system, a function can be added to generate an RSS file and to update it automatically\nwhenever the content of your website is changed. Otherwise, changes to an RSS file\ncan be made manually using a simple word processor such as Notepad, or with so-\ncalled 'scrapers', i.e. services available on the web to generate and automatically\nupdate an RSS file (e.g. <a href="http://myrss.com/new.html" target="_blank" title="myRSS">myRSS</a>).</p></p><p>\n<p>For any organization that decides to take advantage of content syndication, the major challenges are\nrelated to the generation and regular maintenance of the content, as well as the\nselection of newsfeeds to appear on your website or intranet. For example,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you\ndecide to syndicate your organization's web content, considerable effort will be\nneeded on an ongoing basis to ensure the quality of the information, in terms of\nstyle, clarity and timeliness. For instance, if a visitor clicks on an eye-catching\nheadline, but this leads only to a dull, incomprehensible and/or out of date piece\nof text on your site this will do nothing to enhance your organization's image and\ncredibility, and that visitor is unlikely to return.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you decide\nto include the newsfeeds of other organizations on your own website, then these must\nbe chosen with care. A poor selection of newsfeeds may result in a display of\nheadlines that may be inappropriate for your site - for example, the scope may be\ntoo broad, they may be promoting own institutional or donors' interests, etc.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In short, if you wish to engage your organization - as a content distributor, gatherer,\nbroker or net worker - in content syndication, you may need to review your\ninformation and communication strategy to ensure that high priority is given to the\ncontent management of your website or intranet.\n</p>
