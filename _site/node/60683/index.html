In this article i plan to go over, and explain the 10 most common SEO misconceptions or confusions. I hope it helps you!</p><p>1. Outbound Links DONT improve PR or SERP\nThis is the most common misconception. People think that by linking to good sites eg. google.com, you can get higher SERP. The only things that outbound links can do is DECREASE your PR and SERP. Linking to Link Farms, for example, can get your site penalized.</p><p>2. To get high SERP you need stacks of META tags\nA while ago, search engine algorithims were based around META tags. Not so any more. Most search engines dont even use them in their algorithium! The only notable one is Yahoo!, but META tage have little weight. You can get penalized for having hundreds of similar META tags as well.</p><p>3. .HTML pages get higher PR\nNot True! No matter what you call your files, the output (that the search engines see) is ALL HTML! It makes no difference</p><p>4. some TLD types get better link quality\nNot True again! All TLD and other domain names have the same potential for getting PR and high SERP.</p><p>5. Hyphens in domain names dont do anything\nHyphens in domain names serve to seperate keywords. This can be very useful, as search engines cant always automatically seperate them. An example of this is:\nlinksexchange.com\ncould be read as: link excange or link sex change, both of which are very different.</p><p>6. Too MANY hyphens in domain names get your site listed as SPAM\nIncorrect! The most having lots of hyphens in your domain name is that your site is flagged for human review. The only reason alot of SPAM sites have lots of hyphens is because they want to get listed for many keywords.</p><p>7. Automated SEO software gets your site banned\nIncorrect! The only way automated SEO software could get your site banned is:\ni) using illegal techniques\nii) linking to dodgy sites</p><p>8. Image links are better than text\nImage links dont have anchor text. This is the text that the user sees to click on. Having good anchor text can get your site high SERP for the keywords in it. Images have an ALT tag, but this has little weight due to keyword spamming.</p><p>9. I can use Blackhat SEO to get high SEO\nSure, you can use BlackHat SEO to get high SERP, but you will most probably get caught. Search engines can now see if text is hidden from the user, and other Blackhat techniques.</p><p>10. I can get a high PR in a month!\nYou Cant! Your domain normally gets a penalty placed on it until it is around 6-months old. After this, your rankings will increase\n
