          <h2>Shopping For A Used Car</h2>

<div class="post">
Most people would have tried <a href="http://www.unocardealers.com/buy_a_car.jsp">buying a used car</a> at-least once in their lifetime. Statistically, people change their car once in three to five years, if not sooner. If they need to buy a better car, and get a  good deal on it, then they need to know exactly how to spot a good used car from a bad one.</p><p>The starting point of getting a good deal on a used car comes at the source of the used car. One can find a good used car at a car dealer. But <a href="http://www.unocardealers.com/dlr/cmp_plans.jsp">cars from a dealer</a> come with their own premium attached to it. If it is a certified used car, the premium is even higher.</p><p>Buying a used car directly from the owner can give a better price. But this needs additional effort on part of the buyer, in being able to locate sellers of <a href=" http://www.unocardealers.com/sell_used_car.jsp">used cars</a>, and contacting them individually.</p><p>Here is where sites like <a href=" http://www.unocardealers.com">www.unocardealers.com</a> can help. This site has a ton of listings from individual sellers of used cars, that sellers can browse through.</p><p>
