Within your target market, find a business or company that has a website or its very own ezine. Approach and ask them if they want to join your affiliate program and if it would be possible for you to promote what you are offering on their site or ezine. </p><p>In return for this, offer to give your product for free. If you have your own ezine or website, offer to promote something for them also. Try to make an offer that they will find mouth-watering. </p><p>Make use of your very own subscribers and visitors. Nothing like giving out something for free to make them come running to your site. In these freebies, put your advertisement. It does not have to be too obvious. A subtle ad that has a link back to you is more than enough. </p><p>Using this technique, you will have an advertisement of yourself spread everywhere. Both you and your visitor get to profit from this style. By giving some of your own, you will get more than what is expected. </p><p>Do not get into a losing resistance. You cannot always win them all. Why not join them? Look for others having the same business as yours and form your own joint venture team.

Let them know that you are partnering with other ezine publishers for your discounted offer and that you will give the ezine publisher who gives the most result a bonus. </p><p>But you have to make sure your bonus is very good.

Tell them that you will promote their products is they will also promote yours. If both of you do not have anything to offer for this contest, you can always come up with something together. </p><p>Explain to them the benefits that this will bring to you and to them. This is a way of building a good relationship and partnership. By the time you approach them with another idea for a joint venture, they will go all out in helping you because they already have a trust on you. </p><p>Columns are another joint venture idea.
