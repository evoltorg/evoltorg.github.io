<p>Having unsuccessfully tried to outlaw pretty much everything (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/17324.html" target="_new" title="Opens in a new window">forwarding email</a>, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/17943.html" target="_new" title="Opens in a new window">gambling</a>, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/archive/17303.html"  target="_new" title="Opens in a new window">stuff not suitable for kids</a> (except McDonalds, of course)) online, Australia's <a href="http://www.richardalston.dcita.gov.au/"  target="_new" title="Opens in a new window">Senator Richard Alston</a> has decided that the Australian Labor Party's plan to ensure that every Australian home would have cable Internet access by 2006 is <q>a costly waste of time</q>.</p></p><p><p>\nThis wouldn't be a problem, except that Richie-boy runs the Oz <a href="http://www.dcita.gov.au/" target="_new" title="Opens in a new window">Department for Communications and Information Technology</a>, which essentially means that it's not going to happen.\n</p></p><p><p>\nWhich is a little bit odd as he was a key mover in <a href="http://www.connect-world.com/docs/articles/cwasia2q99/alstonaustraliacwasia2q99.asp" target="_new" title="Opens in a new window">ensuring that all Australians had equal access to telecommunications</a> in the first place.\n</p>\n<p>\nApparently the reason for stamping on the proposal is that Singapore's 98% cable coverage is only used by 2% of the population, and South Korea only uses so much bandwidth because of kids playing games. &quot;There's no role for government in facilitating that roll-out,&quot; he said. &quot;My kids don't need any help in that regard.&quot;\n</p>\n<p>\nNice to see elected officials thinking of the country first, eh?\n</p>
