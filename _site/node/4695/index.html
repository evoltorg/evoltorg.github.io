<p>(get the book at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723107/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Amazon.com</a>, \n  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723107/" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Amazon.co.uk</a>, \n  <a href="http://www1.fatbrain.com/asp/bookInfo/bookinfo.asp?theisbn=0789723107" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">Fatbrain.com</a> \n  ) </p>\n<h2>Should you buy this?</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>If you're low on money and not a usability freak, just read <a href="http://www.circle.com/krugbook/chaptertwo.html" target="_foo" title="Opens in a new window">the \n    online chapter</a>. The rest isn't as good. </li>\n  <li>If you're ok on money, get it!</li>\n  <li>If you need to convince co-workers about usability (it's really good for \n    visual people), definitely get it.</li>\n  <li>If you're doubting between Jakob's book and this, get this and print out \n    Jakob's alertboxes. (his book is really just rehashing his alertboxes)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Now that we have the basics settled, what is so good about this book?</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>It really helps you take a <strong>fresh look</strong>, away from all the holy wars, \n    on how people <em>really</em> use the web.</li>\n  <li>It is <strong>funny</strong> and entertaining, which for a book on usability is a \n    Great Achievement.</li>\n  <li>Our <strong>visual</strong> guy (from a print background) really liked it.</li>\n  <li>I liked the first chapters better than the later ones, but they are all \n    worth reading.</li>\n</ul>
