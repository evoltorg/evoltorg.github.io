          <h2>Apple Under Fire For Sherlock 2 Ads</h2>

Sherlock 2, as outlined in Martin's article <a </p><p>href="http://evolt.org/article/Searching_with_Sherlock_Part_1_What_is_it/20/555/evolt.org">Searching with </p><p>Sherlock Part 1: What is it?</a> is a cool part of the MacOS which allows </p><p>users to search multiple sites from their computer. It doesn't reduce banner </p><p>ad revenue for sites providing plugins, because Sherlock plugins incorporate a </p><p>site's banners into the Sherlock results - or does it?</p><p>Well, yes and no. Yes if you're on Apple's small list of approved vendors, but  </p><p>not so if you're the owner of a smaller site.</p><p>Tests by MacWEEK and members of the Sherlock-Talk mailing list show that </p><p>Sherlock 2 will "override ad banners in third-party plug-ins outside of </p><p>Apple's built-in set", and instead will display Apple ads with each search.</p><p>This change is undocumented (the original Sherlock allowed third-party </p><p>developers to include advertising data in their plug-ins), and leaves only </p><p>Apple and its approved vendors to reap ad revenue from Sherlock 2.</p><p>Manager of the Sherlock-Talk mailing list, Michael Ginsberg, noted that "If </p><p>Apple does not allow plug-in developers to control the banner ads viewed in </p><p>Sherlock, the number of plug-ins written for Sherlock 2 will be greatly </p><p>reduced," Ginsberg said.</p><p>Webmaster of Freedom UK, Pete Shaw agreed, adding "The default search sites </p><p>get their own banners displayed, but sites that want to support Sherlock would </p><p>have to give up their only source of revenue, which seems like a great shame. </p><p>I love the whole concept of Sherlock and want to be able to offer Freedom UK </p><p>visitors the ability to search its resources outside the browser, but I can't </p><p>see how I can support Sherlock 2 if the ad revenue is being blocked."</p><p>After using Apple hardware for most of the work done on Freedom UK, Shaw says </p><p>he feels particularly cheated.</p><p>MacWEEK reports: "Apple was not immediately available for comment." If anyone </p><p>spots a response from the company, please add information in a comment.</p><p>In the meantime, for more information, see:</p><p><ul>\n<li>\n<a href="http://macweek.zdnet.com/1999/11/14/sherlock.html">MacWEEK: Does </p><p>Sherlock 2 play fair?</a>\n<li><a href="http://sherlock.mdg.com/sherlock-talk.html">Sherlock-Talk mailing </p><p>list</a>\n</ul></p><p>Please note that <b>evolt.org</b> will continue to work at providing an evolt </p><p>plug-in for Sherlock, since obviously we do not depend on advertising revenue </p><p>to survive. However, it would have been nice to include a small evolt banner </p><p>ad in results - to help promote other services (thelist, the free site source </p><p>code, archives, etc) to web developers not yet aware of these.
