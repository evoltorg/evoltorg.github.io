<p>Although the disciplines of Information Design, Information Architecture are \n  as old as the first human written documents and collections of them, they have \n  developed in a large scale these last years in the context of web development. \n</p>\n<p>Some people <a href="http://argus-acia.com/acia_event/morville_session.html" target="_foo">say</a> that after the era of information comes the era of the information \n  architects, responsible for organizing such overwhelming amounts of information \n  the web has allowed us to mobilize, recycle and create. And that this career \n  will divide into several levels of specialization. It makes sense to me, so i've also jumped on the IA train.</p>\n<p>The community of web developers hosted within this site has also felt and experienced \n  the growth of this field. Time and experience has shown us the relevance of \n  careful and deep work prior to the production stage in our projects. Some members \n  have expanded our interests into this area, some have strong backgrounds in \n  the field, others - like myself - have completely shifted their career towards \n  this blooming discipline that feels so unexplored and attractive. </p>\n<p>We already have <a href="http://www.evolt.org/topics/IA_Usability/4090/evolt.org\n" target="_new">some articles</a> that fit the subject, but now we've considered \n  it is the time to open a new <a href="http://www.evolt.org/topics/IA_Usability/4090/evolt.org\n" target="_new">"center"</a> to host them and invite the rest of the \n  IA/UE community to share their thoughts and research with our ever growing evolt.org. </p>
