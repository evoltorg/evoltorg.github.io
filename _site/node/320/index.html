          <h2>Austrian Labor Wants Europe To Ban Spam</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Aug 1999</p>

<div class="post">
Dear Colleagues, <P> In its implementation of the distance selling directive, the  Austrian parliament has passed a law prohibiting unsolicited  commercial e-mail and spamming. This ban requested by  Austrian consumer organizations, Internet user groups and  the Austrian ISP (Internet Service Providers) was ultimately  passed by all political parties. Commercial e-mail may now  be sent only with the recipient's express consent (revocable  at any time). <P> The Austrian regulation was required for the following  reasons: - The mass sending of unsolicited commercial e- mail (also known as "spamming") is one of the greatest  irritants on the Internet and tarnishes the reputation of  electronic commerce as a whole. - Unsolicited commercial e- mail clogs users' electronic mailboxes, increases loading  times, and incurs costs for users. - There are no effective  technical means by which to intercept and filter out  undesirable commercial e-mail. The "opt out" approach  always suggested is not only technically complicated and  difficult to administer, it poses certain data protection  problems as well. - Since the sending of unsolicited e-mail  badly damages a firm's image, reputable companies  abandoned this practice long ago. Many marketing experts  also warn against using this form of advertising. - Spam  typically contains pyramid games, pornography and sham  offers designed to entice customers. - According to  traditional Internet etiquette ("Netiquette") in place for many  years now, nonconsensual advertising by e-mail is not  permitted. <P> After Austria's and Italy's ban of unsolicited commercial e- mail, Germany has now also followed suit. It appears only  sensible and indeed necessary to take the next step and  implement this ban and, with it, the traditional "opt-in"  approach at the European level. <P> The Austrian Federal Chamber of Labor urges you to support  this initiative and to promote it with appropriate lobbying and  other suitable activities aimed at the national ruling  governments (in light of their votes in the European Council),  the European Commission and the members of the European  Parliament. Given the current European rules, the European  Council is the only body able to set new legal and political  accents in the next phase of these efforts. The Internet user  groups in Central Europe also plan to launch activities at the  European level. It should be noted that many smaller  businesses and free lancers are also very hard hit by the  problem of spamming. <P>  <P> ----------------<br>\n(Univ Doz Dr)  Karl Kollmann, Austrian Federal Chamber of Labour -  Consumer Policy Department, A-1040 Wien, Prinz Eugen Str  20-22, Tel. +43-1-50165-2307 Fax: +43-1-50165-2693 Mobile:  +436644537734 email at Vienna University of Economics:  kollmann@wu-wien.ac.at
