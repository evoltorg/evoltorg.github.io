<p>We have always heard about the imminent demise of URLs that are too difficult to write, save and keep in mind. Much research has not been done in this field. But the recent development in technology and the ever growing business is sure to take URLs to an advanced position. Dirty URLs are generally prone to hackers as the file extensions they use, disclose the fundamental technology and also expose the type of request that is being made. So, it is important to hide the architecture and still make it user friendly.</p></p><p><p>According to SEO Consultants, Dirty URLs are often inundated with various identifiers and characters that are immaterial to the ordinary users. They are generally lengthy and complex in their structures. The hackers try to modify them as Dirty URLs reveal valuable implementation details via the file extension of a dynamic web site. Security risks are obviously high and they do not support usability. Due to its exposed structure it is often difficult to change the technology. </p></p><p><p><strong>It may come to your mind as to why you should use dirty URLs?</strong></p></p><p><p>The have very less positive points.

Use identifiers that best describe the page.</li>\n<li><strong>Technology, not to be exposed</strong>: Uses of Directory names that unveil the technology of the server are discouraged. More nonspecific paths should be used.</li>\n<li><strong>Use lower case</strong>: All files and directory names should be written in lower case so as to avoid confusion. This may not be an easy task under Linux OR Unix systems, so it is essential to get the process correct in spite of its case related issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Do not use punctuation in file names</strong> : While designing an URL it is often noticed that underscores are used. This may be difficult for users to remember. For separate file names it is suggested to use hyphens instead of underscores.</li>\n<li><strong>Host and domain name typos</strong>: It is always seen that users in a hurry make mistakes while typing. There may be companies that are difficult to spell. So if the organizations find the typo domain names and add up a few entries, it will make the site more user friendly.  </li>\n<li><strong>Guessable URLs</strong>: It should be possible for the users to guess the URLs for a site entry. Mapping multiple URLs to a site may make the job fairly easy and increase the usability of the site.</li>\n</ul></p><p><h3>Synopsis of the Article</h3>\n<p>The look of an URL is in itself an important factor that can influence its users. Whatever may be the reasons behind an URL design, a webmaster should always consider it from the SEO point of view. Hopefully by taking care of the designing part of an URL we can make our web applications more SEO friendly. </p>
