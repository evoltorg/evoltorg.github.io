Running broadband connection can cause some further dilemmas, run a software firewall. I like Zonealarm by Zonelabs. They provide a free version. If you are fractional to Microsoft, then go ahead and exploit the one included with XP.</p><p>4. Study has shown Mozilla Firefox works better than Internet Explorer, Opera and Netscape when it is about scanning the internet viruses, run the Firefox web browser; it’s a lot better than Internet Explorer with some great features. And even if you like Explorer better, it doesn’t hurt to have two browsers at same time.</p><p>5. Defrag once every three months—sooner if you run anything moreover Windows 2000/XP.</p><p>6.

Viruses broadcast by infecting a PC and emailing themselves to everyone in the infected computer’s address book. Ponder a code word to exploit in the subject line of Emails. Your friends and family would know the particular keyword (maybe mango etc.) and would comprise this in the subject when attaching a file. A bad keyword may be Viagra.</p><p>2. Never provide your REAL email address when signing up for anything online until that site gets trusted through some sort of scan.
