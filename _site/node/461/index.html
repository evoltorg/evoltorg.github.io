<div class="post">
<a href="http://www.tripod.com">Tripod</a>, one of many free web-hosting companies, announced a new program today that will actually pay owners of homepages that generate a certain amount of hits per day.</p><p>The rates are $1.00 for every 1000 ad impressions your site serves, which is pretty slim to say the least; sure it could add up over time - at 5,000 impressions a day you're pulling in $1,800US a year so don't quit the day job yet. It sounds to me like they're giving you a small percentage of the money they're already making off the annoying banner ads that are served from your Web pages anyways.</p><p>Get all the gory details <a href="http://www.tripod.com/build/rewards/bucks.html">here</a>.\n
