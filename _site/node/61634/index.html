When talking about ‘the old times’ parents get nostalgic, and occasionally tearful. We get to hear from them about their friends and their idea of hanging out, why, even a pen pal or two with whom they used to stay in touch with through mail (not e-mail by the way). Why , even twenty years back, telephone was the only way to get through to someone if you wanted your message to reach the recipient within anywhere between two and five days, especially if that message has to travel half way across the earth. It has only taken a phase shift of twenty years to get that transit time to come down to two, three seconds at max. Welcome to the era of instant communication where keeping in touch is in. \nWith social networking growing the way it is, you find more and more people keeping in touch through web sites that offer this forum, sometimes going to the extreme where two people at work sitting in adjacent cubicles at work forward jokes over the internet. But all of this advancement is not as crazy as that. The previous generation has always complained about how unlike their lot that the current generation is. Social networking just re-emphasises that – this generation has managed to stay in touch with the people they met at school, college or at their first job, which our parents have not managed to do. Thumbs up to this generation!!! Social networking sites not only allow you to simply communicate with each other, but they allow you to share music, pictures, videos, files and just about anything digital under the sun. Imagine being able to play a game of backgammon with a Japanese man sitting in Germany using an American laptop on an English network. Now that’s getting connected. Powerful tool huh? \nOwning and running such a networking site must be very difficult and time consuming right? Wrong, availability of easy to use and commercially viable software has made owning a social networking site a breeze. The best part of the deal is that no technical knowledge is required to use such software and the user interface is as simple as can be. So get online, get yourself one of the easily available facebook clone software, get creating, and watch your money grow! </p><p>
