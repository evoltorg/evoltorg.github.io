<p>\nTo start, here is the basic list of allowed tags in comments and articles:\n</p></p><p><dl>\n <dd>&lt;a&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;p&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;blockquote&gt;,&lt;/blockquote&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;ul&gt;,&lt;/ul&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;ol&gt;,&lt;/ol&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;li&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;dl&gt;,&lt;/dl&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;dd&gt;,&lt;/dd&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;dt&gt;,&lt;/dt&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;pre&gt;,&lt;/pre&gt; (which get converted to a textarea)</dd>\n <dd>&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;cite&gt;,&lt;/cite&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;br&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;img&gt;</dd>\n <dd>&lt;hr&gt;</dd>\n</dl></p><p><p>\n<strong>Can you give us a brief overview of what you've done?</strong>\n</p></p><p><p>\nTo answer your question, I'm using a big black box with a variable\nspeed motor attached to an alternating beater arm.  Each tag is spun around\nwithin this black box by this beater arm inside a metal colander with small\nholes of varying sizes.  Those tags not marked as safe have holes of\nappropriate size that can be found in this colander.  Those marked as safe\ndo not have such holes.  As they're spun around, centripetal force pulls\nthem out through the hole sized appropriately for the given tag.  What's\nleft is then poured out into a baking tin sprayed with 3 in 1 oil, baked at\n12,000 degrees kelvin for 3.4 nanoseconds and promptly stored in the database to\ncool.  Serve chilled, neat, warm, or hellfire.  Serves an unlimited number\nand never spoils.\n</p></p><p><p>\n<strong>Wouldn't a teflon coated ceramic work better and resist corrosion?</strong>\n</p></p><p><p>\nI experimented with teflon and ceramic, both together and separately.  I\nabandoned them both for separate reasons.\n</p></p><p><p>\nI found that the sharp ends of the tags would scratch nearly all the teflon\ncoating off the colander after only one run.  This resulted in excessive\nlong term memory loss in those the final product was served to, hence the\ntemporary increase of same subject questions on thelist in a relatively\nshort period of time.\n</p></p><p><p>\nIn my experiments I found that the initial torque requirements necessary to\nbring the colander up to speed was causing undue stress on the motor due to\nits weight.  The advantage of inertia at that point would have warranted\nkeeping it if it hadn't been so expensive, not to mention there wasn't\nenough room in the current design of the black box, to install a set of\ncounter-action, retro-motion brakes.  without them the colander would come\nup to speed, spin out the mash in milliseconds and continue to spin for\nhours.  This resulted in unnecessary spilling when attempting to feed the\nnext string to process.  We were losing data bits from unpredictable spots\nin strings until we figured that one out.  Some of the secrets of the\nuniverse will never be recovered because of that mistake.\n</p></p><p><p>\n<strong>What's the leverage ratio of the arm?</strong>\n</p></p><p><p>\nIt's actually a variable ratio leverage arm achieved by a parallel coupling\nbetween the motor drive arm and the fixed arm on the beater.  Depending on\nthe thickness of the string, the arm can adjust its pitch to match.\n</p></p><p><p>\nYou have no idea how much rethinking we had to do just to test this thing.\nWe had to throw all of our testing methodology out the window.\n</p></p><p><p>\n<strong>Are you using needle bearings or cartridge?</strong>\n</p></p><p><p>\nIt's actually using something called a polymorphal-floatfit.  maybe i'll\nwrite an article about that actually.  It's pretty complex.\n</p></p><p><p>\n<strong>I would think there would be some concern with the possible under-torque in high-content filtering</strong>\n</p></p><p><p>\nFortunately, this device is nothing more than an object that can be\ninstantiated for any number of requests.  we even recently fitted it with an\nattachment that would take care of its own cleanup and storage.  All you\nhave to do is install it and it does everything else automatically.\nUnfortunately we forgot an off switch and it can be pretty protective.  So,\nnow that it's installed we're basically stuck with it.\n</p></p><p><p>\n<strong>Thanks for taking the time to speak with us.</strong>\n</p></p><p><p>\nSure.  Can I go now?\n</p>
