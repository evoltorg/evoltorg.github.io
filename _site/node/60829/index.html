<a href="http://www.ipfonline.com/">Industrial Products Finder </a>was visualized and conjunction as an industrial new-industrial products-news monthly by R.V. Pandit, and was launched as such in October 1972. Right from the first issue, more than 34 years ago, the journal contained unique features. It showcased exactly what the name of the journal proclaimed: Industrial Products Finder. It carries only advertisements and article on industrial products, which is awaited news in industry and online circles. </p><p>The magazine, being industry-centric in nature, is made available only through prepaid annual (1-year and 3-year, and 5-year) subscriptions to businesses, industries and technical/managerial personnel, so as to avoid wastage. </p><p>Yet, there have been dramatic changes. Over the years, the journal has grown in size and reach. It is so popular that it is simply known as IPF in industrial circles. It is so useful to readers that anybody in industry who gets to examine it becomes its subscriber. As a standing testimony to its reputation, thousands of subscribers who initially subscribed to the early issues of IPF from 1972 are still its subscribers even today.
