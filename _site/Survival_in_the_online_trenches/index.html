<div class="post">
<p>The Internet is an amazing thing - as a media it was and is a\nrevolution. Everybody can participate, publishing and amending content is a \nmatter of seconds and a lot of it is free. Let's take part, shall we?</p>\n<p>Fame, fortune and great feedback await us, so let's put our work out there \nfor people to find and enjoy.</p>\n<p>Alas, it seems as soon as you publish something and allow people to comment on it \nor use it, you're in for a rude awakening.</p>\n<p>Stay with us and hear a tale of the foes we have on the web. All of the upcoming\ncharacters are purely non-fictional.</p></p><p><h2>Meet the army of spoilers</h2></p><p><h3>The professional spammer</h3>\n<p>His job is to find emails to send important things - like penis enhancement \nproducts or drugs you cannot get that cheap in the pharmacy - to them.</p> \n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n<p>There is not much of a remedy against the spammer. As soon as your email is \nreadable somewhere and in the source of the page, it can and will be \nharvested by spam robots and you are in for a filled inbox. There are many \nideas as to how to stop that - obfuscating the email via Javascript, or adding \nit as an image. These are effective to some degree, but could challenge usability \nor accessibility. A rather spam-free way to allow people to contact \nyou is an email form. Keep the email addresses in a database and simply \nreference them by key. In any case, a spam filter on your mailbox is in order.</p></p><p><h3>The clumsy spammer</h3>\n<p>Links make the web work. Links also make Google recognise and rank our pages. \nThat is why some people tend to sneak in links pointing to their web sites into comments \nby turning random words and punctuation into links. It may or may not be that Google does \nfollow links that have a dash or a full stop as their textual content, in any \ncase it is a clumsy and rather pathetic try to raise awareness for your web site.</p>\n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n<p>Either disallow links, or display them as full text. That way the comments \nwill be named and shamed and you can see the spamming immediately and remove the links \nor the full comment.</p></p><p><h3>The hacker</h3>\n<p>Religious debates about Unix vs. FreeBSD vs. Windows aside - your server is \nconstantly open to attacks by hackers or hacker wannabees. The argument &#34;but \nthe stuff I publish is free and I am not an evil corporation&#34; doesn't work any \nlonger. A server is a server and if I can hack my way into it, I can use it as \nan online hard disk to store data on.</p>\n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n<p>Don't do the server maintenance, if you don't know what you are doing. Make \nsure to use complex passwords and change them regularly. If you install scripts \nand extensions on your server, follow the instructions and do not leave scripts \nwith names like &#34;admin&#34; unprotected. If the script allows it, rename them, or \nsecure them with a password via .htaccess or equivalents.</p></p><p><h3>The citizen of me-oh-me-ia</h3>\n<p>This dysfunctional breed is prone to fill comment facilities with off-topic \nmessages pointing in their direction, an example would be: &#34;Wow, cool \narticle about accessible navigations. I think <a href="/Survival_in_the_online_trenches#" title="an example link leading nowhere">my \nweb site about making little furry animals from dental floss</a> could need it&#34;.</q>\n<p>Furthermore, the citizens of me-oh-me-ia also have the perception that their \nsetup is the world's: &#34;Your script works fine on all common browsers, but my \nbrowser XYZ does not support it. Therefore it is useless&#34;.</p>\n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n<p>This type is more annoying than really destructive. Therefore you can either\njust counterargument in the comments, or, in case of serial offenders, delete\nthem. People like these keep us from really improving our sites and adding new \ncontent, as we have to spend all that time on maintenance.</p></p><p><h3>The &#34;My help request right or wrong&#34; user</h3>\n<p>This type has the impression that you are either all-knowing, or that you do \nhave the inclination and time to help out no matter how unrelated the request is.\n&#34;I have seen your PHP script, and I like it, how can I set up a server to \nrun it?&#34; or &#34;I see you publish a lot of articles, can you tell me what \nlaptop is the best&#34; are typical examples. They most likely don't mean to be \nannoying, they just think you like helping people, and you do, but surely not with \neverything.</p>\n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n<p>As stated above, this behaviour can be due to not knowing better and misreading \nyour nice texts as a &#34;come on all, I'll sort you out&#34;. Therefore punishing \nis not really a good response. Better point them to example pages. For more on \nthis, read &#34;<a href="http://www.evolt.org/helponline">How to help and get help online</a>&#34;. \nTry to be nice, breathe in and out 10 times before answering something like \n&#34;Have you tried this very secret web site called Google&#34; or &#34;RTFM&#34;.</p></p><p><h3>The bad implementer</h3>\n<p>If you publish scripts and you thought you made them idiot proof, rest assured \nthat someone will come up with a better idiot. Either your documentation is bad,\nor just too extensive. A good documentation does not help, as, sad but true, \npeople do not read them. That is why you end up with people using your scripts,\nfailing to secure them properly and come complaining to you about &#34;being hacked&#34;.</p>\n<p>You can even point out 10 times that you made a template and a user does not \nneed to know language XYZ to re-skin it, you'll still get people telling you \nthat they can't use it as they don't know XYZ.</p>\n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n<p>Again, a user that you don't want to annoy too much. They are not evil, they \nare misled (or lazy). Point out the documentation again, if inclined, help them \nhands-on. Write your documentation concise and short (Step by Step examples proved\nto be helpful) and make your scripts check if they are insecure (is the file \nstill called admin? Can it be written to?).</p></p><p><h3>Dr. Test and Mr. Hello</h3>\n<p>This dynamic duo is always on the hunt for innocent form fields, like sign-up \nfields for newsletters, guestbooks or even contact forms, just to fill them \nwith &#34;test&#34; or &#34;hello&#34; and send them off. There is no name for \nthis fetish yet, but it seems to give them a lot of pleasure.</p>\n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n<p>Simply make sure you review the guestbook entries before they get published, \ncheck fields for the words above and don't submit them when that is their only \ncontent.</p></p><p><h3>The all-knowing developer</h3>\n<p>This kind will comment on anything you do with a confident &#34;I have done \nthat years ago&#34; and accuse you of being inefficient if you don't apply \ntechnique XYZ to the problem ABC. He will also claim having had the idea years \nbefore and didn't &#34;feel like writing about it&34;</p>\n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n<p>Point out that an example is an example and that there are many ways to \nachieve the same goal. Also point out that less optimised examples may be \nnecessary to explain certain techniques. Congratulate them on their greatness and \ntell them to start writing themselves. They'll soon realise it is not as easy as\ncreating a perfect code solution.</p></p><p><h3>Trolls</h3>\n<p>The worst of the web. Trolls are people that post only to annoy and attack \nothers. They offend for the sake of offending and are very likely to cause long-winded,\noff-topic discussions if their baits were successful.</p>\n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n<p>Delete posts, block if possible. Keep the lid on the jar of trollnip and call\nHarry Potter.</p></p><p><h2>"Fame's a fickle friend, Harry"</h2>\n<p>The more success your site has, or the more you publish, the more likely it is \nthat you will encounter one or more of the above. It seems as if free speech is \na nice enough concept, but only a chosen few know how to use it wisely, whereas \nthe people abusing it are legion. The reasons might be of various nature: envy, \nboredom, unhappy childhood, inability to communicate in real life - you name it.</p>\n<p>You end up using your time maintaining the comments and the contacts you get,\nand doing less and less for the site, unless you are lucky enough to be able to \ndelegate that job.</p>\n<p>Why we do it despite of all these issues? Because we can, and because we have \nto, to keep this wonderful new media alive.</p> \n<p>Every comment and mail needs to be checked and tended to, so next time you \nfeel the urge to write something about an online text you saw, think of the \nconsequences, and try not to fall into any of the above categories.</p>
