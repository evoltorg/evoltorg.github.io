<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://evolt.org/help_support_evolt/">Help Support \n  evolt.org</a> and via email on <a href="http://lists.evolt.org/index.cfm/a/listinfo">thelist</a>, \n  a new supporter has stepped forward to help evolt.org.</p></p><p><p>When an evolt.org member \n  chooses to host through NetWorth's affiliate hosting program, the hosting company \n  donates 10% to evolt.org. </p></p><p><p>The information that follows describes how evolt.org and NetWorth Enterprises \n  are affiliated, and provides more details about the hosting features.</p></p><p><p>For many years, <a href="http://www.nweinc.net/">NetWorth Enterprises, Inc.</a> \n  has provided consulting and custom software to the mortgage banking industry, \n  mostly for the top 10 mortgage companies. NetWorth enjoys a very good reputation \n  in that industry, and began moving into Internet services 2-3 years ago.</p></p><p><p>Ron Dorman&#8212;a founding member of evolt.org&#8212;is the brother of NetWorth's \n  founder. NetWorth is a re-seller for Ron's company, <a href="http://csi1st.net/">Computer \n  Solutions &amp; Insights, Inc.</a> (CSI). CSI initially hosted evolt.org's mailing lists\n  and now has taken over hosting and servicing of all our sites. The sites and \n  listservs are running from the same data center where the affiliate hosting \n  is provided.</p></p><p><p>CSI will be managing, supporting and servicing any hosting resulting from NetWorth's \n  affiliate program (through their domain, <a href="http://ez-profits.com/">ez-profits.com</a>). \n  Ron will be very involved in providing excellent service.</p>\n<p>When affiliate hosting programs were mentioned during evolt.org's fund-raising \n  discussions, Ron explained the idea and evolt.org's mission to his brother Randy \n  at NetWorth. Impressed by evolt.org, NetWorth offered to provide the affiliate \n  program, build the site to support on-line sign-ups and get things in place \n  to provide funding for evolt.org.</p>\n<p>NetWorth is providing the affiliate program under the domain &quot;<a href="http://ez-profits.com/">ez-profits.com</a>,&quot; \n  but will eventually change the name (it will take a little time to get the security \n  certificates reassigned to a different domain).</p></p><p><p>If you're interested in the affiliate hosting program, NetWorth and\nCSI have built servers for Linux hosting with:</p></p><p><ul>\n  <li>CPanel web based site management software to allow each site secure management \n    capability for name based and/or IP based hosting</li>\n  <li>email account management, forwarding, filtering, lists, and spamassassin</li>\n  <li>stats (3 packages available, capable of adding more on customer request)</li>\n  <li>sub-domain and parked domain support</li>\n  <li>web based file manager</li>\n  <li>web based management of file and directory access privileges</li>\n  <li>raw access log download</li>\n  <li>mysql database support with phpmyadmin</li>\n  <li>domain cron job set up and maintenance</li>\n  <li>3 shopping carts (Interchange and Agora - control panel install, phpShop \n    - support staff install)</li>\n  <li>FrontPage 5 extensions</li>\n  <li>and several other site support features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They do not have any web based site management on Windows servers yet, but \n  can host on Win 2000 servers.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href="http://ez-profits.com/">ez-profits.com</a>. \n</p>
