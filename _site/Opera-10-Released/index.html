          <h2>Opera 10 Released</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Opera 10, the web browser of the niche user, has been released (on schedule, September 1). Among the new features is something called Turbo, which "uses compression technology that provides significant improvements in browsing speeds over limited-bandwidth connections." I guess this means I should try it at the cafe on those weekend mornings when the regulars are downloading multi-gig videos.</p><p>Opera supposedly has a new look and sleeker interface. If I can get it installed today I'll update this post.</p><p>The part that interests me most, their claim of a "40% faster engine and cutting-edge Web standards support."</p><blockquote>We optimized the new Opera Presto 2.2 engine in Opera 10 to be much faster on resource-intensive pages such as Gmail and Facebook. In addition, with an Acid3 100/100 score, Web Fonts support, RGBA/HSLA color and SVG improvements, Opera 10 is ready for the next generation of Web applications.</blockquote><p><a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">Download it at Opera.com</a>.</p>
