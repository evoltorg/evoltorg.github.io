<p>\n	All web sites associated with the federal government (and an increasing number \n	of states) will need to comply with the <strong>Americans With Disabilities \n	Act</strong> by early next year. This will affect web publications, software \n	development, and hardware and software procurement standards.\n</p> \n<h2>CONTENTS:</h2>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<a href="/Accessibility:_more_than_the_right_thing_to_do#issue">The issue \n		at hand</a>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="/Accessibility:_more_than_the_right_thing_to_do#law">What \n		the law means for you</a>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="/Accessibility:_more_than_the_right_thing_to_do#overview">Overview \n		of accessibility features for web sites</a>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n		To accommodate the <a href="/Accessibility:_more_than_the_right_thing_to_do#blind">visually \n		impaired or blind</a>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n		To accommodate the \n		<a href="/Accessibility:_more_than_the_right_thing_to_do#hearing">hearing \n		impaired or deaf</a>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n		To accommodate those <a href="motor">with motor impairments</a>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n		<a href="/Accessibility:_more_than_the_right_thing_to_do#resources">Further resources</a>\n	</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	<strong><a name="issue"></a>THE ISSUE AT HAND</strong><br>I recently attended a \n	web accessibility seminar, and it confirmed some issues that have been discussed \n	in recent months throughout the web development commmunity: new U.S. Federal \n	and State laws affecting web sites. While you may not be running a site supported \n	by federal or state funding, it might be beneficial to make accessibility \n	adjustments to your site just the same.\n</p> \n<p>\n	According to the seminar, federal web sites (and their contractors) must adhere \n	to the federal law by February 2000. State laws, in some cases, are already supposed \n	to be in effect, but this varies. For example, in the case of Maryland the law was \n	supposed to go into effect as of October 1998, but the information is only now \n	(almost a year later) being widely disseminated.\n</p> \n<p>\n	<strong><a name="law"></a>WHAT THE NEW LAWS MAY MEAN FOR YOU</strong><br>\n	Affected web site managers and developers must take into account the steps below \n	to rectify possible problems on their web sites. For most of you (I hope), \n	these steps mean minor tweaks to your sites; for others it may mean significant \n	site overhaul or redesign.\n</p> \n<p>\n	<strong>The features listed below are not optional.</strong> If you have been \n	previously unaware of accessibility issues and failed to take these principles \n	into account, you will now have to make an additional effort to adopt the \n	good design practices described below. According to the information presented \n	at the seminar, if you have a public web site associated with Federal or \n	State government (including state-funded colleges and universities), you are \n	required to adhere to these guidelines. This includes faculty pages meant \n	to disseminate information for students and resources for the public, but does \n	not include &quot;personal&quot; web pages (though these guidelines encourage good design practices in general).\n</p> \n<p>\n	Please begin checking and modifying your site soon, as the six months will pass by quickly.\n</p> \n<h2>\n	<a name="overview"></a>OVERVIEW OF ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES FOR WEB SITES\n</h2> \n<p>\n	 <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" > \n	<tr> \n		<td>\n			<strong>General Techniques</strong>\n		&nbsp;</td>\n		<td align="center">\n			<small><strong>Checked</strong></small>\n		&nbsp;</td>\n		<td align="center">\n			<small><strong>Fixed</strong></small>\n		&nbsp;</td> \n	</tr> \n	<tr> \n		<td>\n			<p>\n				<strong>Judicious use of colors, fonts, and graphics.</strong><br>\n				Restraint is the key word. A web page can, in many ways, be likened \n				to a page in a book. As a general rule:\n			</p>\n			<ol> \n				<li>\n					Avoid the use of <em>more</em> than two or three colors (plus white) and three font sizes.\n				</li> \n				<li>\n					Use bold and italic sparingly (for titles and occasional emphasis), \n					and <em>avoid</em> underlining plain text (people often mistake \n					underlined plain text as a link).\n				</li>\n				<li>\n					As far as colors go, keep in mind that 8-12% of the population is color blind.\n				</li>\n				<li>\n					The most common form of color blindness is Red-Green, where the colors \n					red and green can appear as a shade of brown. Placing red text on green, \n					or vice versa, may yield an unreadable web page for roughly 10% of your visitors.\n				</li> \n				<li>\n					Similar problems may occur when using red, green, and brown in graphics \n					(pie charts, graphs, maps, etc). Instead, consider using textures and \n					fill patterns. Otherwise, use colors with a good measure of contrast \n					(light tones vs. dark tones).\n				</li> \n				<li>\n					Try to minimize your use of textured backgrounds. If you must use them, \n					make sure they are very low contrast. Be especially careful when choosing \n					font and link colors on a colored background.\n				</li> \n				<li>\n					Also, avoid animated gifs (or have them loop only once or twice). They \n					are distracting when trying to read text on a page, and for some people \n					with certain learning disabilities animated gifs may be very difficult \n					to ignore.\n				</li> \n			</ol>\n		&nbsp;</td> \n		<td>\n			 \n		&nbsp;</td> \n		<td>\n			 \n		&nbsp;</td> \n	</tr> \n	<tr> \n		<td>\n			\n			<p>\n				<strong>Consistent layout.</strong>\n			</p>\n			<ol>\n				<li>\n					Determine a common layout for your all of your web \n					pages, and stick to it. This greatly assists visitors in \n					navigating your web pages, and for some may determine their \n					ability to understand the organization of your pages.\n				</li> \n				<li>\n					Placement of the title, logo, navigation and content should \n					be consistent from page to page.\n				</li> \n				<li>\n					Navigational links should be placed within the first &quot;screen&quot; \n					the viewer encounters on any given page (they shouldn't have to scroll \n					to find the links).\n				</li>\n			</ol> \n			</p>\n		&nbsp;</td> \n		<td>\n			 \n		&nbsp;</td> \n		<td>\n			 \n		&nbsp;</td> \n	</tr> \n	<tr> \n		<td>\n			<p>\n				<strong>&quot;No Frames&quot; compatibility.</strong><br> \n				There are two options for those of you with web pages using \n				&quot;frames&quot; (if you don't know what &quot;frames&quot; \n				means, it's probably not you).\n			</p>\n			<ol> \n				<li>\n					Maintain a text-only or non-frame version of your web site in \n					parallel with your framed version. <strong>The text-only/non-frame \n					version must be kept as up-to-date as the framed version.</strong> \n					This basically means maintaining two versions of your web site.\n				</li>\n				<li> --OR-- \n				</li>\n				<li>\n					Redesign your site so that it doesn't use frames.\n					\n				</li>\n			</ol>\n			<p>\n				In essence, you need to weigh creating and maintaining an up-to-date \n				parallel non-frames (or text only) site vs. doing a site redesign. \n			</p>\n		&nbsp;</td> \n		<td>\n			 \n		&nbsp;</td> \n		<td>\n			 \n		&nbsp;</td> \n	</tr> \n	<tr> \n		<td>\n			<h3>\n				Viewable with ANY browser\n			</h3>\n				 <ol> \n				<li>\n					Use evaluation tools and text-only browsers to verify accessibility.\n				</li>\n				<li>\n					Your site needs to work with all types of browsers, including text-only \n					browsers like Lynx, and screen-reader technology (for the visually \n					impaired). Lynx gives you a good (though not perfect) approximation of \n					how some of the new technology for the disabled &quot;reads&quot; \n					or represents a web page.\n				</li>\n				<li>\n					Another option is to find out if there is an accessibility lab on \n					a nearby campus which may be used to test your web pages.\n				</li>\n				<li>\n					It is also good idea to download a version of Lynx \n					(or telnet to the campus version - just type &quot;lynx&quot; \n					at the telnet prompt), and view your web pages through it to \n					see how they appear. Lynx is not the most intuitive program for those \n					of us used to Netscape and Internet Explorer, but it's a basic \n					piece of software, and the instructions at the bottom of \n					the page are simple and clear. If you don't use telnet, you \n					can download (free) a PC version of Lynx from \n					<a href="http://lynx.browser.org/" target="_new" \n					title="Lynx Browser.

If you're using a WYSIWYG \n					editor, you should be able to enter &quot;alt&quot; descriptions by \n					double clicking on a web page image, and entering alternative text \n					in the text field.\n				</li>\n				<li>\n					<strong>Links:</strong> when creating links, don't link a \n					whole sentence. Link only a couple of key words or a short phrase. \n					Reading a sentence (or several sentences) of bold, underlined, \n					colored text can be tiring for even the best vision.\n				</li>\n				<li>\n					<strong>Graphs, charts, maps:</strong> if a graph, chart, \n					or map is integral to your message or content, include a link to \n					a separate page holding a text description of the information presented \n					in the graphic. This is true of other important images as well.\n				</li>\n				<li>\n					<strong>Tables:</strong> tables can be tricky.
