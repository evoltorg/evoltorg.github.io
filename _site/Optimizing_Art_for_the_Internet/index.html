Artwork and photographs probably contribute the most to \n  this particular problem. Studies have shown that a page must load in 20 seconds \n  or less, or the visitor gets bored and goes elsewhere, probably never to return. \n  This issue is especially critical for visitors with low end modems - and unfortunately \n  there are plenty of such modems still in use.<br>\n  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p>\n<p><strong><a name="basics"></a>Optimizing Artwork, Important Basics:</strong> </p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Always save the original image separately for the inevitable later modification. \n  </li>\n  <li> Start your images in the RGB format (Red Green Blue, as opposed to CMYK). \n    [RGB is the default setting of many image programs.]</li>\n  <li> Convert images at the last minute to JPEG (JPG) or GIF.</li>\n  <li> JPEG - best file type for photographs.</li>\n  <li> GIF - best file type for flat color art.<br>\n    [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </li>\n</ol>\n<strong><a name="scale"></a>Design your images TO SCALE if at all possible</strong>, so \nyou don't get any surprises when you later reduce the image's dimensions. This \nis especially important when you're incorporating text in your images. Reducing \nimage dimensions after-the-fact may yield unreadable text. In the very least, \nthe final images should be to scale. Having to stretch or shrink them when creating \nweb pages can result in ugly images or unnecessarily large file sizes (and longer \ndownload times). <br>\n[back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] \n<p><strong><a name="72dpi"></a>All web images should be 72 dpi, period.</strong><br>\n  (The ONLY exception is when you need to put images up deliberately for download \n  by your users, and your users must have high resolution pictures accessible \n  through the web. This is a rare instance, and it involves making your users \n  wait obnoxious amounts of time just to view the image, and further obscene amounts \n  of time to download the image. Bottom line: Find another way to provide high-res \n  images to your users.)<br>\n  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p>\n<p><strong><a name="preferences"></a>Setting preferences properly in Photoshop </strong><i>(PS \n  only)</i><strong>:</strong> When designing web images in Photoshop 4(+), change the following \n  setting in your preferences... </p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Under File: Preferences: Saving Files, set Image Previews to "Never Save", \n    or at least to "Ask When Saving." </li>\n  <li> Then when saving your web image, DO NOT save an Icon, Thumbnail, or Full \n    Size Image Preview. </li>\n  <li>In Photoshop 5(+), Under File: Color Settings: RGB Setup, select anything \n    but &quot;sRGB&quot; - whatever else is appropriate (I chose &quot;monitor&quot;).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The RGB setting of &quot;sRGB&quot; is an advanced color setting. Using it \n  when creating web graphics will shift the color of your images - something you \n  want to avoid! Additionally, saving an image preview merely adds "weight" to \n  the file size, which inflates the image file size estimate. This information \n  is stripped off when a web page accesses the file anyway, and it's more important \n  to get an accurate file size than it is to see a preview of the image. And speaking \n  of file size estimates... <br>\n  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p>\n<p><strong><a name="accurate"></a>Getting an accurate measurement of image file size \n  (for estimating total web page size):</strong><br>\n  You want to know the image file sizes because you want to know how long your \n  web page will take to download.<br>\n<br><strong>On a PC:</strong> Right click ONCE on the file. Select &quot;Properties&quot; \n  from the menu that appears. The size is listed in the window that appears.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>On a Macintosh:</strong> Select the file (click on it ONCE) and under \n  the "File" menu, select "Get Info". In the window that appears is "Size:" and \n  two numbers. The number in the parentheses is the accurate file size (which \n  can vary widely from the "on disk" number). If you ever want to bother me about \n  the reason for the difference, go ahead, but it won't be pretty. <br>\n  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p>\n<p><strong><a name="accurateps"></a>Accurate measurement of image file size and Photoshop \n  </strong><i>(PS only)</i><strong>:</strong> The file size will be accurate for a Photoshop \n  created image IF you've set the Photoshop preferences the way I suggested earlier. \n  Otherwise, the file size includes preview data, and is inaccurate for web file \n  size estimation. <br>\n  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p>\n<p><strong><a name="shadows"></a>Don't use drop shadows and gradations on your artwork.<br>\n  </strong>Both tend to look ugly on low-end monitors at 256 colors, the standard settings \n  of most computers out of the box.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> \n    <p>Try to avoid drop shadows, especially ones with large shadow diffusions. \n      When they are necessary, keep the drop shadows small (1 or 2 pixels out), \n      and either don't blur the edge or blur just a tiny bit. <br>\n      <br>\n      Creating text or images with drop shadows that will be floating over a colored \n      webpage background are another special case altogether. Have you ever seen \n      an image with an unattractive white &quot;halo&quot; around it? That's because \n      the image was made on a white background, then the background was made transparent, \n      and finally placed on a colored page. In the process the &quot;edge&quot; \n      of the image picked up some &quot;white influenced&quot; pixels around it, \n      hence the halo.<br>\n      <br>\n      If you've got shadows you intend to float over a color, make the image with \n      the target color in the background. You can then make the background transparent \n      as you produce the gif, and the shadow will look more natural.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>Gradations are a big no-no on the web, particularly subtle ones. They band \n    like crazy on low-res screens and look REALLY ugly. Avoid them if at all possible. \n    <br>\n    [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><a name="jpeggif"></a>The general rule regarding JPEG vs. GIF is this:</strong> \n</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Use JPEGs for photo-like images with lots of colors and subtle color shifts \n    (like gradations).</li>\n  <li> Use GIFs for flat color images and line art. In most cases this will result \n    in better looking images with smaller file sizes (but for really small photo-like \n    images, use GIF instead of JPEG).<br>\n    [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><a name="palette"></a>The web-safe color palette:</strong> When designing flat \n  color art, start with the web palette! This palette contains the web safe 216 \n  colors which work on both PC's and Mac's. You'll want to use it because if you're \n  designing flat color art and don't choose a web-safe color, the art may &quot;dither&quot; \n  (get a spotty blend of colors) and look very different from what you intended. \n  Very important, and useful for avoiding headaches later. </p>\n<p>If you need the web safe palette (some programs have it already), you can get \n  it various places (try &quot;bclut2.aco&quot; at <a href="http://www.lynda.com/files/" target="_new" title="Opens new window">www.lynda.com</a>). \n  Another good palette resource is <a href="http://admin.evolt.org/marlene/services/netscape-216/" target="_new" title="Opens new window">here</a>. \n  It gives you the RGB and Hex values for any web safe color you choose.<br>\n  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p>\n<p><strong><a name="smallgif"></a>Getting the smallest GIF file size </strong><i>(PS only)</i><strong>:</strong> \n  If you're using photoshop, this is an important quick trick to get the smallest \n  GIF file size (reducing it to the smallest palette):</p>\n<ol>\n  <li> Start with RGB.</li>\n  <li> Under Image:Mode change the mode to Indexed Color.</li>\n  <li> In the window that appears, select the Web palette (216 colors).</li>\n  <li> Under Image:Mode change the mode back to RGB.</li>\n  <li> Again, under Image:Mode change the mode to Indexed Color.</li>\n  <li> In the window that appears, select the Exact palette.</li>\n  <li> Under File: Export choose GIF89a. </li>\n  <li> Choose Save (or Okay, or whatever it says). <br>\n    [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><a name="transparent"></a>Transparent GIF's </strong><i>(PS only, but other software \n  may be similar)</i><strong>:</strong> If you want to create a transparent color in the \n  GIF, use the eyedropper tool in the GIF89a window to select ONE target transparent \n  color before saving. Also, if you want to batch process a bunch of GIFs with \n  the same colors, create an "action" to do most of it for you. I won't get into \n  actions here (look at Photoshop help or your manual), but this can be a tremendous \n  time saver when processing a large number (or even a small number) of images \n  from RGB to GIF. <br>\n  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>] </p>\n<p><strong><a name="smalljpeg"></a>Getting the smallest JPEG file size: </strong>When saving \n  JPEGs, choose 1, 2 or 3 (or &quot;low&quot;) as your compression quality. Keeping \n  the compression low <strong>slightly</strong> erodes the quality of your images, but also \n  greatly saves in file size. Two or three "k" (kilobytes) can make a big difference! \n  Start saving your images at the lowest quality and work up from there, until \n  something looks good enough for you. </p>\n<p>If you're given either of the following options, follow the recommended instruction: \n  turn off "save paths" and choose "baseline standard." "Baseline Progressive" \n  creates JPEGs that are interlaced like GIFs, but not all major browsers support \n  progressive JPEGs. <br>\n  [back to <a href="/Optimizing_Art_for_the_Internet#contents">contents</a>]</p>\n<p><strong>Well, that's it for now.
