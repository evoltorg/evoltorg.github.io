<p>When you're working commercially, being great at what you do is about 25%\nof the task.  Too many times I see the sad example of someone walking in to a situation with\nnoble intentions and then getting royally screwed, because what they\nsee as an opportunity and a labor of love, the other party sees as something\nelse entirely, not at all romantic or idealized, but raw and simple.\n</p></p><p><p>You are going to be dealing with people who are unlike yourself. Their\nmotivations are their own and their attitudes are probably different\nthan yours. When you're in education, you may have tough teachers\nand think that it can't be worse, but wait until a business person has\na hundred grand riding on your work! Then you will know what <q>demanding</q> means.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis list wasn't meant to make anyone crazy or paranoid, but is\ndesigned to inject some reality into the fantasy.\n</p></p><p><h2>1. <q>Do this one cheap (or free) and we'll make it up on the next\none.</q></h2></p><p><p>No reputable business person would first give away their work and time\nor merchandise on the hope of making it up later. Can you imagine what\na plumber would say if you said <q>come in, provide and install the\nsink for free and next time we'll make it up when we need a sink.</q> You\nwould be laughed at! Also the likelyhood is that if something important\ncame along, they wouldn't use you.</p></p><p><h2>2. <q>We never pay a cent until we see the final product.</q></h2></p><p><p>This is a croc, unless the person is leaving the door open to cheat\nyou out of your pay. Virtually every profession requres a deposit or\nincremental payment during anything but the smallest project. Once you\nhave a working relationship, you may work out another arrangement with\na client. But a new client should not ask you to go beyond an initial\nmeeting and, perhaps some preliminary sketches without pay on the job.\n</p></p><p><h2>3. <q>Do this for us and you'll get great exposure! The jobs will\njust pour in!</q></h2></p><p><p>Baloney. Tell a plumber <q>Install this sink and my friend will see\nand you'll get lots of business!</q> Our plumber friend would say <q>You\nmean even if I do a good job I have to give my work away to get noticed?\nThen it isn't worth the notice.</q> Also the guy would likely brag\nto everyone he knows about how this would normally cost (X) dollars,\nbut brilliant businessman that he is he got if for free! If anyone calls,\nthey'll expect the same or better deal.\n</p></p><p><h2>4. On looking at sketches or concepts: <q>Well, we aren't sure if\nwe want to use you yet, but leave your material here so I can talk to\nmy partner/investor/wife/clergy.</q></h2></p><p><p>You can be sure that 15 minutes after you leave he will be on the phone\nto other designers, now with concepts in hand, asking for price quotes.\nWhen you call back you will be informed that your prices were too high\nand Joe Blow Design/Illustration will be doing the job. Why shouldn't\nthey be cheaper? You just gave them hours of free consulting work! Until\nyou have a deal, <strong>leave nothing creative</strong> at the clients office.</p></p><p><h2>5. <q>Well, the job isn't <em>CANCELLED</em>, just delayed. Keep the account\nopen and we'll continue in a month or two.</q></h2>\n<p>\nUmmm, probably not. If something is hot, then not, it could be dead.\nIt would be a mistake to <em>not</em> bill for work performed at this point\nand then let the chips fall where they may! Call in two months and someone\nelse may be in that job. And guess what? They don't know you at all...\n</p></p><p><h2>6. <q>Contract? We don't need no stinking contact! Aren't we friends?</q></h2></p><p><p>Yes, we are, until something goes wrong or is misunderstood, then you\nare the jerk in the suit and I am that idiot designer, then the contract\nis essential. That is, unless one doesn't care about being paid. Any\nreputable business uses paperwork to define relationships and you should\ntoo.\n</p></p><p><h2>7. <q>Send me a bill after the work goes to press.</q></h2>\n<p>\nWhy wait for an irrelevant deadline to send an invoice? You stand behind\nyour work, right? You are honest, right? Why would you feel bound to\nthis deadline? Once you deliver the work and it is accepted, <strong>BILL IT</strong>.\nThis point may just be a delaying tactic so the job goes through the\nprinter prior to any question of your being paid. If the guy waits for\nthe job to be printed, and you do changes as necessary, then he can stiff\nyou and not take a chance that he'll have to pay someone else for changes.\n</p></p><p><h2>8. <q>The last guy did it for XXX dollars.</q></h2></p><p><p>That is irrelevant. If the last guy was so good they wouldn't be talking\nto you, now would they? And what that guy charged means nothing to you,\nreally. People who charge too little for their time go out of business\n(or self-destruct financially, or change occupations) and then someone\nelse has to step in. Set a fair price and stick to it.\n</p></p><p><h2>9. <q>Our budget is XXX dollars, firm.</q></h2></p><p><p>\nAmazing, isn't it? This guy goes out to buy a car, and what, knows exactly\nwhat he is going to spend before even looking or researching? Not likely.\nA certain amount of work costs a certain amount of money. If they have\nless money (and you <em>can</em>), do less work and still take the job. But make\nsure they understand that you are doing less work if you take less money\nthat you originally estimated. Give fewer comps, simplify, let them go\nelsewhere for services (like films) etc.\n</p>\n<h2>10. <q>We are having financial problems. Give us the work, we'll\nmake some money and we'll pay you. Simple.</q></h2>\n<p>\nYeah, except when the money comes, you can expect that you will be pretty\nlow on the list to be paid. If someone reaches the point where they admit\nthat the company is in trouble, then they are probably much worse off\nthan they are admitting to. Even then, are you a bank? Are you qualified\nto check out their financials? If the company is strapped to the point\nwhere credit is a problem through credit agencies, banks etc. what business\nwould you have extending credit to them. You have exactly ZERO pull once\nthey have the work. Noble intentions or not, this is probably a losing\nbet. But if you are going to roll the dice, AT LEAST you should be getting\nadditional money for waiting. The bank gets interest and so should you.\nThat is probably why the person is approaching you; to get six months\nworth of free interest instead of paying bank rates for credit and then\npaying you with that money. Don't give away money.\n</p></p><p>\n<p>\nIn the end, working commercially, being great at what you do is about 25%\nof the task. If that is the only part of the task that you are interested\nin, do yourself a favor. Don't turn "pro."\n</p>\n \n
