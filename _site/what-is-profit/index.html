          <h2>What Is Profit</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>\n	When you're selling things &ndash; no matter whether it's <a href="http://links.purpur.co.uk/link.php?id=100">products</a>\n	or <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/services/uk/bcs/html/other/index_low.html">services</a> &ndash;\n	you want to be selling at a profit. You want to make money at it &mdash; that's\n	the point of the game.\n</p>\n<p>\n	But what is <q>profit</q>? I've had many conversations with colleagues,\n	clients and friends along the lines of:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n	So, you're selling this widget. It costs you &pound;15 and you're selling it\n	for &pound;20. That's <strong>&pound;5 pure profit</strong>.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n	Which usually means\n</p>	\n<blockquote>\n	You're trousering the fiver, so you can move a bit on your selling \n	price/commission rate.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n	Something very similar applies to project costings. The same clients, employees,\n	colleagues and friends tend to think that you subtract the cost of things\n	bought for the project (say software licensing, hosting and so on), and\n	the rest is <q>pure profit.</q>\n</p>\n<p>\n	But is that so? What does profit mean, and how do we make sure we're making\n	any (let alone enough)? Let's take a look.\n</p>\n<h2>What is Profit</h2>\n<p>\n	Profit is simply the final amount of money that the business makes, once <em>all</em>\n	the costs are paid from income (aka Revenue). But Revenue and Cost have to go a\n	long, long way before what's left makes its way into your trousers.\n</p></p><p><p>\n	What you're more interested in at a project level is <strong>Gross Profit</strong>.\n	That's Revenue, less all the things you had to do to earn it. On a software/development\n	project, the largest item is likely to be Labour &mdash; the amount the business\n	or subcontractors charges the project for use of people. But it'll also include:</p><p></p>\n<ul>\n	<li>any software you license for the project/client's use</li>\n	<li>any hardware you buy for the project/client's use</li>\n	<li>any custom development the project requires</li>\n	<li>any hosting/connectivity the project requires</li>\n	<li>all costs associated with enabling the people to work on the project,\n	so all travel/accommodation expenses for the project. Be careful about\n	which expenses are allocated to your project, and don't get confused that\n	the term Expenses is also somewhat interchangeable with Indirect Costs\n	(see below).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Generally, the most controllable element is going to be Labour. The other\n	elements are either pre-agreed with the client or already contractually locked at the\n	start of the project.\n</p>\n<p>\n	What you <em>can</em> do though is swap people about, swapping more expensive\n	people for less expensive if you're over-budget, rolling people on or\n	off if you're behind or ahead of schedule and so on. You can also drive the\n	team's sense of urgency to improve time and/or cost efficiency.\n</p>\n<h3>Measuring Project Success</h3>\n<p>\n	In many organisations, a <abbr title="Project Manager">PM</abbr>'s primary target is hitting the required level of\n	<acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, and often, this is fixed on a company or client level as a percentage\n	of Revenue. Hit (or exceed) the desired <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, and you're a hero. Miss the\n	target, even if you deliver some <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, and you're not.\n</p></p><p><h2>Beware - Fixed Costs Lurking</h2></p><p><p>But I hear you say</p>\n<blockquote>\n	What's the problem? I delivered 25% <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>. I know my target was 30% <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, but I\n	still brought in Profit, right? So I still did well.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n	Well, not necessarily. Why do you think the target was set at 30%? Was it\n	just corporate avarice and a desire to stick it to the customer? Possible,\n	but unlikely.\n</p>\n<p>\n	The reason for what might seem high targets is that the project's <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> has to\n	pay for a whole load of other costs, which are incurred no matter what the\n	size of the job, or whether you even do it at all.\n</p>\n<h3>\n	Quick Costs Quiz\n</h3>\n<p>\n	Who pays for the following:\n</p>\n<ol>\n	<li>Time spent selling</li>\n	<li>Your company's offices (premises, heating, phone, equipment)</li>\n	<li>Your site hosting</li>\n	<li>Staff salaries that aren't client chargeable</li>\n	<li>Training</li>\n	<li>Interest on Bank Loans</li>\n	<li>Advertising</li>\n	<li>Travel that's not client chargeable</li>\n	<li>Staff Holiday Time</li>\n	<li>Taxes</li>\n	<li>Developing new products and services</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n	Well, the business does. And it has to come from somewhere (sadly). So if\n	it doesn't come from clients, where <em>does</em> it come from? \n	Your project <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> has to contribute towards these costs, which\n	mount up every day, no matter how much business you're doing. \n</p>\n<p>\n	If you didn't spend them, sure, you'd have higher profits at the end. But\n	you'd seriously dent your capability to operate as a going concern. They're\n	fixed - there's very little you can do in the Project to affect them as you're\n	spending them <em>indirectly</em>. These costs are Expenses to the business\n	as a whole, rather than to your project and consist of everything the company\n	has to spend to develop products and services and bring them to the market.\n	They're called <strong>Fixed Costs aka Indirect Costs</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n	Now you've paid Direct Costs (leaving you with <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>) and Indirect Costs, what\n	you're left with is Pure Profit that the business owners can now trouser.\n	Right? Ah, no.\n</p>\n<h3>Death and..?</h3>\n<p>\n	Yes, you guessed it, Taxes. What you're left with at this point is a Pre-Tax\n	Income (<acronym>PTI</acronym>) aka Net Earnings Before Taxes \n	(<acronym>NEBT</acronym>). <acronym>PTI</acronym> is like your company's\n	salary. The <a href="http://www.stevesbeatles.com/songs/taxman.asp">Taxman</a> \n	has to have his slice before it goes near <em>anyone's</em> trousers. Depending\n	on where you work, this will a be combination of any number of national and local\n	taxes (<acronym title="Nota Bene">NB</acronym> for UK people, this might not \n	include <acronym title="Value Added Tax">VAT</acronym>, as depending on\n	how your accountant wants to handle it, it may be considered a Direct Cost\n	to the project).\n</p>\n<p>\n	Once the business has paid tax on what's left of the Revenue you brought in,\n	<em>then</em> &ndash; only then &ndash; can you look at the pittance that's\n	left and call it <q>Profit</q>.\n</p>\n<h2>Pricing for Profit</h2></p><p><p>\n	So that tidy nestegg of <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> that you \n	delivered to the company gets chopped up many ways to pay the project and \n	company's costs before it can be considered Profit.\n	This might be visible to you, so at the end of the year or project, \n	your (on-target, right?) <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> takes a \n	big charge for Indirect Costs (this is called Accruals). Or it might be \n	invisible - so you just deliver your GP to the company, and it all\n	happens behind the scenes. Either way, you <em>are</em> contributing to\n	those costs, so your initial pricing had better reflect those costs.\n</p></p><p><p>\n	At the start of this article, you may have thought something like <q>30%\n	Pure Profit? That's extortionate!</q> Hopefully now, you'll see it as something\n	more realistic. When you set your target <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>\n	for a project, you need to have an understanding of all the Direct and Indirect\n	Costs that the project will need to bear. Once you understand the true costs,\n	you're in a much better place to set a realistic price that leave the company\n	ahead of the game at the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n	But I hear you say:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n	But <strong>my</strong> clients won't pay prices that include such a high \n	<acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n	Might I respectfully suggest that you're working with clients who either\n	don't understand or (worse) don't care that you make enough to stay in\n	business? Hopefully the above will give you ammunition for your negotiations.\n	If you're doing small numbers of large projects, chances are that you're sharing the\n	Indirect Costs around more thinly, reduce the proportion of non-chargeable\n	staff time and take less management overhead than large numbers of small jobs. \n	So it's reasonable that larger projects attract a lower percentage charge for\n	Expenses, and therefore require lower <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>\n	targets.\n</p>\n<h2>Definitions</h2>\n<p>\n	To recap all those definitions (and a few more you might hear):\n</p>\n<dl>\n	<dt>Profit</dt>\n		<dd>\n			The final amount remaining after all costs have been paid from Revenue.\n			Very difficult to calculate on a project by project basis, so a project\n			usually talks about Gross Profit.\n		</dd>\n	<dt>Revenue</dt>\n		<dd>\n			The money that you charge to customers for providing products or\n			services.\n		</dd>\n	<dt>Costs</dt>\n		<dd>\n			The total money it takes to deliver the product or service; not only\n			the cost of producing the actual delivery, but also having an organisation\n			in place to do it.\n		</dd>\n	<dt>Direct (aka Variable) Costs</dt>\n		<dd>\n			The actual costs you can directly associate with each item or project.\n			These vary with the level of activity &mdash; sell/produce/deliver \n			more and your costs go up. You add a requirement? You add developer\n			time, and that's a direct cost. Need hosting for a client site?\n			That's a direct cost.\n		</dd>\n	<dt>Gross Profit</dt>\n		<dd>\n			A project's <acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym> is what many\n			people think of as profit - it's the project Revenue, less Direct\n			Costs. This is frequently expressed as a percentage of Revenue.\n		</dd>\n	<dt>Indirect (aka Fixed) Costs</dt>\n		<dd>\n			Costs you bear, whether you're delivering or not. Bank loans, admin\n			staff, heating, lighting, marketing &amp; sales; they're all indirect\n			costs.\n		</dd>\n	<dt>Expenses</dt>\n		<dd>\n			An expense is what is spent to bring a product to market and sell it.\n			This is an indirect cost, and shouldn't be confused with expenses that\n			your team charge for travel, accommodation etc (these are <em>direct</em> project\n			costs). The most common type of Expenses a Project Manager will have to\n			bear are SG&amp;A expenses - Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.\n		</dd>\n	<dt>Overhead</dt>\n		<dd>\n			Overhead is an expense that goes to maintain the organisation. This \n			might be management and admin staff. It's also the cost of people \n			who aren't directly billable, such as system quality assurance or \n			the operational support staff. It's equipment purchase/lease and\n			network connectivity. It's heating and lighting.\n		</dd>\n	<dt>Burden</dt>\n		<dd>\n			Burden is those expenses associated with employees. This includes \n			payroll taxes, benefits, and holiday. It also includes all the time\n			that your staff are sitting around, not earning Revenue (which is\n			why contractors are popular, although their rates will include an\n			amount to cover <em>their</em> Burden).\n		</dd> \n	<dt>Year-end Accruals</dt>\n		<dd>\n			Projects are often charged their Expenses at the end of the year &ndash;\n			they're all saved up (accrued) and dropped on the project in one go.\n		</dd>	\n	<dt>PTI (aka NEBT)</dt>\n		<dd>\n			Once you've taken all your Indirect costs away from your \n			<acronym title="Gross Profit">GP</acronym>, you're left with your\n			Net Earnings Before Taxes (<acronym>NEBT</acronym>) aka Pre-Tax\n			Income (<acronym>PTI</acronym>). Take off taxes from your company's\n			total PTI and you have Profit - <em>Pure</em> Profit at last!\n		</dd></p><p></dl>\n<h2>Bootnote</h2>\n<p>\n	All pricing, margin and Gross Profit figures above are fictitious and arbitrary, \n	used simply to illustrate the points.\n	\n</p>\n
