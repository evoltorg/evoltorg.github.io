<h2>\n      Why color matters even more\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      We all know that color can make or break a site. But beyond\n      eye candy appeal, color choices also impact usability and\n      accessibility.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Even if it looks great at a glance, the color scheme\n      doesn&#39;t work if many visitors can&#39;t easily find\n      crucial information, use whatever services are offered, and\n      effectively navigate the site. This could be up to <a\n      href="http://www.iamcal.com/toys/colors/stats.php"\n      target="_blank">1 in 12 people</a>, <strong>roughly 8%</strong> of the\n      site&#39;s audience.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Fear not. We don&#39;t need to use only boring colors or\n      limit our designs to imitations of Jakob Nielsen&#39;s <a\n      href="http://www.useit.com" target="_blank">UseIt</a>. Once\n      the problem is better defined, talented designers can come\n      up with their creative solutions.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      So with that goal in mind, let&#39;s review the research on\n      color and accessibility&#8212;from theory and practice to testing\n      and solutions.\n    </p>\n    <h2>\n      WCAG 1.0 and 2.0 on color\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      Perhaps the best place to begin is with the <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/" target="_blank">WC3 Web\n      Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG</a>). Since <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 1.0</a> is the current recommendation\n      but will soon be superseded by <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">WCAG\n      2.0</a>, the current working draft, let&#39;s take a look\n      at both.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n      WCAG 1.0\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 1.0</a>, the most relevant section is\n      as follows:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-color"\n      target="_blank">Guideline 2.</a>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        Don&#39;t rely on color alone. Ensure that text and\n        graphics are understandable when viewed without color. If\n        color alone is used to convey information, people who\n        cannot differentiate between certain colors and users\n        with devices that have non-color or non-visual displays\n        will not receive the information. When foreground and\n        background colors are too close to the same hue, they may\n        not provide sufficient contrast when viewed using\n        monochrome displays or by people with different types of\n        color deficits.\n      </p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      This seems perfectly reasonably and straightforward. But it\n      would help to have a working definition of &quot;sufficient\n      contrast,&quot; particularly in regard to people with color\n      deficits [i.e., &quot;color-blind&quot;]. Fortunately, we\n      have just that defined <a href="/Understanding_Color_and_Accessibility#s-c">below</a>&#8212;no guessing\n      or <strong>&quot;does that look like sufficient contrast to\n      you&quot;</strong> required. But before treating <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"\n      target="_blank">1.0</a> as done, let&#39;s also consider <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">WCAG\n      2.0</a>, and how it evolves from <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"\n      target="_blank">1.0</a>\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n      WCAG 2.0\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 2.0</a>, the most relevant sections\n      are as follows:\n    </p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation"\n       target="_blank">Guideline 1.3</a> Ensure that information,\n      functionality, and structure are separable from\n      presentation.\n      <br />\n       <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast"\n      target="_blank">Guideline 1.4</a> Make it easy to\n      distinguish foreground information from background images\n      or sounds.\n    </blockquote>\n    <p>\n      Clearly, the suggestions in <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">WCAG\n      2.0</a> are both stricter and more comprehensive. Whereas\n      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"\n      target="_blank">1.0</a> emphasizes the screen, version <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank">2.0</a>\n      emphasizes the multi-device web: screen, print, handheld,\n      aural, braille, embossed, projection, tty, tv, and whatever\n      else comes along.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n      What both WCAG 1.0 and 2.0 require\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 1.0</a>, we need both sufficient\n      contrast and to ensure that text and graphics work without\n      color. But for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 2.0</a>, everything&#8212;information,\n      functionality and structure&#8212;has to (1) work without color;\n      and (2) be &quot;sufficiently contrasted&quot; with\n      (clearly distinguished from) any background.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      So let&#39;s start with &quot;sufficient contrast,&quot;\n      particularly for people with color deficits. We need to get\n      this right for both <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 1.0</a> and <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"\n      target="_blank">2.0</a>. Again, however, here we benefit\n      from the hard work of other people.\n    </p>\n    <h2>\n      <a name="s-c" id="s-c">Understanding &quot;sufficient\n      contrast&quot;</a>\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      <a href="http://more.btexact.com/people/rigdence/colours/"\n      target="_blank">Christine Rigden</a>, a web design\n      professional for <em>BT Exact</em>, explains the three\n      kinds of color vision deficiency and provides color\n      palettes along with plenty of how-to information. She even\n      offers an outstanding <a\n      href="http://more.btexact.com/people/rigdence/colours/colours.pdf"\n       target="_blank">PDF</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Although Ridgen comes close to explaining everything we\n      need to know both simply and well, there are other\n      excellent resources.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For a shorter but interactive version based on Ridgen&#39;s\n      work (and some other references), Cal Henderson does a\n      great job with <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/toys/colors/"\n      target="_blank">Color Vision</a>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Likewise, Lighthouse International&#39;s <a\n      href="http://www.lighthouse.org/color_contrast.htm"\n      target="_blank">Effective Color Contrast</a> offers a\n      simple and effective demonstration as to what works, what\n      doesn&#39;t, and why.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Otherwise, for the person who wants even more information\n      and has the science background, Thomas G. Wolfmaier&#39;s\n      <a\n      href="http://www.internettg.org/newsletter/mar99/accessibility_color_challenged.html"\n       target="_blank">Designing for the Color-Challenged: A\n      Challenge</a> explains in detail the statistical\n      occurrences of color vision deficiency, the finer points of\n      Red-Green defects and Blue-Yellow defects, and so on.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Finally, for person who prefers hands-on learning,\n      you&#39;ve lucked out twice. The Net provides two excellent\n      tools which simulate how sites appear to people with\n      different types of color deficits.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n      Testing your design\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      <a href="http://www.vischeck.com/index.php"\n      target="_blank">Vischeck</a> offers &quot;sufficient\n      contrast&quot; testing for <a\n      href="http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckURL.php"\n      target="_blank">URLs</a> and <a\n      href="http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckImage.php"\n      target="_blank">images</a>. Additionally, at <a\n      href="http://www.vischeck.com/index.php"\n      target="_blank">Vischeck</a> the user can <a\n      href="http://www.vischeck.com/daltonize/"\n      target="_blank">Daltonize</a> an image.\n      (<em>Daltonize</em>: &quot;a digital image processing\n      technique that can make print or video display more salient\n      to color blind people without distorting the color balance\n      to an unacceptable degree&quot;).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Similarly, the <a\n      href="http://colorlab.wickline.org/colorblind/colorlab/"\n      target="_blank">Color Laboratory</a> also offers a <a\n      href="http://colorfilter.wickline.org/"\n      target="_blank">Web Page Filter</a> that simulates how\n      sites will appear to people with different types of color\n      deficits.\n    </p>\n    <h3>\n      The good news\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      Between <a\n      href="http://more.btexact.com/people/rigdence/colours/"\n      target="_blank">Ridgen</a> to <a\n      href="http://www.internettg.org/newsletter/mar99/accessibility_color_challenged.html"\n       target="_blank">Wolfmaier</a>, and with <a\n      href="http://www.vischeck.com/index.php"\n      target="_blank">Vischeck</a> &amp; <a\n      href="http://colorlab.wickline.org/colorblind/colorlab/"\n      target="_blank">Color Laboratory</a>, we have all the\n      practical information, hard science, examples, and testing\n      tools needed to establish whether or not a site has\n      &quot;sufficient contrast&quot; for people with color\n      deficits.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Furthermore, even commercial  companies are developing\n      solutions. <a href="http://www.visibone.com/"\n      target="_blank">VisiBone</a> offers an inexpensive but very\n      useful <a href="http://www.visibone.com/color/card.html"\n      target="_blank">Color Card</a> and <a\n      href="http://www.visibone.com/color/chart.html"\n      target="_blank">Color Chart</a>, both of which also show\n      how the standard web palette appears to people with color\n      deficits. Others offer free for download the <a\n      href="http://www.jessett.com/web_sites/usability/colour_blindness.shtml">\n      Adobe Photoshop versions</a> of the Protanopia\n      (red-deficit) and Deuteranopia (green-deficit) palettes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Let&#39;s finish where we started: With the practical\n      implications of designing for people with different types\n      of color deficits, particularly in regard to <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/" target="_blank">Web\n      Accessibility Initiative</a> guidelines.\n    </p>\n    <h2>\n      From theory to practice\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 1.0</a>, the bottom line is simple:\n      sufficient contrast does not mean boring or blandness.\n      Rather, it involves learning about and avoiding certain\n      foreground-background combinations&#8212;combinations that will\n      not work for <a\n      href="http://www.iamcal.com/toys/colors/stats.php"\n      target="_blank">1 in 12 people, roughly 8%</a> of the\n      population. Otherwise, the designer still has 16.7 million colors \n      to command.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 2.0</a> and the multi-device web, the\n      bottom line is a bit more complex: how color will be\n      rendered (if at all) is device-dependent. So the emphasis\n      shifts to using the tactics in <a\n      href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 1.0</a> for most visual outputs (screen, print, \n      tv, projection), but also\n      ensuring that information, functionality, and structure can\n      be (re)presented for non-visual outputs\n      (aural, braille, embossed) and alternative\n       visual outputs (tty, handheld).\n    </p>\n    <p>Obviously, some of these output media make effective\n     use of color; others will not use color at all.</p>\n    <p>\n    \n      This design practice&#8212;for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"\n      target="_blank">WCAG 2.0</a> and the future&#8212; is not about the\n      familiar mantra of separating style from content. Rather,\n      as Owen Briggs rightly suggests, it is about having content with <a\n      href="http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/design_rant/2.html"\n       target="_blank">multiple presentation options</a>.   \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Publish once, present everywhere with appropriate styling\n      for all standards-compliant devices. This&#8212;one could\n      argue&#8212;is the writer&#39;s, the publisher&#39;s, and the\n      designer&#39;s dream.
