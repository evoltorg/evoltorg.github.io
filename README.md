Categories
==

The category lists are generated by a plugin which takes all the tags and creates listing pages, because github doesn't support plugins for jekyll sites, these category pages need to be copied manually to the base of the site so that gihub copies them

Editing content
===
Code can be edited by hand or you can locally manage the content with something like [pagoda|https://github.com/alagu/pagoda] which gives you a UI

Making articles 'sticky'
==

To promote articles to the top of the listing, just add the sticky category to the front-matter section of the content.
